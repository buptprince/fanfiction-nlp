7759693,2,1,"A second trip to the local healing clinic (a hairline fracture--easily fixed) and an awkward explanation to his mom later, Midoriya is back at home and condemned from leaving the house--regardless of whether or not he wants to test out his new abilities."
7759693,2,2,"But despite the house arrest, Midoriya can’t help but smile. His mom seems pretty excited, too--she witnessed his rock firsthand, and although she can’t entirely grasp how it took Izuku fourteen years to figure out bending, she’s ecstatic for her son."
7759693,2,3,"She bustles around the house, pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time."
7759693,2,4,"“Oh, I’m so excited for you, Izuku! Earthbending! Can you believe it? I’m going to make you a cake. And I’ll call your father--oh! He’ll be so surprised! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats--”"
7759693,2,5,"“Mom. Mom--thank you. I’m happy you’re excited, too,” Midoriya interrupts, walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter. He smiles warmly. “But seriously, you don’t have to make me a cake. I kind of just want to go to bed right now, I’m beat.”"
7759693,2,6,"She blinks, then beams back at him. “Oh, of course! It’s been quite the day for you--I should have figured you’d want to sleep.”"
7759693,2,7,"She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter, shuffling over to her son. Standing on tiptoes, she deposits a kiss on Midoriya’s forehead."
7759693,2,8,"“I’m very proud of you,” she says softly. “You never gave up, did you?”"
7759693,2,9,"He smiles, then shakes his head slowly. She holds his shoulders, tears beading at the corners of her eyes."
7759693,2,10,"He kisses her forehead in turn, then pulling away to walk towards his bedroom."
7759693,2,11,"“Night, Mom.”"
7759693,2,12,"“Goodnight, Izuku.”"
7759693,2,13,"The door closes behind him and he plops onto his bed, dwelling on what a day it’s been."
7759693,2,14,"How could his life have changed so much in 24 hours? How could he have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar?"
7759693,2,15,"Midoriya flops backwards, and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him."
7759693,2,16,"He needs to go back to the Spirit World to talk to All Might and figure out his plan, pronto."
7759693,2,17,"The only method he knows of is sleep--when he falls asleep, he should be able to go there."
7759693,2,18,"So he tries. He lays on his bed, staring blankly at the ceiling."
7759693,2,19,"This should be easy--he's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the Spirit World, so he should be able to cross over with no problem. He just needs to focus, to try to meditate and cross that chasm."
7759693,2,20,"But as he gazes upwards and tries to clear his thoughts, muffled worries cloud his mind."
7759693,2,21,"Why wasn't I able to bend up until now? What's wrong with me?"
7759693,2,22,"Who do I talk to? I don't know what to do and I can't contact my only source of advice."
7759693,2,23,"What if I can't get into Yuuei? How will I master bending if I don't go there--will I have to leave home? Without telling my mom?"
7759693,2,24,"The Spirit World slips from his grasp and he shifts to his side with a weary sigh, resigning himself to a restless sleep."
7759693,2,25,"x"
7759693,2,26,"There’s no school the next day and his mom leaves the house telling him to stay put and rest--but the second she closes the door behind her, he pulls on a jacket and slides on his shoes."
7759693,2,27,"He’s not well, but he can’t rest easy until he knows the full extent of his bending abilities. He has to see if he can bend more than just earth and air."
7759693,2,28,"Past the back lot and under the cover of trees, Midoriya comes to a stop. His head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his senses slightly, but overall he feels much more focused and refreshed. He uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground, then goes to stand five feet away."
7759693,2,29,"First up: waterbending."
7759693,2,30,"He mimics the movements he sees all the time on TV--the back and forth, the pushing and pulling, the fluid arm circles."
7759693,2,31,"But the movements are too smooth, too gentle--he can’t figure out how to transfer his energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending."
7759693,2,32,"He tries for a couple more minutes, then drops the positioning with a sigh."
7759693,2,33,"Okay, now for the one he has even less hope with: firebending."
7759693,2,34,"It’s the same deal as waterbending; he goes through the pro motions, sharp jabs and thrusts. But the sheer emotion equated with firebending, the power that those benders display--Midoriya can’t tap into it."
7759693,2,35,"Sure, he’s got fight in him."
7759693,2,36,"But he can’t seem to draw it out in the form of fire."
7759693,2,37,"He treks back home, disappointed but not surprised."
7759693,2,38,"All that’s left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers."
7759693,2,39,"x"
7759693,2,40,"He tries for a week: meditating, deep breathing, music. Anything to relax and help him cross over."
7759693,2,41,"But nothing works. He always begins to think of his troubles, to worry about the path ahead."
7759693,2,42,"It’s a cycle--his anxiety means he can’t make it to the Spirit World, but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him even more anxiety. It’s excessively stupid and he knows that he needs to calm down, to let his worries go."
7759693,2,43,"But he can’t. That’s not in his nature."
7759693,2,44,"It’s after another failed attempt that Midoriya hoists himself, blurry-eyed, from the bed. He goes to sit at his desk, head in his hands, staring at the wood grain below."
7759693,2,45,"He’s beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All Might was a fever dream, that he’s the avatar but he never actually had that discussion with his predecessor."
7759693,2,46,"Why is he so bad at this? Wasn’t this supposed to come naturally?"
7759693,2,47,"He stares at the desk for another second, then raises his head. Reaching for his laptop, he flips it open and frantically types."
7759693,2,48,"avatar life biographies"
7759693,2,49,"It’s a dumb Google search, he knows. But he needs to know that he’s not alone, that what he’s going through is normal."
7759693,2,50,"He clicks the first link and begins to read."
7759693,2,51,"An airbending avatar, 10 lifetimes back, that didn’t master all the elements until she was 36. A firebending avatar, 3 lifetimes ago, that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State. Another earthbender, 8 lifetimes past, that avoided all other kinds of bending, finding them foreign and difficult."
7759693,2,52,"The story that comforts him the most is All Might’s."
7759693,2,53,"“Avatar Toshinori was reportedly unable to visit the Spirit World until he was eighteen,” the article reads. “When asked about the most difficult part of his journey to become a fully-realized avatar, he responded with: ‘the spiritual aspect.’”"
7759693,2,54,"Midoriya stares at the words, a faint smile creeping on his face."
7759693,2,55,"He’s not alone. He’s never been alone. His struggle has been going on for centuries, and he’s far from the first avatar to not know what to do."
7759693,2,56,"Even when a deep tiredness settles into his bones, he continues to scroll through his past lives."
7759693,2,57,"He feels connected."
7759693,2,58,"When he begins to doze off, cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer, there’s something like a humming that leaks into his ears. He lets his eyes sink shut, and the humming overtakes him, filling his ears and sinking into his limbs."
7759693,2,59,"He lets it engulf him."
7759693,2,60,"x"
7759693,2,61,"He can sense the difference before his eyes even flick open."
7759693,2,62,"The air around him feels lighter, the ache of his limbs fading and the weight of his eyelids lessening."
7759693,2,63,"He blinks, taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery. But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen."
7759693,2,64,"A sense of panic settles in his core."
7759693,2,65,"“All Might?” he questions quietly. Only silence greets him. Then it hits him."
7759693,2,66,"It's just silence--no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees, like last time. Simply eerie quietness, thick and foreboding."
7759693,2,67,"Something’s wrong."
7759693,2,68,"Midoriya whips around, suddenly growing paranoid that he's being watched. The landscape seems to darken, the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint. He nervously scans, trying to find the source of his unease."
7759693,2,69,"A wave of something hits him, grim and heavy. Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he fights it, struggling to stay upright and standing. Then he sees it."
7759693,2,70,"Maybe it's his imagination--there’s shifting on a tree 15 feet to his left, almost a crawling motion, digits spidering their way across the trunk. Pale fingers…"
7759693,2,71,"A hand, but not attached to a body."
7759693,2,72,"He chokes back a muffled cry of horror, stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction."
7759693,2,73,"He runs from that evil aura, the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him whole. Midoriya is no expert on the Spirit World, but he knows that that is not supposed to be there. He wheezes and weaves between trees, attempting to get away as fast as possible."
7759693,2,74,"The invading emotions slowly fade as he puts distance between him and the thing, to his relief. He slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree, trying to catch his breath."
7759693,2,75,"But a new sensation appears, less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull. It's the polar opposite of what he felt merely a few minutes ago: it's hope, it's reassurance and guidance. Midoriya straightens up, tiredly shuffling in what he thinks is the right direction."
7759693,2,76,"It isn't a far walk--only about five minutes--until he reaches the edge of the forest, the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills. Midoriya merely blinks slowly, until a voice calls his name somewhere to his left."
7759693,2,77,"He turns to see the former avatar, picking his way over tree roots towards him."
7759693,2,78,"Thank god."
7759693,2,79,"Midoriya walks over to meet him, the man’s presence putting him at ease."
7759693,2,80,"“You haven’t been here in a while, my boy,” All Might says, clapping Midoriya on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he’s only met once. “Troubles getting back to the Spirit World?”"
7759693,2,81,"Midoriya shrinks. “Yes… It took me a bit to figure out how to get here, but I think I’ve got it now.”"
7759693,2,82,"“I’m glad--I’ve got a feeling that there would have been trouble, had you learned any later.”"
7759693,2,83,"The man gives him a small smile and a final back pat, then turning to sit on a raised tree root. He seems relaxed, nonchalant."
7759693,2,84,"But something in his words bother Midoriya. He hesitates, then asks."
7759693,2,85,"“What do you mean by ‘trouble?’”"
7759693,2,86,"All Might freezes, like he’s been caught in some secret act. It feels… weird, pressing his childhood hero to share information with him, but Midoriya stays firm, fixing his mentor with a questioning stare."
7759693,2,87,"He has to familiarize himself with his past life. They have to be open with each other, and that connection starts with no secrets."
7759693,2,88,"Something in Midoriya’s look must tell All Might this; he sighs."
7759693,2,89,"“Well, I suppose you would’ve learned sooner or later, anyhow,” All Might says, scooching to the left and patting the root next to him. Midoriya pauses, then walks over to sit."
7759693,2,90,"There’s a moment of silence as All Might formulates what to say; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead. Midoriya just watches his hands, letting the avatar think."
7759693,2,91,"The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya locks eyes with his mentor, now donning a grim expression."
7759693,2,92,"“I’ll cut to the chase: something dark is on the horizon,” All Might says, black eyes boring into Midoriya’s. “For both your world and mine.”"
7759693,2,93,"“What… What is it?” Midoriya asks hesitantly."
7759693,2,94,"All Might sighs. “I wish that I knew, my boy.”"
7759693,2,95,"“Well, what makes you think that, then? Have you been seeing something, had to fight someone?”"
7759693,2,96,"All Might rises and stands in front of Midoriya, almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless."
7759693,2,97,"“There's a group--a league, I should say--that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the Spirit World. I've spotted them a few times here, and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances, too.” All Might scratches at the top of his head, staring off into the woods. “They're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities … Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand…”"
7759693,2,98,"Midoriya shudders and All Might stops."
7759693,2,99,"“Midoriya? Did you see one of them?”"
7759693,2,100,"The boy fidgets. “Um, yes.” He fiddles with his fingers, looking down at the ground. “I thought I spotted a hand… It felt like it was watching me.. And it was radiating these awful emotions…”"
7759693,2,101,"All Might mutters curses under his breath, stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya’s shoulders."
7759693,2,102,"“I’m sorry you had to witness that, my boy. I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to--but I can say this,” he says, locking eyes with his successor. “Don’t try to find out what it is. Not yet.”"
7759693,2,103,"Midoriya breathes sharply. “But, All Might--”"
7759693,2,104,"“You’re not ready to face off with whatever this is,” he cuts Midoriya off. “I understand you want to help, but for now the best thing you can do is lay low and train. You have a lot of missed time to make up for.”"
7759693,2,105,"He has a point--what could Midoriya even do right now? The boy slumps a little, the argument lost."
7759693,2,106,"“Don’t worry,” All Might says. “It hasn’t done anything too villainous, as of yet. Plus, I have contacts in the real world that are trying to find its source. We’ll know what it is, soon enough.”"
7759693,2,107,"Midoriya tenses at “contacts,” recalling what he came here to ask about. “Uh, All Might, about the real world…”"
7759693,2,108,"“You’re not sure what you’re supposed to be doing, right?” All Might responds. “We’re connected--I can feel your confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand.”"
7759693,2,109,"The words stolen from his mouth, Midoriya freezes for a second, then nods weakly. He shrugs away from the avatar’s grasp, rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace."
7759693,2,110,"“I don’t even know where to start,” he mutters, hand on his chin as he walks back and forth. “Do I just come out and announce it…”"
7759693,2,111,"“Midoriya.”"
7759693,2,112,"“Or keep it quiet--”"
7759693,2,113,"“Breathe.”"
7759693,2,114,"“Or just train in one element, or--”"
7759693,2,115,"“You’re overthinking this, my boy.”"
7759693,2,116,"“But am I?” Midoriya frantically shoots back, stopping in his tracks."
7759693,2,117,"All Might pauses, then belts out a laugh."
7759693,2,118,"It’s contagious--Midoriya can’t help but crack into a smile, then a chuckle, and then a full laugh."
7759693,2,119,"They both laugh longer than the situation warrants, but when they finally stop, Midoriya feels more relaxed. Something about the avatar just calls for calm--in the face of the daunting, he still manages to put on a smile."
7759693,2,120,"He wasn’t the “most charismatic avatar” for nothing, Midoriya guesses."
7759693,2,121,"“I’m sorry to laugh, kid--I’m just very happy to see you so serious about this,” All Might says, seating himself again. “Okay, back to business. You know the traditional path an avatar takes.”"
7759693,2,122,"“Yes: you’re told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements. You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle--for me, that would be earth, fire, air, water,” Midoriya says. “But I’ve already diverged from all of that.”"
7759693,2,123,"“True,” the former avatar agrees. “You’re making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case. But that’s okay. Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine.”"
7759693,2,124,"“Yeah, but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen,” Midoriya murmurs, earning a sad look from All Might."
7759693,2,125,"“You can’t dwell on that, Midoriya,” the man says softly. “You’re a unique case.”"
7759693,2,126,"“What did you say it was--that my energy was blocked?” Midoriya questions. “How did it suddenly get unblocked? Why was it blocked in the first place?”"
7759693,2,127,"“Like I said earlier--it was a combination of different factors: emotional stunting, insecurity, et cetera,” All Might replies, shifting on his perch. He scratches the top of his head, looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya’s shoulder. “And--er, this isn’t for certain, but… it may have also been my fault.”"
7759693,2,128,"Midoriya tenses. “What?”"
7759693,2,129,"The avatar sighs. “My fight with All For One didn’t just leave my body scarred. They tried to keep it from the public--it would have sent everything into even more chaos, if they had--but: there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish, as well."
7759693,2,130,"“All For One had two main goals: firstly, to gain control of Harmony and, by extent, all four nations. But their second, more ominous goal, was… crazy. Theoretically impossible. Unless, that is, you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World.”"
7759693,2,131,"“He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World--that is, places that could ‘grant’ bending. I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar.”"
7759693,2,132,"It’s faint--a slight hesitancy to All Might’s words, a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya’s stomach."
7759693,2,133,"Is he afraid ?"
7759693,2,134,"In an instant, All Might suddenly seems so much smaller, so much more scared and lost and dead ."
7759693,2,135,"Is this what’s in store for me, too? Or will it be worse ?"
7759693,2,136,"He shudders as All Might begins to speak again."
7759693,2,137,"“Now, whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge--or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds, but… All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World, regardless. And he was going to do it by force.”"
7759693,2,138,"“So… you weren’t just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony,” Midoriya says. “You were fighting to avoid being captured, too.”"
7759693,2,139,"All Might nods. “And what a fight it was. It took everything I had to hold him at bay. I’m guessing you already know this, but I had to go into the Avatar State. No small feat, but it worked and I almost had him finished. But then I got hit.” He grimaces at the memory, placing a hand over his concealed wound. “I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy.”"
7759693,2,140,"Midoriya furrows his brow. “But… sustaining injuries in the Avatar State isn’t enough to end the Cycle. Or block energy.”"
7759693,2,141,"“You’re right, the injury itself wasn’t what did it,” the man replies, with a hint of… embarrassment? Shame? “But after taking that hit, I was… I didn’t know if I would win, and I didn’t want to be the one to end the Cycle. So I went out of the State for the rest of the fight.”"
7759693,2,142,"A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya’s head."
7759693,2,143,"“You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself,” he states. “And ashamed that you left the State, even though staying in it could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city. So you blocked a chakra point.”"
7759693,2,144,"All Might blinks. “Er. Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras.”"
7759693,2,145,"Midoriya flushes, waving his hands in apology. “Oh, I’m so sorry--that was insensitive of me--”"
7759693,2,146,"“No, my boy, it’s fine.” All Might gives him a small smile. “Butting your head into other people’s business is the mark of a good avatar. And it’s good to see you already know about your chakras--those are important.”"
7759693,2,147,"The blood doesn’t leave Midoriya’s face, and he squeaks out a thank you."
7759693,2,148,"“So yes, like you said,” All Might starts again slowly. “I didn’t resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime, and ended up clogging my fire chakra--willpower, blocked by shame.”"
7759693,2,149,"“But why would that block all of my bending?” Midoriya questions."
7759693,2,150,"“Well--my theory is that I didn’t just have one chakra clogged.” The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead. “Thought chakra. Pure cosmic energy, blocked by worldly attachments. And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice.”"
7759693,2,151,"“And you think that carried over into my chakras,” Midoriya concludes."
7759693,2,152,"“I’ll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ‘spiritual aspect’ as some of the former avatars. So I don’t know if my running theory actually works,” All Might says. “And while I’ve come to terms with my fate and emotions, I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person--but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years.”"
7759693,2,153,"So that’s what the whole forehead thing was last time, Midoriya thinks. But what kind of disconnect…"
7759693,2,154,"“But what’s important is that you’re here now and you’ve already bended two elements,” All Might says, interrupting Midoriya’s thoughts. “You’ve also attempted water and fire, correct?”"
7759693,2,155,"Midoriya nods. “But I wasn’t able to do either. I can’t really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those.”"
7759693,2,156,"“Don’t rush it,” All Might advises. “You’ve only just entered the bending world, so start with earth, move to air, and then attempt the other two. Every avatar has an element they struggle with--mine was fire.” He looks Midoriya up and down. “And I feel like yours will be, as well.”"
7759693,2,157,"“How can you tell?”"
7759693,2,158,"All Might tents his hands, fingertips on his lips. “You’ll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are… Self-destructive. Angry. Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be.”"
7759693,2,159,"Midoriya’s brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan, which he shoves down immediately."
7759693,2,160,"“I feel as though you’ve only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life. You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot, without the right master,” he continues. “And even then, it may take some time. The meanings of each element must be learned--and as someone who’s always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender, its meaning might not come easy.”"
7759693,2,161,"The knowing look All Might gives Midoriya tells him that he knows all about Bakugou. Midoriya returns a nervous smile."
7759693,2,162,"“It will take time of course. I know you want to have a step-by-step plan, something to follow to the letter. But you must remember: a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy.”"
7759693,2,163,"Midoriya must look confused, because the former avatar sighs."
7759693,2,164,"“The flow--whether it be in your bending, in conflicts, in your own life. You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind,” All Might says. “While I am here to give you advice, I am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment.”"
7759693,2,165,"The boy already knew all that, but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real."
7759693,2,166,"“Your hardships and battles will be different than mine. You cannot copy me--that’ll only end in tragedy.”"
7759693,2,167,"Midoriya gazes up at his predecessor, the weight of his words settling on his shoulders."
7759693,2,168,"He can ask for guidance, but the final decisions will be up to him."
7759693,2,169,"He can save the world, but he might not be able to save himself."
7759693,2,170,"The nod of understanding he gives feels like the click of a lock on his heart. There’s no backing out; his fate is intertwined with that of the world."
7759693,2,171,"All Might responds with a grim smile."
7759693,2,172,"“So tell me ,” the man says, rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees. Midoriya begins to follow, only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb. He’s once again in that black void, nothing but him, darkness, and the boom of his mentor’s voice."
7759693,2,173,"“What are you going to do?”"
7759693,2,174,"He trains like hell."
7759693,2,175,"If he's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones don't shatter first."
7759693,2,176,"His immediate goal: fortify his plans for the future, fortify his body, and fortify his mind."
7759693,2,177,"Step number one: build muscle, work on power output, and prep himself for the Yuuei entrance exam."
7759693,2,178,"He’s been doing this for years--fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones, staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it. He’ll still have to save the world someday, but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei."
7759693,2,179,"As to why he's so dead set on Yuuei... it's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling."
7759693,2,180,"Simply put, it feels like fate."
7759693,2,181,"(Midoriya can't deny that All Might attending the school in his youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school.)"
7759693,2,182,"But the abundance of masters teaching there, the interdisciplinary focus in the bending, the probable contacts All Might has there--it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars."
7759693,2,183,"So Yuuei it is."
7759693,2,184,"His life becomes a collage of bending matches, gyms, and the quiet lot behind his house. Anywhere where no one will stop him from practicing. When he’s not in school, he’s sweating--pulling up rocks, seeing which moves work for him and which ones don’t."
7759693,2,185,"The internet helps him more than he would like to admit. Step-by-step power position tutorials, workout regiments, bending match videos--they’re abundant and easily accessible, and Midoriya finds himself compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he has a semblance of an actual workout schedule."
7759693,2,186,"x"
7759693,2,187,"There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam: power and combat. Midoriya can learn combat moves by himself by watching pro matches--but the power portion might prove to be a challenge, without direction."
7759693,2,188,"He can’t figure out how to increase his power. He has a set limit, but honestly, it’s not enough ."
7759693,2,189,"But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his might in the fighting ring, it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide."
7759693,2,190,"So Midoriya finds himself back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter, luckily encountering no shadowy hands."
7759693,2,191,"He pitches his idea to All Might: teach Midoriya the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him pass the exam."
7759693,2,192,"The proposition brings a smile to All Might’s face. He beams, then places a large hand on Midoriya’s head."
7759693,2,193,"“Don’t worry,” he assures. “I have just the move in mind.”"
7759693,2,194,"x"
7759693,2,195,"It’s backbreaking work. Even sleep no longer offers a refuge, due to power sessions with All Might."
7759693,2,196,"School, combat training, power practice, repeat. The months fly by and Midoriya hardly notices."
7759693,2,197,"Of course there are moments when he doubts what he’s doing--is Yuuei actually worth this? He’s the avatar --can’t he put off the hellish training until later? He’s going to get a master no matter what, so why panic?"
7759693,2,198,"But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom, Midoriya is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he’s doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity, fourteen years of missed bending experience."
7759693,2,199,"If he wants to train with the best, he has to put himself on equal footing first--his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei."
7759693,2,200,"So despite his doubts, despite his fatigue, he pushes forward. He sees results."
7759693,2,201,"He’s sturdier, in mind and in body. He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal. He has an All Might specialty move, guaranteed to max his power output."
7759693,2,202,"When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon, Midoriya actually feels like he’s standing at the starting line."
7759693,2,203,"Midoriya shuffles past the Yuuei gates, his throat in his stomach and his legs trembling."
7759693,2,204,"He did okay on the written portion--a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics, the history of bending, and what-would-you-do scenarios. There were only one or two he didn’t know at all, and a couple more he was hesitant about, but it seems likely he scored well."
7759693,2,205,"Now comes the tough part."
7759693,2,206,"He’s forcing himself to be calm, clasping his hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep, controlled breaths. He closes his eyes."
7759693,2,207,"The worst that can happen is he has to go to another bending school. He’s prepared for this. He’s done as much as he can. It’s all a matter of showing that work now."
7759693,2,208,"Slightly calmer, Midoriya’s eyes flick back open. A small smile creeps onto his face and he takes a big step forward--"
7759693,2,209,"Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement."
7759693,2,210,"He topples but his mind stays strangely clear."
7759693,2,211,"Of course, his brain sighs, resigned to its fate. Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life. You wouldn’t be Midoriya Izuku if you didn’t pull some clutzy move like this. So stupid."
7759693,2,212,"Right before he gets a faceful of asphalt, however, there’s a whoosh and suddenly he isn’t falling."
7759693,2,213,"In fact, he’s floating."
7759693,2,214,"Midoriya’s eyes go wide and he yelps, scrambling to get upright. The air begins to assist him upwards, bringing him from 20º to 90º. His feet firmly planted on the ground again, Midoriya turns to find his savior."
7759693,2,215,"“Are you okay?” A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him, arms still raised from bending. Her big brown eyes look him up and down, questioning and caring."
7759693,2,216,"Midoriya merely stares."
7759693,2,217,"“Sorry for not asking before using my bending on you,” she continues, shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip. “I figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam!”"
7759693,2,218,"She tilts her head and beams."
7759693,2,219,"Midoriya feels himself nearly go into cardiac arrest."
7759693,2,220,"“Uh,” he eloquently responds."
7759693,2,221,"“Well, we better get inside--they’re starting soon. I’m so nervous! But let’s both do our best, okay?”"
7759693,2,222,"“Um,” he tries again."
7759693,2,223,"“Good luck!” she says, turning to continue her way across the courtyard. Only his eyes follow, watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building."
7759693,2,224,"He doesn’t think of how mortifying that was. He doesn’t think of how experienced the benders he’s up against must be, for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep. He doesn’t even think about the dreaded exam."
7759693,2,225,"His brain simply spits out:"
7759693,2,226,"I talked to a girl!"
7759693,2,227,"Midoriya stands there, beaming like an idiot, until someone bumps into his shoulder."
7759693,2,228,"“Get moving, shitty Deku,” they growl."
7759693,2,229,"It pulls him out of his reverie; he jumps at the sight of Kacchan’s red glare boring into him--but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors."
7759693,2,230,"No taunting. No teasing. Nothing."
7759693,2,231,"It’s true that Bakugou had been a lot more reserved following the… incident. Whereas previous help from Midoriya spurred on relentless insults, this time Bakugou seemed recoil from any contact at all.  Is he ashamed? Angry?"
7759693,2,232,"Either way, Midoriya finds that the lack of attention--positive or negative--is off-putting. It feels like Bakugou is plotting something."
7759693,2,233,"(Or that Bakugou thinks he’s plotting something.)"
7759693,2,234,"Midoriya tries to wipe that unease from his mind, changing his thoughts to the task ahead. He sighs, then follows his neighbor through those daunting doors."
7759693,2,235,"They’re greeted by a towering stage, the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls. A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session, then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya would like."
7759693,2,236,"The silence from Bakugou is deafening; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands, neither acknowledging the other’s presence."
7759693,2,237,"The air is thick with tension, awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions. Some stretch in place, some control their breathing, and some just sit and stare."
7759693,2,238,"Midoriya finds himself in the last category, trying to push down the trembling in his stomach as he watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him."
7759693,2,239,"What was he thinking? He literally only learned how to earthbend--what, ten months ago? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he to think that he could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself a spot in the top bending school in the city?"
7759693,2,240,"Stupid, stupid, stupid."
7759693,2,241,"Midoriya nervously adjusts the green armband on his forearm--an earthbender. Just an earthbender."
7759693,2,242,"He needs to keep it that way."
7759693,2,243,"If people find out that he’s the avatar, they also find out that All Might is dead. The fragile peace that All Might’s image has upheld since the rebellion collapses, and he’s forced to deal with the aftermath--untrained. Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar wasn’t even able to bend up until 10 months ago."
7759693,2,244,"He might consider telling some of the Yuuei staff if he actually gets in--some of them might already know, even--, but it’s essential that he keep this secret until he’s mastered Earth at least."
7759693,2,245,"Of course, he has to get into Yuuei first."
7759693,2,246,"His thoughts are interrupted when he notices what appears to be their instructor."
7759693,2,247,"A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage, swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times. He glances at some papers laid out in front of him, then looks up at the crowd of students ahead. He uses one hand to slick his pointy yellow hair back, and the other to read whatever is written on his notes."
7759693,2,248,"When he’s done, he looks up, smiles, and then shouts."
7759693,2,249,"“HOW’S IT GOIN’, PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS?”"
7759693,2,250,"The students all slam their hands over their ears, the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud."
7759693,2,251,"The man glances at someone at the back of the stage, pulling his mouth away from the mic."
7759693,2,252,"“What--you want me to?” He gestures at the mic, then at himself. More gesticulating, then a look of understanding. “ Oh , you want me to not use the mic? Okay, that’s cool. That’s fair.”"
7759693,2,253,"He steps away from the podium, then starts again."
7759693,2,254,"“Sorry for that. Good morning, examinees! I hope you’re ready to TEST!”"
7759693,2,255,"Midoriya gasps with recognition, clapping a hand over his mouth."
7759693,2,256,"“That’s--that’s Yamada Hizashi! Present Mic!” he whispers excitedly. “Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the--”"
7759693,2,257,"“Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention, dipshit,” Bakugou growls. Midoriya shuts up instantly, but a smile still tugs at the corners of his mouth."
7759693,2,258,"“Let’s get right to it! As you all know, Yuuei is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting’s active use in careers,” Yamada says, gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2. He, in turn, raises two fingers. “That’s why we’ll be testing you on two different aspects: power and combat.”"
7759693,2,259,"#1 , the jumbotron reads. Power."
7759693,2,260,"“First, we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending,” Yamada explains. “We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you. Airbenders will go for speed, firebenders for distance and heat, waterbenders for distance, and earthbenders for height.”"
7759693,2,261,"Midoriya looks down at the table in front of him. Yeah, he’s been working on his power output through his sessions with All Might, but he isn’t sure how that will stack up against the other benders here. He’ll just have to do his best."
7759693,2,262,"“Remember: power comes from many different sources in bending,” Yamada says, almost as a side-note. “There’s sheer power, there’s technical power--we don’t care whichever one you use, as long as your output is good.”"
7759693,2,263,"#2: Combat."
7759693,2,264,"“And here’s the fun part--the combat,” the man says with a devious grin. Midoriya gulps."
7759693,2,265,"“We have multiple bending rings set up, each with their own stationed team,” Yamada says, waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him. “We’ve assigned you into teams of four. Your task is simple: beat the other team.”"
7759693,2,266,"A murmur goes across the room, students glancing at one another."
7759693,2,267,"“Now, just beating the other team isn’t gonna be enough to pass, of course. We’re grading you on a multitude of other things. But I’ll tell you this: the more hits you get on the other team, the better. You don’t want to be a bystander for this test.”"
7759693,2,268,"“You’ll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight,” Yamada says. “But for now: go show us some power!”"
7759693,2,269,"His following wink rallies the students; there’s a burst in noise from the crowd, with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first."
7759693,2,270,"Midoriya follows hesitantly behind them, the reality of his competition now dawning on him."
7759693,2,271,"x"
7759693,2,272,"They’re broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites. He and Bakugou are separated (thank god), and he doesn’t bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field--he doesn’t think his stomach could take it."
7759693,2,273,"It’s a typical green field, but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone. The students amass right on the line."
7759693,2,274,"He edges his way to the front of the crowd, opting to fight his nervousness by observing other students’ tests. As he waits for the test to begin, someone chimes right next to him."
7759693,2,275,"“You made it!”"
7759693,2,276,"Midoriya looks to his left to see his savior from earlier: the airbending girl. Somehow, they ended up in the same testing group--Midoriya isn’t sure whether he’s happy or sad about that. He fidgets."
7759693,2,277,"“U-uh. Yep…”"
7759693,2,278,"She looks a little more serious from earlier, the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes. She must be nervous, too."
7759693,2,279,"“Well, good luck!” Without another word, she goes back to watching the field."
7759693,2,280,"Midoriya is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk--he would puke."
7759693,2,281,"The proctor makes his way into the testing zone, scanning a clipboard. “All right,” he begins. “First, students here based on recommendation. Line up.”"
7759693,2,282,"A group of six students step forward, their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band."
7759693,2,283,"They represent all four elements, but they all have an air of confidence around themselves--majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school, whether it be due to money, ability, or both."
7759693,2,284,"Whereas Midoriya had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else, these people are already leagues ahead of him."
7759693,2,285,"Their following displays are appropriately fantastic: a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds, some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high."
7759693,2,286,"But the test that catches everyone’s attention is a boy with strange white and red hair."
7759693,2,287,"As he takes to the field, something about him seems familiar--his hair? The dignity he carries himself with? Midoriya can’t see his face, but he knows he’s seen this kid before."
7759693,2,288,"The examinee seems to have tuned the rest of the world out. As soon as he’s given the go ahead, he swirls his arms in a loose circle, wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing."
7759693,2,289,"Midoriya can't help but be entranced by the display; they're the moves of an experienced waterbender, but something looks off--instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending, the motions look borderline angry, fast and sometimes even jagged."
7759693,2,290,"The boy’s palms spark."
7759693,2,291,"With a sharp jump and thrust, a jet of flames erupts from his hands, leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long."
7759693,2,292,"Midoriya flinches."
7759693,2,293,"His eyes finally drift down to the boy’s armband: red. Fire Nation. But what kind of bending was that? It was more waterbending than firebending--and in a test where you’re try to maximize power output, you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique."
7759693,2,294,"The boy looks unfazed, merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression. It’s not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together."
7759693,2,295,"A scar. Strangely colored hair. Calm, removed. Firebending that looks like waterbending."
7759693,2,296,"That’s…."
7759693,2,297,"That’s…."
7759693,2,298,"“Hey, um,” the airbender girl says from beside him. “You’re kind of staring. At Todoroki Shouto. Y’know. The Firelord’s son . The one that hates staring .”"
7759693,2,299,"At the sound of his name, the prince turns and locks eyes with him. Midoriya snaps out of his trance, jerking to attention and whipping his head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off."
7759693,2,300,"“W-was I?” he nervously asks, eyes jumping across the backs of other testers, at the buildings--anywhere but Todoroki. “Haha, oops…”"
7759693,2,301,"The girl starts laughing, to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful, and she ought to be ashamed, and if she aims to be a top bender, she should be paying extremely close attention, and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out. When he gages it’s been long enough, he shyly peeks at the prince again."
7759693,2,302,"Todoroki’s mismatched eyes are still trained on him, the quiet intensity of his gaze making Midoriya fidget. It feels like he’s being analyzed--like this boy is sinking under his skin and paging through his weaknesses and secrets."
7759693,2,303,"It’s scary."
7759693,2,304,"The prince finally looks away and Midoriya releases a breath he didn’t know he was holding."
7759693,2,305,"“Can I go?” Todoroki asks, turning to the test proctor. “I’ve done my required testing.”"
7759693,2,306,"“I’m afraid not, Your Highness,” the proctor says. “You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam. I’m sorry for all the formalities, but--well, rules are rules.”"
7759693,2,307,"Todoroki sighs, then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd. He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line, a buzzcut-headed airbender, but doesn’t apologize and keeps moving. The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test."
7759693,2,308,"The prince looks robotic. Icy. Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord’s son."
7759693,2,309,"What happened to him? What must his home life be like, to make him that cold?"
7759693,2,310,"But Midoriya is brought back to his current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field, ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes. Oh, right. He has to go up against that ."
7759693,2,311,"He twitches in place as the proctor tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd."
7759693,2,312,"“That concludes the recommendee testing,” the proctor says. “Now we’ll move on to standard testing--and I must remind recommendees that they’re to stay put for this portion, as well.” He glances at Todoroki, who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd."
7759693,2,313,"“Everyone, please section off into your respective elements.”"
7759693,2,314,"With a shy smile, he and the airbending girls part ways. The proctor announces the order of elements: water, earth, fire, air."
7759693,2,315,"The following displays aren’t as intimidating as the recommendees’, but they still put Midoriya on edge. The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies, nonchalantly blasting streams across the field."
7759693,2,316,"When they move onto earthbending, Midoriya starts feeling intimidated."
7759693,2,317,"Yes, Midoriya has put on weight and packed on muscle. But he’s still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders. Sculpted calves, broad backs, and flat pecs--Midoriya feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for."
7759693,2,318,"But All Might’s advice comes to mind."
7759693,2,319,"Midoriya, there’s a misconception about earthbending that you’re fixated on, he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move."
7759693,2,320,"Know this: muscle mass does not equate to power."
7759693,2,321,"No, power in bending comes from the strength of your own internal energy--your body must be able to hold that power, of course, but your main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you push it into the elements."
7759693,2,322,"Midoriya breathes deeply. Focus on himself. Focus on doing the move right. He almost doesn’t notice the test in front of him has finished."
7759693,2,323,"The proctor pauses for a moment before reading the next name."
7759693,2,324,"“Midoriya Izuku.”"
7759693,2,325,"He jumps at the sound of his name, then begins to edge his way through the crowd with slumped shoulders."
7759693,2,326,"The prolonged look the proctor gives him feels too significant to ignore--does he knows? Does everyone in Yuuei know? He swallows hard, then assumes his power stance."
7759693,2,327,"Midoriya gazes down at his hands, trying to calm his heartbeat and praying he’s not about to do something that isn’t earthbending."
7759693,2,328,"“Whenever you’re ready, Midoriya,” the proctor says, making the boy flinch."
7759693,2,329,"Okay, Midoriya: remember your training. You worked with All Might on this--you should have this in the bag. He shifts, steadying his feet and shifting his weight into his heels. This is the easy part."
7759693,2,330,"A deep breath."
7759693,2,331,"Then he begins."
7759693,2,332,"The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending--in a slow and deliberate movement, Midoriya moves his arms upwards from his core and out in a circle. His hands meet at the top; he calmly lowers them, clasped over his heart."
7759693,2,333,"Draw power from your core, he hears All Might say. Bring your heart’s energy into your hands, then out through your feet and into the ground."
7759693,2,334,"Midoriya imagines that energy transfer, sees his power bleed out of his chest and into his hands."
7759693,2,335,"Down and steady, my boy."
7759693,2,336,"His hands move lower towards the ground, dragging the energy into the earth below."
7759693,2,337,"And… Now!"
7759693,2,338,"Midoriya thrusts his hands skyward in a singular decisive movement, the ground following the motion. He holds it, waits for the rumbling above to halt. And then he breaks stance, oddly drained after the display."
7759693,2,339,"He cranes his head upwards, panting. It rivals the earthbending he’s seen thus far--it might even be higher."
7759693,2,340,"But the important thing is that he actually did it."
7759693,2,341,"He actually correctly did the move All Might taught him."
7759693,2,342,"He exits the bending zone with a small smile on his face, bubbling with internal pride. It makes him feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam--at least he performed well on one half of the practical. He settles into the crowd, content to silently watch the next bending feats."
7759693,2,343,"“Hey.”"
7759693,2,344,"It’s a hollow voice, cool and controlled. Midoriya turns to look at the speaker, ready to greet them in turn."
7759693,2,345,"He flinches when he sees it’s none other than the Fire Nation Prince, Todoroki Shouto."
7759693,2,346,"(Is he supposed to bow? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his shoes? Oh god what is he supposed to do.)"
7759693,2,347,"Midoriya instead opts to blink at the other boy, lost for words. Todoroki must be used to awed silence--he speaks in Midoriya’s stead."
7759693,2,348,"“That was an All Might specialty move,” the prince states, unwavering."
7759693,2,349,"“Um. Y-yes?” Midoriya says."
7759693,2,350,"Todoroki does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya mentally slaps himself for forgetting."
7759693,2,351,"“Oh god, I mean--yes, Your Highness,” Midoriya backtracks, face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty. “I admired--”"
7759693,2,352,"“Don’t call me that,” Todoroki objects. “Please. I can’t stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father.”"
7759693,2,353,"Midoriya reels at the nonchalant insult--of course, there were rumors that the heir didn’t get along with the Firelord, but to be so open about it…."
7759693,2,354,"Todoroki Shouto must truly not care about family image."
7759693,2,355,"“Okay…. Todoroki,” Midoriya stammers. “But, um, yes, I admired All Might a lot as a kid, and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches.”"
7759693,2,356,"“That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output,” Todoroki says without missing a beat. “It’s supposed to take years to master--they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself.”"
7759693,2,357,"Is it hot out here? Or is it just Midoriya? God, it’s boiling."
7759693,2,358,"Haha, I’m so dead."
7759693,2,359,"“I. Well. Hm,” Midoriya stammers, pulling at his collar and cringing under Todoroki’s steady gaze. “I guess... I’m just a quick learner?”"
7759693,2,360,"Todoroki doesn’t move and Midoriya’s eyes flick around the surrounding crowd, desperately avoiding eye contact. The sensation of his skin being peeled back by the prince’s gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his skin being flayed . It takes all of his willpower to avoid scampering off."
7759693,2,361,"“...Sure,” Todoroki says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced. He scans Midoriya one more time, then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd."
7759693,2,362,"Midoriya resists the urge to start hyperventilating."
7759693,2,363,"He gets the sense that he just had a very close call, even though there’s no way in hell that Todoroki could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him. It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover--that, and Midoriya’s horrendous ability to keep secrets."
7759693,2,364,"If he actually gets into Yuuei, he’ll have to watch himself around the heir."
7759693,2,365,"He watches the rest of the examinees in a daze. It’s one amazing performance after the next--they blend together in his mind and he finds himself both intimidated and inspired."
7759693,2,366,"This is what he could be if he gets into Yuuei."
7759693,2,367,"This is the power he could practice beside, the people he could befriend."
7759693,2,368,"(He tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched, suspicious eyes attached to his back.)"
7759693,2,369,"When the final test is complete, the proctor calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside--further instructions will be provided there."
7759693,2,370,"Midoriya leaves the field, a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his stomach."
7759693,2,371,"x"
7759693,2,372,"When he finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms, it’s simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true."
7759693,2,373,"He stands in front of the strewn out clothes, knowing he needs to dress fast but taking his time regardless. How many times has he wanted to do this? To wear these uniforms, to fight in the pro-bending ring?"
7759693,2,374,"But he finds he can’t get any pleasure from it right now--the stakes are too high."
7759693,2,375,"The rules of the match echo through his head as he pulls off his own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants."
7759693,2,376,"“This won’t be your normal pro-bending match, with rounds and territory gains,” Yamada shares, seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom. He looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya’s future."
7759693,2,377,"“Instead, it’s one 5-minute round, with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back.”"
7759693,2,378,"The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive; Midoriya yanks them on and wishes he had asked for a size up. He’s grown more than he thought he had."
7759693,2,379,"“The bare minimum to pass is KO’ing the other team. Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make.”"
7759693,2,380,"He shrugs the thick padding on over his shoulders, yanks the green sash around his waist tighter, and deposits the helmet on his head. He exits the room, swerving a left and going to the entry hall."
7759693,2,381,"“You’ll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can, while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible.”"
7759693,2,382,"The lights of the arena are blinding; he squints as he stumbles his way into the ring. He pays no mind to his teammates, solely focused on calming himself down before the match."
7759693,2,383,"“If you fall out of the ring, you fail.”"
7759693,2,384,"He closes his eyes and inhales deeply. This is it."
7759693,2,385,"Some voice in the back of his head prompts him to wonder how Bakugou is faring in all of this--but considering this is Bakugou he’s thinking about, there’s no reason to be worried."
7759693,2,386,"He needs to focus on himself."
7759693,2,387,"“Hi again!”"
7759693,2,388,"Midoriya jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his thoughts, then flushes when he spots the speaker: pixie bob girl."
7759693,2,389,"“Looks like we’re on the same team, huh?” she notes, eyes skimming over Midoriya, then the other two team members behind him. “The other two don’t seem to be terribly friendly. The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him and the firebender was a little zoned out. I don’t think they’re into the whole teamwork thing, y’know?”"
7759693,2,390,"“Uh-huyeah,” Midoriya says, internally slapping himself for the mix of gibberish he can’t help but spew."
7759693,2,391,"Luckily, the girl doesn’t seem to mind. Maybe she’s used to it. “Oh well, I guess we’ll just have to watch each others’ backs. I’m Uraraka, by the way!”"
7759693,2,392,"Uraraka: bright, beautiful . How fitting."
7759693,2,393,"“M-Midoriya,” he replies."
7759693,2,394,"“Nice to meet ya, Midoriya!” She drops her helmet on her head, gives him a final smile and thumbs up, then paces ahead of him to the middle line."
7759693,2,395,"Well, at least that’s one advantage. Uraraka seems to be a pretty experienced bender--even if airbending isn’t terribly offensive, she’ll still cover for him."
7759693,2,396,"It’s a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless; he joins his team at the start point."
7759693,2,397,"The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears. Not that it matters--he already knows the rules by heart. Instead, he takes the time to focus himself, to peek glances at his opponents and teammates."
7759693,2,398,"The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated. He’s not sure if they’re Yuuei students or hired benders, but they’re older and hardened. They look sure of themselves and their bending, and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination."
7759693,2,399,"His team is… not quite so confident. Like Uraraka said, the firebender looks dazed and confused. The waterbender looks near murderous."
7759693,2,400,"But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka’s. Gone is her cheery disposition and airy smile; instead, all he sees is icy willpower. Her eyes pick apart the other team as well, dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces."
7759693,2,401,"This girl means business."
7759693,2,402,"Rather than put him at ease, it disorients him further--he’s not the only one desperate to get in here. Is sabotage an option in this match? What if she steals points from him?"
7759693,2,403,"Quit it, quit it, quit it! He scolds himself internally, too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand."
7759693,2,404,"There’s literally no logic in Uraraka trying to beat you! You’re on the same team, you both have to survive! Regardless, you’ll get enough points anyway, you’ve done the work and--"
7759693,2,405,"“--riya!”"
7759693,2,406,"He startles, whipping around to see Uraraka shouting at him."
7759693,2,407,"“They’re about to start!”"
7759693,2,408,"He stumbles into Zone 1 and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead. Midoriya looks upwards, pupils shrinking in shock."
7759693,2,409,"“...2, 1: GO.”"
7759693,2,410,"He doesn’t even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach, sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone 2. He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet, scanning the scene ahead."
7759693,2,411,"The match can only have been going on for ten seconds, but it’s already sheer chaos. The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles: his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender, their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks--she’s already in Zone 3, yikes--, and Uraraka is cartwheeling across Zone 1 to avoid fire blasts."
7759693,2,412,"Midoriya raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender, but then he realizes."
7759693,2,413,"Wait."
7759693,2,414,"....Where’s their waterbender?"
7759693,2,415,"The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach. He lands on his butt but then uses his ground contact to his advantage, shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk. The disk soars to his hands, which he then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes. The gaping hole in the middle means it doesn’t offer as much protection as he’d like, but it’s all that he’s got."
7759693,2,416,"The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train; he peeks from around the side of his blockade to see the waterbender, at the edge of his Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet."
7759693,2,417,"Okay--he has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted, then aim a disk at him to score a point. But how?"
7759693,2,418,"His eyes leap across the field, settling on the duel between his team’s waterbender and the enemy airbender. That fight is almost over--one more hit on the airbender and she’ll be off the back."
7759693,2,419,"Time for a risk."
7759693,2,420,"Midoriya waits for a water-free moment, then flings his shield as hard as possible at the airbender."
7759693,2,421,"It doesn’t connect, but it disorients her; taking advantage of the distraction, his team’s waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on. She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge."
7759693,2,422,"Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist."
7759693,2,423,"He gets pelted with water again--but with nothing free to block it, the force pushes him uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line. Gritting his teeth, he leans into the stream so he’s on his hands and knees."
7759693,2,424,"As soon as the water lets up, he leaps upright, stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground. He’ll have to make this fast."
7759693,2,425,"He keeps up the disk’s momentum with his arms, flinging the rock and his energy directly at the waterbender, poised for a direct hit and his first point--"
7759693,2,426,"Water makes it to the enemy first, slamming into him and pushing him into Zone 2. Midoriya’s disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring. Midoriya drops his arms and cranes his head to look at the water’s source."
7759693,2,427,"His teammate, wheeling his arms and prepping another water blast, doesn’t even look at him as he shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring. So much for teamwork."
7759693,2,428,"(They only have two enemies left now, but Midoriya finds he can’t be happy about it.)"
7759693,2,429,"A glance at the clock: 2 minutes left."
7759693,2,430,"Holy crap, only two minutes left already? He still doesn’t have any points! Who’s even left to hit?"
7759693,2,431,"Their firebender must have been knocked out--she’s nowhere to be seen. But the odds are still in their favor: three versus two."
7759693,2,432,"Uraraka is now engaged with the earthbender--she’s struggling, but she’s staying put in Zone 1. The firebender stands in the middle of Zone 2, looking to pick a fight."
7759693,2,433,"Okay, there’s Midoriya’s target."
7759693,2,434,"The firebender, however, notices him first: she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him. He’s forced to roll to the side. He pushes onto his feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming."
7759693,2,435,"He’s only done defense so far--but what else can he do? How can he fight when the enemy won’t even let him plant himself and utilize his bending?"
7759693,2,436,"Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka’s fight, he has no choice but to turn around and backtrack--he’s going to get hit."
7759693,2,437,"Unless he gets a distraction…."
7759693,2,438,"“Uraraka!” Midoriya shouts, praying that she’ll be able to spare a moment. “Some air, please!”"
7759693,2,439,"She jerks at her name, looking towards Midoriya and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent. Her gaze jumps over his fight, and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes. She nods."
7759693,2,440,"Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle, she inhales deeply and holds."
7759693,2,441,"Midoriya shifts his core to head back in the direction he came from."
7759693,2,442,"Uraraka exhales and hell breaks loose."
7759693,2,443,"Something resembling a tornado erupts from her, spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex. Eyes wide under her helmet, the opponent runs into Zone 3 to dodge it."
7759693,2,444,"Now! Now Midoriya can go for the hit. He plants himself, raising a disk."
7759693,2,445,"But before he can even aim it, the wind catches up to the firebender. She soars upwards, then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado."
7759693,2,446,"Midoriya stares, desperation clawing at his core."
7759693,2,447,"“One hit!” he cries in frustration. “I just need one hit! ”"
7759693,2,448,"He looks dully at the scene ahead--there’s just one more person to score hits on, and Uraraka seems to have that fight on lock. Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him again, if he’s still here."
7759693,2,449,"Turning around, however, the waterbender is nowhere to be found. It looks like it’s just him and Uraraka. But she’s more than capable--if he tried to interfere, he’d probably just mess her up."
7759693,2,450,"There’s a dull thud and someone yelps. Midoriya whips around to see Uraraka pinned under an earth disk, the opposing team’s earthbender stalking over. He gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his captive, the sharp motion making her wheeze."
7759693,2,451,"Midoriya’s eyes flit over to the clock: 30 seconds. 30 seconds until they win."
7759693,2,452,"However, if Uraraka gets knocked out of the ring and it’s just him and this other guy left… Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker."
7759693,2,453,"Which, yes, is an opportunity for actual points, if Midoriya wins."
7759693,2,454,"But it also means that Uraraka fails."
7759693,2,455,"Midoriya thrusts his hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground. He repeats the motion again, and again, and again until he has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him. He grunts under the strain, legs screaming in protest, but he manages to stay upright."
7759693,2,456,"Meanwhile, the enemy is in position, arms pushing out from his body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka’s rock coffin hurtling towards the edge--"
7759693,2,457,"With a guttural yell, Midoriya slams both his fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent. The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him, rocketing him away from Uraraka and towards the opposite edge."
7759693,2,458,"The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya’s arms and he swears he can feel them fracture in at least five different places."
7759693,2,459,"His arms become pure, unadulterated pain."
7759693,2,460,"He collapses."
7759693,2,461,"Everything seems hazy as he watches his missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust, watches the enemy emerge dirty but unscathed. The man lifts his hands and Midoriya feels a disk slide under him and two disks rise to box him in on both sides, sending a new wave of searing heat through his arms."
7759693,2,462,"He can’t move."
7759693,2,463,"His surroundings are shifting; he’s speeding towards the edge and he’s accepted that there’s nothing he can do, that his exam is over ."
7759693,2,464,"He clears the side and hangs in the great open space, right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below--"
7759693,2,465,"But gravity never kicks in."
7759693,2,466,"He simply floats there, 20 feet above failure. And then he realizes."
7759693,2,467,"He lolls his head to the side and spots Uraraka, lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him up. The earthbender is nowhere to be seen."
7759693,2,468,"She adds her left arm to the movement, circling her hands over each other and towards herself, and Midoriya feels himself begin to drift back."
7759693,2,469,"When the ground is finally below him, Uraraka stops bending. Midoriya drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact. His eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes--"
7759693,2,470,"“Aaaaaand your exam is over! ” Yamada yells over the intercom."
7759693,2,471,"Midoriya blinks."
7759693,2,472,"All that training. All that work. And:"
7759693,2,473,"“ I got one hit. Just one hit, ” Midoriya moans, dropping his head to the ground. “What kind of a bender am I…”"
7759693,2,474,"There’s something wet on his cheek and he closes his eyes, trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his arms. It seeps into his brain, clouding his thoughts, and he fights to stay awake."
7759693,2,475,"“...him to the healers, now!”"
7759693,2,476,"One hit."
7759693,2,477,"“...what was that stunt…”"
7759693,2,478,"One hit."
7759693,2,479,"“...sure she’s okay, get her a bag….”"
7759693,2,480,"One hit."
7759693,2,481,"The acrid smell of vomit reaches his nose and everything is overwhelming--the noises are overwhelming and his thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming."
7759693,2,482,"“...he’s repeating one hit, why….”"
7759693,2,483,"I failed."
7759693,2,484,"His brain flickers off."
7759693,2,485,"He doesn’t eat much those next few days."
7759693,2,486,"His arms are healed, layers of bandages and worried looks from his mother the only evidence that anything happened."
7759693,2,487,"But the events of the exam plague his mind, looping over and over as he tries to settle back into normalcy, as he tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next."
7759693,2,488,"He’s not going to Yuuei. That much seems obvious."
7759693,2,489,"Sure, he stayed in the ring—but no way that was enough to get him into the school, not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds."
7759693,2,490,"Bakugou got in—Midoriya doesn’t have to speculate on that. He’s dreading seeing the smug look on his face in class the day after they find out, feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time."
7759693,2,491,"Maybe Uraraka got in. Maybe she’ll remember that silly earthbending kid that couldn’t even score a hit, take pity and call to hang out sometime. Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam."
7759693,2,492,"He sits on the couch, squeezing a weight in his fist and evaluating other schools to look into, other masters he can learn from."
7759693,2,493,"But it feels wrong—it feels like he should be following in All Might’s steps and learning at Yuuei."
7759693,2,494,"How is he supposed to be great if he isn’t learning from the greats? What important friendships would he have made with the four nation’s up and coming leaders—like the Fire Nation heir? How much easier would the path ahead have been, had he made those connections early?"
7759693,2,495,"Midoriya thinks of Todoroki’s empty, calculating eyes and shudders."
7759693,2,496,"True, the prince didn’t seem so easy to befriend. But being classmates at Yuuei would have been a good start."
7759693,2,497,"Midoriya is trapped in a cycle of misery—thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be. His mother, the saint that she is, has allowed him to mope for the week, only prompting him to eat and go to school. But otherwise, she’s let him be. She saw it coming and understands that he needs time to come to terms."
7759693,2,498,"He doesn’t respond when his mom announces she’s going downstairs to grab the mail. But when he hears the thud of feet running up the stairs, he knows."
7759693,2,499,"“I-Izuku!” His mom cries, crashing into the living room and presenting him a simple envelope. The Yuuei seal glistens on the front. “It’s here!”"
7759693,2,500,"Midoriya simply stares at the black lettering for a moment."
7759693,2,501,"Then he silently rises from the couch, taking the letter from her hand and walking to his room. The door closes behind him with a resolute click and he takes a deep breath."
7759693,2,502,"Welp, this is it."
7759693,2,503,"Here is the confirmation that he needs a new plan."
7759693,2,504,"He sits at his desk, fingers hesitating at the seal. But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his fears and he rips it open, pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out. He hungrily begins to read."
7759693,2,505,"“Midoriya Izuku,” it begins, not sparing even a moment for pleasantries. “The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy.”"
7759693,2,506,"Below the sentence is a chart. Column one: Written Exam. Column two: Power output. Column three: Combat score."
7759693,2,507,"The written exam is what he expected: he passed. Not with flying colors, but with a sizeable margin."
7759693,2,508,"The power score is actually better than he expected. 27 feet, a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score."
7759693,2,509,"But the combat column is where he trembles. The “1” draws his eyes in like a magnet, confirming his fears."
7759693,2,510,"He didn’t score nearly high enough to get in."
7759693,2,511,"He’s toast."
7759693,2,512,"Resigned, he lets his eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart."
7759693,2,513,"“Welcome to Yuuei.”"
7759693,2,514,"His eyes skim over the words, then he double-takes. He backtracks and reads it again."
7759693,2,515,"It stays the same: “Welcome to Yuuei.”"
7759693,2,516,"This has to be some sort of mistake. He has to call them, to tell them they sent him the wrong letter."
7759693,2,517,"He skims the sentences below that, trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for. The special observations section catches his eye."
7759693,2,518,"“Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration.”"
7759693,2,519,"Uraraka--it has to be Uraraka. She wanted to share points with me?"
7759693,2,520,"“While lacking in the hits category in combat, you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test. Your teachers will work with you on your offense, but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs.”"
7759693,2,521,"...Teamwork and cooperation?"
7759693,2,522,"His gaze leaps back up to the chart, honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand: rescue points. The whopping “59” under it sharply contrasts the “1” in the hits category."
7759693,2,523,"It’s not a mistake."
7759693,2,524,"He…"
7759693,2,525,"He actually got into Yuuei."
7759693,2,526,"A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink, but Midoriya finds that he doesn’t care. It’s not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in."
7759693,2,527,"Of course his first instinct is to tell All Might."
7759693,2,528,"The former avatar probably already knows, what with their  spiritual connection and his worldly contacts. But Midoriya wants to tell him in person regardless, to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed."
7759693,2,529,"He’ll admit--All Might doesn’t seem so godlike anymore. If anything, he’s a source of comfort, a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya lacks in the waking world."
7759693,2,530,"(Maybe All Might is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family.)"
7759693,2,531,"When Midoriya clambers into bed that night, he knows what to do. With his headphones playing a soft song for him, he lays flat on his back, gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling, and closes his eyes."
7759693,2,532,"He forces his heart to slow, makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears. Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed."
7759693,2,533,"The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum--the thrumming of the cosmos, of energy and space. He latches on, sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown."
7759693,2,534,"When he opens his eyes again, he’s not in his familiar forest."
7759693,2,535,"It's the Spirit World--that much Midoriya can tell--, but it's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he's grown to know."
7759693,2,536,"The landscape is best described as a desert--but rather than sand, it's covered in dust. A barren horizon: no plants, no buildings, no people. Everything looks gray and dead. The air is dry and scratchy, and every breath feels like an assault on his throat."
7759693,2,537,"Midoriya crouches to the ground, sifting a handful of the material through his fingers. It feels wrong. Something twinges in his chest and he can’t say why, but something in the dust feels… alive? Tormented?"
7759693,2,538,"Is there someone buried here? Was this dust formerly someone ?"
7759693,2,539,"He begins to dig in haste--looking for what, he doesn't know. But if someone is in trouble, if someone is in pain, he has to help , he can't just leave them--"
7759693,2,540,"His hand brushes something solid and he halts for a moment. Then he starts again in earnest, frantically clawing at the dust. The thing begins to surface and, to his horror, he realizes that it's a hand."
7759693,2,541,"He falls backwards on his butt, scooching away from the object. But it's too late--the hand shifts, free from its confinement, and spiders its way out of its dusty prison."
7759693,2,542,"Several things happen at once."
7759693,2,543,"The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy. Dust takes to the air, pelting Midoriya in sheets, invading his clothes, his eyes, his throat. He chokes--more accurately, he drowns."
7759693,2,544,"The hand closes the gap, crawling over his foot and clamping onto his ankle. He wastes air and yelps, flailing his leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off. But his energy wanes; he sinks, head hitting the ground. He can only watch the thing with his eyes, unable to escape."
7759693,2,545,"It might just be oxygen deprivation--but Midoriya’s blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body."
7759693,2,546,"The mass climbs its way up his unmoving torso, crushing the remaining air in him even faster than before. Its rough head settles right over Midoriya’s. He tries to jerk his face away but finds that he can't."
7759693,2,547,"I know what you are, the words come, snake-like and tired and cold."
7759693,2,548,"Midoriya’s eyes widen; he reaches at his last scraps of energy and renews his efforts to pull away. Instead, a dusty hand clamps down over his throat. He lets out a weak wheeze of agony."
7759693,2,549,"The thing leans in, almost brushing Midoriya’s nose. And then it laughs--a nasally wheezing noise, a sad mockery of actual laughter. It sends a chill down Midoriya’s spine."
7759693,2,550,"It belts out one more raspy chuckle. If it had a mouth, Midoriya imagines it would be smiling."
7759693,2,551,"You think you’re safe? That the world is safe? it questions, a note of cruelty tinting its voice."
7759693,2,552,"Midoriya’s head lulls, his eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his body."
7759693,2,553,"How naive."
7759693,2,554,"His eyes are closed and he’s barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear."
7759693,2,555,"You obviously have no idea what's coming."
7759693,2,556,"Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya’s armpits, yanking him under the mound of dust and into the earth. He swallows dust and sees no more."
7759693,2,557,"x"
7759693,2,558,"A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya’s throat as he bolts upright."
7759693,2,559,"Escape."
7759693,2,560,"He has to escape."
7759693,2,561,"There's something confining his legs--"
7759693,2,562,"He kicks his way out from under his sheets, stumbling from his bed and tripping onto the floor."
7759693,2,563,"The soft carpeting of his room. Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows. Rectangles of bending idols watching over him from the walls."
7759693,2,564,"He's in the real world."
7759693,2,565,"He's safe."
7759693,2,566,"Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his mother rips open the door, hair ruffled and terror on her face."
7759693,2,567,"“Izuku! What happened?”"
7759693,2,568,"Midoriya can't help it. A tiny sob fights its way out of his chest, then another."
7759693,2,569,"He's cried in front of his mom before. This isn’t new."
7759693,2,570,"But it feels different--it’s embarrassing. He’s supposed to hold up the whole world but he can’t even hold himself together."
7759693,2,571,"He drops his face in his hands."
7759693,2,572,"His mom pauses in the doorway, assessing the scene. Then, no questions asked, she glides over and sinks to the floor, wrapping her arms around him in a comforting embrace."
7759693,2,573,"“There there, Izuku,” she murmurs, a hand rubbing up and down his back. “It'll all be okay. You'll be fine.”"
7759693,2,574,"But it won't. And he won't."
7759693,2,575,"How is he supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that?"
7759693,2,576,"How is he supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there?"
7759693,2,577,"What is that thing? What is it plotting?"
7759693,2,578,"How is he supposed to stop it?"
7759693,2,579,"In an instant, the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his back and he collapses under it, clinging to his mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that:"
7759693,2,580,"A boy."
