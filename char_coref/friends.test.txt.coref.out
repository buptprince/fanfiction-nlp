The band starts to play , and the recessional starts . Ross ($_ross) tries to take Emily_'s ($_emily) hand , but she ($_emily) snatches it away from him ($_ross) . `` Well , that went well , '' Joey ($_joey) says sarcastically standing by Chandler ($_chandler) , `` Yeah . ''`` It could 've been worse , he ($_richard) could 've shot her ($_emily) , '' Chandler ($_chandler) replied sarcastically as Joey sighs.Ross and Emily ($_emily) make it to the lobby.Ross and Emily ($_emily) are in the bathroom and Emily ($_emily) is yelling at him ($_richard) . Rachel , Chandler ($_chandler) , Joey ($_joey) , Monica ($_monica) and Richard ($_richard) are standing outside the doorway . `` You 've spoiled everything ! It 's like a nightmare ! '' Emily ($_emily) yelled from inside the bathroom with Ross ($_ross) . `` My ($_emily) friends and family are out there ! How can I ($_emily) face them ?! How can you do this to me ($_emily) ?! ''`` Hey , no matter what happens with Ross and Emily ($_emily) , we still get cake right ? '' Joey ($_joey) asked quietly to the gang who gave him ($_joey) dirty looks and glares.Ross exits the bathroom . `` That-that-that 's all right , no honey , you take your time sweetie , '' Ross ($_ross) answered , freaked out and unable to think about how to fix this mess . `` I ($_ross) 'll be right out here . '' Emily ($_emily) slams the door in his face , absolutely furious . `` She ($_emily) 's just fixing her ($_emily) makeup . ''`` I ($_emily) hate you ($_emily) ! '' Emily ($_emily) screamed in both anger and devastation . `` And , I love you ($_emily) ! '' Ross ($_ross) called back trying to lighten the tension with his ($_ross) wife.The gang are giving him ($_ross) sympathetic looks feeling awful for Ross.Later on at the wedding reception , Chandler ($_chandler) looks around and slowly walks up beside Joey ($_joey) , trying to act casual so no one would catch on and question them . `` Hey , '' Chandler ($_chandler) says quietly , glancing around the room to make sure no one is looking at them . `` Hey , '' Joey_answered_,_grabbing_some_food_and ($_some) put it on his ($_some) plate . `` Oh wow , I ($_chandler) hope you do n't take this the wrong way but , I ($_chandler) know we had plans to meet up tonight and ... '' Chandler ($_chandler) begins to explain to Joey . He ($_chandler) really did n't want to cancel tonight , but his ($_chandler) friendship with Joey ($_joey) means more to him ($_chandler) , and did n't want to lose that . `` Ugh ($_ugh) , I ($_joey) 'm just kinda worried about what it ($_ugh) might do to our friendship . ''`` I ($_joey) know , '' Joey ($_joey) agrees , still looking forward , trying not to attract attention . `` How could we have let this happen ? ''`` Ten times ! ''`` Ugh ! Well , y’ know , we were away ... '' Joey ($_joey) says but Chandler ($_chandler) interrupts him ($_joey) . `` In a foreign country ... '' Chandler ($_chandler) finished , sounding disappointed . `` I ($_joey) blame London ($_london) , '' Joey ($_joey) said taking more food , not realizing he ($_joey) is over filling his ($_joey) plate . `` Bad London ($_london) ! '' Chandler ($_chandler) said sarcastically . He ($_chandler) takes a spoon and smacks the turkey . `` So look umm , while we 're st-still in London ($_london) , I mean ... '' Joey ($_joey) starts after some long minutes of awkward silence . He ($_chandler) kept his ($_chandler) voice down and gave him ($_chandler) a sexy smirk which he ($_chandler) knows that Chandler ($_chandler) ca n't resist . `` We can keep doing it right ? '' Chandler ($_chandler) tried to avoid that sexy smirk and his ($_chandler) face lightly turns into a shade of pink , casually looking down at his ($_chandler) feet , `` Well , I ($_chandler) do n't see that we have a choice . But , when we 're back home , we do n't do it . ''`` Only here , '' Joey ($_joey) agrees with a nod . `` Y’ know , I ($_joey) saw a wine cellar downstairs ... '' Chandler ($_chandler) starts blushing even more ; his ($_chandler) face turning into a light shade of red . `` I ($_joey) 'll meet you there in two minutes , '' Joey ($_joey) instantly responded putting his ($_joey) food down . He ($_joey) grabbed a chicken wing and shoved it in his ($_joey) mouth . `` K ! '' He ($_joey) throws down his ($_joey) plate and runs to the wine cellar , and Joey ($_joey) is about to follow him ($_joey) but realizes he ($_joey) needs some lotion or a condom . He ($_joey) runs into the next room quickly to try and find something.Richard and Monica ($_monica) are standing together talking with their plates of food . Rachel ($_rachel) walks up to them . `` Mon , honey , I ($_rachel) got ta ask you something , '' Rachel ($_rachel) said and glanced up at Richard ($_richard) . `` You too , Richard ($_richard) . Ross ($_ross) said my ($_ross) name up there , I ($_ross) mean , come on , I ($_ross) just ca n't pretend that did n't happen can I ($_ross) ? ''`` Honey , I ($_ross) do n't think that meant anything , '' Monica ($_monica) admitted . `` He would n't have said my ($_rachel) name if he did n't love me ($_rachel) , '' Rachel ($_rachel) protested as Monica ($_monica) and Richard ($_richard) glanced at each other . `` Guys , what should I ($_rachel) do ? ''`` Nothing , '' Monica ($_monica) said . “What?” Rachel ($_rachel) asked confused about why Monica ($_monica) told her ($_rachel) not to do anything . `` I ($_rachel) think I ($_rachel) 'm just gon na talk to Ross about what he think it meant . '' Rachel ($_rachel) tried to walk away but Monica ($_monica) grabbed her ($_rachel) arm and pulled her ($_rachel) back . `` Rachel ($_rachel) , no , he 's married , '' Monica ($_monica) said firmly , but yet softly . `` He 's married now , '' Richard ($_richard) added in as Rachel ($_rachel) looked up at him . `` If you do n't realize that , we ca n't help you . ''`` You have to let him go , Rach , '' Monica ($_monica) said with her ($_monica) voice cracking a bit . `` It 's too late . You need to move on . ''`` Okay , you 're right , '' Rachel ($_rachel) said holding back her ($_rachel) tears as Monica ($_monica) rubbed her ($_rachel) arm . `` You 're both right . You guys ca n't help me ($_rachel) . '' Rachel ($_rachel) marched away feeling a tear trickle down her ($_rachel) cheek.Joey is running up to Chandler who emerges from the wine cellar . He has a condom in his hand and shoves it in his pocket . `` We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar , why are you back ? '' Joey ($_joey) asked impatiently tapping is foot.Chandler takes a deep breath , `` Forget it , that 's off . ''`` Why ?! '' Joey ($_joey) asked frustrated.Mr . Waltham walks into the room from the wine cellar completely drunk and wasted . `` The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes ... '' He ($_joey) stuttered drunk before stumbling off . Joey ($_joey) and Chandler ($_chandler) look at each other and groaned . Joey ($_joey) grabs a piece of chicken and starts eating it instead . `` Joey , what are you ($_joey) doing ? '' Monica ($_monica) asked walking over to the boys while Richard ($_richard) is talking to her ($_monica) parents . `` You ($_monica) promised Phoebe you ($_monica) would n't eat meat until she ($_monica) has the babies ! ''`` Well um , I ($_joey) uh ... '' Joey ($_joey) said almost at a loss for words , beginning to panic . `` I ($_joey) figured we 're in another country , so it does n't count ! ''`` The man 's got a point ! '' Chandler chims in equally as panicked as Joey ($_joey) nodded , forcing a smile on his ($_joey) face . `` We are in a foreign ... romantic -- I-I mean , um , fun country ! I-It does n't count , Mon ! So , s-stop asking so many questions ! ''`` Ok ... '' Monica ($_monica) said bemused after a moment of awkward silence , and walked away.Ross and Rachel ($_rachel) meet up and talk about how saying `` Rachel ($_rachel) '' at the altar did n't mean a thing and in denial of their feelings . Joey ($_joey) finds them and approaches the discussion . `` Hey , the band 's ready outside for your first dance with Emily ($_emily) , so ... '' Joey ($_joey) said , feeling slightly awkward . “Oh! Oh-oh , the band 's ready ! Well , I-I-we got ta do what the band says ... '' Ross ($_ross) answers sarcastically then turns to a fit of anger . `` I ($_joey) do n't care about the stupid band ! ''`` You spit on me ($_joey) , man , '' Joey ($_joey) said annoyed , then wipes his ($_joey) face in disgust.Ross ' face softens , `` Look , I ($_joey) 'm sorry . '' `` Emily ($_emily) is kinda taking a long time , huh ? '' Joey ($_joey) replied , feeling sorry for Ross.Rachel forces herself to laugh , trying to throw in some humor to loosen the awkward tension between the three of them . `` Y’ know when I ($_joey) locked myself ($_joey) in the bathroom at my ($_joey) wedding , it was because I ($_joey) was trying to pop the window out of the frame . ''`` Oh , right ! '' Ross ($_ross) agrees with an awkward chuckle . `` Get the hell out of there , y’ know ? '' Rachel ($_rachel) continues with a smirk.They all start laughing , and quickly stop when they realize what she ($_rachel) just said and run over to the bathroom . Ross ($_ross) runs over to the bathroom in a panic attack , banging on the bathroom door . `` Emily ($_emily) ? Emily ($_emily) ? I ($_emily) 'm coming in ! '' Ross ($_ross) shouts , freaking out . He ($_ross) opens the door to reveal that the window is gone , along with Emily ($_emily) . `` Well , look at that , same thing , '' Rachel ($_rachel) says , surprised.Later on at the London Marriott , Joey ($_joey) and Chandler ($_chandler) are walking to their room . They are walking down the hallway until they reach their door . Joey ($_joey) grabs the key from his ($_joey) pocket . `` Listen , in the middle of everything if I ($_chandler) scream the word , `` Yippee ! '' just ignore me ($_chandler) , '' Chandler ($_chandler) explains as Joey ($_joey) rolls his ($_joey) eyes and chuckles . He ($_joey) opens the door to reveal Rachel ($_rachel) sitting on a bed . `` Oh my God , Rachel ($_rachel) ! '' Joey ($_joey) said surprised and starting to panic a bit , not really knowing what to say . “Hi! ''`` Oh , hello Rachel ($_rachel) , '' Chandler ($_chandler) says quietly , putting his ($_chandler) hands on Joey_'s ($_joey) shoulders , beginning to sweat . `` Ross ($_ross) said my ($_chandler) name . Okay? My ($_chandler) name ! '' Rachel ($_rachel) said frustrated , slapping her ($_rachel) hands on the bed and stood up . `` Ross ($_ross) said my ($_rachel) name up there that obviously means that he ($_ross) still loves me ($_rachel) ! '' The boys just stare at her ($_rachel) , dumbstruck . They are unable to think of anything to say at this point . But they do n't believe that Ross ($_ross) still loves her ($_rachel) . `` Okay , do n't believe me ($_rachel) , I ($_rachel) know I ($_rachel) 'm right , '' Rachel ($_rachel) finally said breaking the silence . `` Do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink ? ''`` Yes , we do , '' Chandler ($_chandler) said , struggling with words that Rachel ($_rachel) would believe . `` But , we have to change first . ''`` Yes , I ($_joey) want to change , '' Joey ($_joey) added in forcing a smile on his ($_joey) face . `` And why-why do n't you go down and get us a table ? ''`` Yeah , we 'll be down in like five minutes , '' Chandler ($_chandler) said before Joey ($_joey) got annoyed and elbows him ($_joey) really hard in the stomach . Chandler ($_chandler) moans in slight pain . `` Fifteen minutes , '' Joey ($_joey) said quickly through gritted teeth as Chandler ($_chandler) tried to hide his ($_chandler) red face . `` Okay , '' Rachel ($_rachel) said before the the phone rings and she ($_rachel) sits down and answers it . “Hello? Oh , Pheebs ($_pheebs) ! '' Rachel ($_rachel) said with excitement and faces the men . `` It 's Phoebe ! ''`` Oh , yay ... '' Chandler ($_chandler) said depressed but unnoticed by Rachel ($_rachel) . `` Great ... '' Joey ($_joey) finishes also depressed.Rachel starts to ramble on about how Ross ($_ross) fell in love with her ($_rachel) and how she ($_rachel) still thinks he ($_ross) loves her ($_rachel) . `` Okay , Pheebs ($_pheebs) , y’ know what , let 's look at this objectively all right ? Ninth grade , right ? The obsession starts . All right ? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time , his obsession begins to grow . So then ... ''`` Hey , listen , why do n't we go change in Monica ($_monica) and Richard_'s ($_richard) room ? '' Chandler ($_chandler) says quietly to Joey . `` But our clothes are -- ohh ! '' Joey ($_joey) then realizes what he ($_joey) means then they both leave quickly as Rachel ($_rachel) is still rambling on.Joey opens the door slowly to see if Monica or Richard ($_richard) is there and after seeing that they are n't , ushers Chandler ($_chandler) into the room , closes the door , and the security bar . They both start to frantically rip each other 's clothes off , but are interrupted when Monica ($_monica) tries to open the door . `` Hey , let me in ! '' Monica ($_monica) exclaimed annoyed . `` I ($_chandler) need to get changed ! ''`` Well , I ($_chandler) 've got a-a girl in here ... '' Chandler ($_chandler) said in a panic tone as Joey ($_joey) slapped his ($_joey) arm and gave him ($_joey) a dirty look . `` No you do n't , I ($_chandler) just saw you go in our room with Joey ($_joey) ! '' Monica ($_monica) said confused and angry that she ($_monica) ca n't get into her ($_monica) own room . `` Well , we 're - we 're hanging out in here ! '' Joey ($_joey) tried to say , really hoping that Monica ($_monica) would just leave . `` But , what if we 're watching a movie in here ? ''`` Why ca n't you do that in your own room ? '' Monica ($_monica) asked standing outside her ($_monica) hotel room . `` Rachel ($_rachel) is in our room talking to Phoebe on the phone , '' Chandler ($_chandler) replied . `` We 're watching a movie , Mon ! Come on! ''`` Which we are , and-and we already paid for it , '' Joey ($_joey) said , grabbing thw movie off the counter . `` It 's My ($_joey) Giant , my ($_joey) favorite movie ! ''`` I ($_joey) do n't care , guys ! '' Monica ($_monica) said angry as the men moaned . `` I ($_monica) want to get in my ($_monica) room ! Richard ($_richard) will be here in a minute ! Let me ($_monica) in ! '' Monica ($_monica) starts banging on the door . Joey ($_joey) and Chandler ($_chandler) look at each other and groan annoyed.Chandler and Joey ($_joey) are still looking for a place , so they enter the honeymoon suite . `` You ($_joey) really think this is okay , Joe ? '' Chandler ($_chandler) asked , blushing of how gorgeous the room is . `` Well , Ross ($_ross) and Emily ($_emily) are n't gon na use it , '' Joey ($_joey) explained approaching Chandler ($_chandler) and put his ($_chandler) hands on his ($_chandler) arms . Chandler ($_chandler) tried to ignore that smirk again . `` Y’ know , I-I do n't know if I ($_chandler) feel right about this , '' Chandler ($_chandler) said desperately restraining from kissing Joey_'s ($_joey) lips . `` Oh Chandler ($_chandler) , you are so adorable , look , his ($_chandler) is the honeymoon suite , '' Joey ($_joey) stated rubbing Chandler_'s ($_chandler) arms as his ($_chandler) face turned more red . Only Joey ($_joey) can make him ($_chandler) blush that hard . `` The room expects sex . The room would be disappointed if it did n't get sex . All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser . ''`` Okay , '' Chandler ($_chandler) said agreeing with him ($_chandler) now . He ($_chandler) did n't care about Ross ($_ross) or Emily ($_emily) , he ($_chandler) just wanted to have sex again . “Okay!” They both run to rip the covers off the bed , but are interrupted by Ross bursting into the room unannounced . `` Emily ($_emily) ?! '' Ross ($_ross) shouts in a panic . “Nope, not under here!” Chandler ($_chandler) exclaimed . `` You did n't find her ? '' Joey ($_joey) asked , occasionally glancing at Chandler ($_chandler) , trying the best he ($_joey) can to hide his ($_joey) sexual feelings . `` No , I ($_joey) 've looked everywhere ! ''
