The first thing Izuku realizes on the first day of school is that UA is massive.  Which is, okay, not quite a surprise—it hasn’t been that long since he was here for the entrance exam, but it does pave the way for his second realization.

He has no fucking idea where he’s supposed to go.

He stops in his tracks the moment that he processes how completely and utterly lost he is, jerking his head up and surveying the doors around him for any indication of where his class might be. 

He’s so lost in his own head that he doesn’t even process what a bad idea it is to stop so suddenly in the middle of a crowded and chaotic hallway until it’s already too late.

“Oh!” says a surprised voice from behind him, not a half second before someone slams into him and sends him stumbling forward.

“Sorry!” the word slips out of Izuku’s mouth almost before he finishes turning around completely, which is lucky, because the second he sets his eyes on the person who bumped into him, his voice cuts off in a strangled noise of surprise.

He’d half expected to see them sprawled out on the floor from the fall—not unlike Yagi on the occasion of their first meeting.  But instead he’s faced with a girl about his age, with brown hair and a soft, round face, and who is, most importantly, floating.

Izuku thinks his jaw might be touching the ground right now. 

“No, no!” she says, and reorients herself so that her feet are pointing towards the ground before pressing her fingers—interesting, does she need all five then?—together and dropping the couple inches to the ground with sudden applied force—not controlled flight then, some sort of weight manipulation?  She gives a little bounce, like she’s testing the force of gravity, and gives Izuku a smile.  “I could have been watching where I was going better,” she says.  “I’m the one who’s sorry.”

Izuku gives his head a frantic shake.  Crap.  He should probably say something—knows that he needs to say something, if only because he’s not going to make it very far as a spy at all if he goes wide-eyed and mute every time someone so much as looks in his direction.

Luckily, the girl doesn’t seem particularly upset or angry with him for causing her trouble.  That makes it a little easier for him to find his voice again, even though it still comes out shakier and weaker than Izuku would otherwise prefer.  “I shouldn’t have just stop—stopped in the middle of the hallway like that.  I was just—um, I was just—” his voice gives out slightly and he cuts himself off.  Best to stop while he’s ahead.

This is embarrassing.  A little bit of frustration bubbles up in Izuku’s chest.  Why is it that talking to Vicious and the others is easy enough (if uncomfortable) but talking to people his own age, people that he would much rather prefer to be talking to, makes him act like an absolute idiot? 

Luckily, when he meets the girl’s eyes, she doesn’t look irritated or weirded out at all.  She gives him a polite smile.  “Yeah?” she prompts gently, clearly waiting for him to continue.

Izuku swallows.  “I’m just—uh—I guess I don’t really know where I’m going,” he forces the words out, giving her a tight smile and rubbing the back of his head uncomfortably.

She gives him a wide-eyed look.  “Really?” she says, leaning forwards intently.

Izuku winces. “Yeah,” he confirms, resisting the urge to look around for an exit.

“Oh, thank God,” she says, and Izuku blinks in surprise.  “I have no idea where I’m going either!”

“What?” he says, a little louder and more clearly than before.

“Yeah,” she says, mirroring him and rubbing the back of her head with an awkward laugh.  “I mean, UA is so big!  How are we supposed to know where anything is?  Tons of kids have to be lost, right?  But everybody looks like they know where they’re going!  It’s really freaking me out.”

“Maybe there’s a map somewhere?” he offers awkwardly. 

“There’d better be, or else I’m going to be getting lost a lot,” she smiles again, full-faced and friendly.  “I’m Uraraka Ochako, by the way!”

“Ah,” Izuku stares at the hand she outstretches to him, until his mind processes what she’s asking of him and he thrusts his own out, giving her an awkward handshake.  “Midoriya Izuku.”  He says it like a question, and Izuku almost facepalms then and there.  No wonder Vicious didn’t have him use a fake name.  Apparently, he’s not even sure of his real one.

“It’s nice to meet you Midoriya!” she says, and then she hesitates, tilting her head to the side thoughtfully.  “You’re a first year too, right?” she asks, and Izuku stops.  For a moment, a voice hisses in his head: why does she want to know?  Izuku silences it quickly.  She’s just curious, he knows.  It might go against his better sensibilities to just reveal information about himself to anyone who asks, but it’s harmless, and Izuku’s not going to let himself be rude just because he’s predisposed to paranoia.

He gives her a small nod.

“Cool!”  Uraraka beams.  “We have like thirty minutes.  Do you want to, like, help each other find our classes or something?  I mean—if not, it’s totally cool.  I’d just feel a lot better being lost with someone else, you know?”

Izuku hates to admit it, but he probably would too.  And, well…he looks closely at Uraraka.  Her body language is open and loose.  She seems truly friendly, not like she has an ulterior motive, and—wait, what?  Izuku hates this sudden bout of irrationality coursing through him.  What ulterior motive do any of the kids that go here have?  They aren’t like him, after all.  Even the worst of them are still here to be heroes.

So, Izuku supposes, it’s not a bad idea to get some help finding his classes.

“Uh, yeah, okay!” he squeaks out and Uraraka smiles—again, Christ.  Do all prospective heroes smile this much?  It’s not that he dislikes it or anything.  Izuku just has no idea where one would even get the energy to smile that often and that truly.

“Awesome!” she says.  “What class are you in?”

“Uh,” Izuku ventures a brief glance down at his schedule.  “1-C.”

“Ooooh, nice!  I’m in 1-A,” Uraraka says—hero course, of course, with a quirk like that—and Izuku can’t pick up in any indication that the enthusiasm and interest in her voice is faked.

She starts walking down the hall and then pauses after a moment, probably having realized that Izuku isn’t yet following.  He’s still standing there, confused, like he’s in a daze and trying to remember what the hell equilibrium is and how, exactly, he can find it again.

“Hey,” she says.  “You coming?”

“Oh,” says Izuku, and then he glances up at her, eyes refocusing.  “Yes.  Yeah, sorry, I’m—” he breaks into a light jog to catch up to her.  “Right…do you, uh, do you have any idea where we’re supposed to start?”

“Not a clue!” she says brightly.  “But, hey!  I’m sure we’ll figure it out!”

 

In the end, they both make it to class on time, though only just barely.  The classrooms themselves are actually pretty easy to spot—it ultimately ended up being nothing but an issue of finding the right part of the building.  Of course, UA is large enough that that alone was confusing.

By the time that they’re heading off to their respective classes, Izuku thinks that he’s actually kind of sad to be parting ways with Uraraka.  It’s a surprise even to himself, but there is something decidedly friendly and nonthreatening about her, enough so that by the end of their thirty minutes Izuku might almost call himself at ease.

“Good luck!” she says to him, and gives a cheerful wave goodbye.  “I’ll see you around, okay?”

“O-okay,” Izuku says, voice still a little weak, still a little too high.  Still though, she responds to his own awkward wave of farewell with a bright grin, before turning on her heel and rushing to class.

She disappears around the corner, and Izuku swallows nervously.  He can feel his heart beating in his chest, just a little bit too fast.  He can hear his blood coursing and feel the breath catching in his chest. 

He’s going to walk through the door to Class 1-C, and the school day will begin, and so will his official career as…well, as a spy.  It’s like the first cracks in the foundation of a building about to collapse, the first few moments of a car accident.  The beginning of the end.

God, he thinks his hand might be shaking, which is so stupid.  What this is or isn’t doesn’t matter, not really.  It is happening and that there isn’t anything he can do about it other than roll with the blows.  That’s what matters.

Izuku heaves a deep sigh and clenches his fists tight at his side to still the trembling.  He needs to keep himself together if he wants to make this work.

A death sentence is a death sentence no matter how you look at it.  Izuku might as well just face it head on.

Izuku pushes the door open and steps inside.

He almost freezes in place.  Izuku has to admit, it’s not what he’d expected.  He doesn’t know what exactly he had been actually been expecting, but a perfectly normal high school classroom certainly wasn’t it.  Which is, now that he thinks about it, pretty ridiculous.  This is the general studies course, after all.  Why wouldn’t it be like a normal high school classroom?

The classroom is pretty crowded.  It looks like most of the other students are already here, but the teacher apparently is not—probably taking advantage of the minute or so left before the school day officially starts.  About half the class has taken the lack of supervision as an open invitation to socialize.

Most of the students are leaning half-out of their seats, trying to chat with the kids around them.  They all seem pretty excited—probably not just about the start of a new school year, Izuku is sure, but also about the fact that it’s their first day at UA.  The energy of it buzzes in the air, practically electric. 

Izuku cringes a bit.  All of his instincts are screaming at him to turn on his heel 180 degrees and walk right out again.  It’s too crowded here.  Too loud.  People are too interested in one another.  This is the exact type of social situation that Izuku has spent the last seven years of his life desperately trying to avoid, primarily out of necessity, and eventually, out of personal preference. 

He probably looks pretty weird, just standing there staring at the other students in utter petrification the way that he is.  Luckily, just about everyone else seems too caught up in their conversations to notice him standing there, frozen in place.

Izuku takes a deep breath.  Okay, he coaches himself.  All he has to do is just take a seat, and then he can just…not talk to anybody for the rest of the day.  Save socialization for another time.  His big step for today is coming to school at all.  Good plan. 

“Oh, hey!  It’s you!” says a familiar voice, just soft enough to keep Izuku from jumping half a foot in the air. 

A pale hand waves in the air in front of his face. Izuku blinks in startled surprise.  “Oh,” he says.  “Um, Akamine, right?”

Akamine gives him a small smile, ducking into Izuku’s line of sight.  “Hey, Midoriya!” he says.

Izuku can’t stop himself from hesitating, suspicious almost on instinct.  “You remember my name?”

“I mean, yeah, of course,” says Akamine.  He looks taken aback for a moment, eyes widening a little, but then he relaxes again, continuing warmly: “I mean, you kind of saved my ass.  I think I at least owe you that much.  I’m really glad to see you here, though.  I was kind of scared that you wouldn’t get in because of me.  I would have felt awful.”

Izuku shifts in place, uncomfortable.  Why on earth is Akamine so grateful?  Izuku hadn’t even done anything that special.  Certainly nothing, he’s sure, that most other students wouldn’t have done.

But…almost despite himself, Izuku can’t stop himself from giving Akamine small half smile in return.  Izuku knows that he doesn’t deserve thanks for what he did, but he has to admit…it doesn’t feel awful. 

It’s nice to know, at least, that he might have suffered from a shitty week due to the incident, but at least it meant something to someone.  Considering the fact that he’s, at least for now, still alive and breathing, Izuku might even say that that makes it worth it. 

“I mean,” he says, unsure of where to steer the conversation next, “you got in too?”

“Barely,” says Akamine, “my finish time was horrible.  I just got lucky—I guess not a lot of us gen ed kids caught onto the Rescue Points portion of the exam.  There weren’t that many of us who got any, so—” he shrugs, smiling cheekily, everything about him screaming what can you do? “I got in.”

Akamine gives Izuku a curious look, reaching up to absently play with a curly brown lock of his hair as he does.  “So,” he says, “you gonna stand here all day?”

Izuku glances over his shoulder at the door behind him, and then at Akamine.  “No?” he offers after a moment, voice confused, and Akamine smiles. 

“You can sit with me if you want,” he says, heading over to some empty seats in the front left of the room.  Izuku pauses. Typically, he’d prefer to sit in the back of the classroom.  It’s the most ideal location for surveying a large number of people at once, allows him to keep his back to the wall, all the while making it more difficult for other people to notice him.  Unfortunately, it looks like he arrived too late to manage to get one of those seats.  His next preferred spot would be near the door—worse visibility, but proximity to the exit would compensate for that loss, but those are also all full.  That limits Izuku’s options to where Akamine is headed, or to some scattered seats in the middle of the classroom.  The seats in the middle would grant him slightly better visibility and more subtlety, but the idea of being surrounded on all sides is distinctly unappealing, enough so that Izuku dismisses it offhand. 

He sighs and finally follows Akamine, settling into a seat in the front row, next to the window.  At least a window can function as an exit, it he really needs it to.  Though, actually, he’s sure that UA probably has all of its windows rigged up with alarms and other security.  Still, being near it makes him feel a little better than not being near an exit at all.  And that way he only has to worry about having people on two sides rather than being flanked on all four—

Woah, he catches himself.  Is he picking a seat in class or trying to develop a fucking battle strategy?  He wants to tell himself: ‘better safe than sorry’ but he honestly can’t imagine that, should he be found out to be a traitor in UA—in UA—that the location of his seat in the classroom is going to make any difference whatsoever.

If he gets caught—by the pros or by Vicious or by whoever—it won’t matter if he’s in the front of the class or the back or if he’s halfway across the world, he’s screwed.

Izuku absently notices Akamine sitting in the seat behind him, which is.  That’s good, at least Akamine isn’t an entirely unknown variable. 

“Oh!” says Akamine, and Izuku looks back at the other boy in time to see him lean over and start rummaging through his backpack.  He pulls out a water bottle out and Izuku almost does a double-take.  Akamine has a lot of water bottles in his bag.  Is that some sort of function of his quirk? Does it dehydrate him quickly?  “Here, do you need some water?”

It takes Izuku a moment to realize that Akamine is not, in fact, talking to him.  Instead, he’s addressing the girl who’s sitting just to Izuku’s right.

Izuku, careful not to make it too obvious, casts a surreptitious glance in her direction. 

Hm.  She’s one of the few kids in the general education course, it seems, with a fully visible quirk.  Her hair is glossy and black, and her skin glows with a healthy tan.  But most remarkable is the way that her skin is covered in large, expansive splotches of brassy, golden scales.  Even the parts of her skin that aren’t actually scaly glow with an inhuman sheen, like the scales are rippling just beneath the surface, about to grow out at any second.  Additionally, she seems to have a strange crease in her forehead.  It almost throws Izuku off a bit—it’s not quite like a scar.  In fact, it looks more like an extra fold of skin, though Izuku cannot possibly fathom its function.

“Oh,” she says, “yes please.”  She hisses out the letter ‘s’ like it’s a separate word of its own, a forked tongue revealing itself between her lips as she does, flicking out as if to taste the air.  She blinks slowly, eyes golden and slit-pupiled.  Like a cat.

Or, Izuku supposes, in her case, a snake.

Akamine hands the water bottle over to her, and she smiles at him.  “Thanks,” she says, opening the cap.

“No problem,” says Akamine.  “You need it.”

Hm?  Izuku actually glances over his shoulder at Akamine for that, and the girl furrows her brow, confused.

“I’m sorry?” she says.

Akamine looks at them, bewildered.  “What?” he says, and Izuku sees the moment that Akamine processes his own words.  “Wait—no, not like that—”

Whatever explanation Akamine is about to offer, however, is cut short by the door swinging wide open.

“Hellooooo, listeners!” their homeroom teacher says, deafeningly.  “Welcome to UA!”

The class immediately breaks out in uproar.

Three-quarters of the class are chattering with excitement.

“Holy shit!” says one girl from the back of the class.  “Present Mic is our homeroom teacher?”

“Oh man, are you serious?  This is awesome!”

“Woah, no way! We actually have a pro for a teacher?”

The remaining quarter seem a little bit confused, but they’re still enthusiastic.

“Oh,” Izuku hears one kid mutter, “he looks really familiar.  He’s a pro then?  That’s really cool!”

“Wow,” says the girl with the scales, to Izuku’s right.  “Is he popular?  I’m not from around here.”

“Yeah,” says Akamine from behind Izuku, sounding pleased.  “He’s really cool!  Are you excited, Midoriya?”

“Hm?” says Izuku.  “Oh, yeah!  I mean, I think it’s really cool that Present Mic is our teacher.”

It’s also kind of heart-attack inducing.  Izuku has no idea how to process this.  He can’t decide whether or not this is more of a good surprise or a bad one. On one hand, having a pro-hero for a teacher should make his job a lot easier.  On the other, it’s just one more reason for Vicious to get on his case.  And more than that, though having a pro for a homeroom teacher might make it easier for Izuku to pick up information subtly, it will also make it a hell of a lot easier for the pro to notice things about him in return.  And that can only end badly.

Yet, despite this, Izuku can feel a touch of excitement edging out the paranoia, if only just slightly.  He’s in a class taught by a pro-hero.  He’s in a class taught by a pro-hero.  It makes sense, of course, that not everyone recognizes Present Mic right off the bat, considering the sheer number of heroes in the world, but they’ve probably all heard of him at one point or another.  Present Mic’s pretty popular—especially locally.  He’s fairly well-known even on the national level too, which is quite impressive.  He might not be in the top ten or anything—known worldwide for their abilities—but he’s certainly not a pro lacking in a fanbase.

There are definitely things about Present Mic’s technique that Izuku finds intriguing, that will be endlessly fascinating to observe in person.  For instance, Izuku can venture a guess that the speaker on Present Mic’s neck is meant for directing the pro’s sound waves.  There’s footage (not media footage, just some shaky phone camera video taken by a daring civilian—lower quality than most of the professional stuff perhaps, but Izuku has found footage like that is what reveals most of the real interesting facts) from a fight two or so years back that he’d watched that had raised some interesting questions in his mind.  In it, Present Mic’s speaker had taken some damage in combat, and the footage afterwards showed Present Mic’s allies taking cover when he’d unleashed his quirk.  That would suggest that in its natural form, Present Mic’s quirk is either omnidirectional, or at the very least, possessing of a much broader range than his quirk usage with the speaker would suggest.

Whether Present Mic is incapable of unleashing directed blasts on his own, or if doing so is just very difficult to manage is hard to tell, though.  But if Izuku had to place his bets, he would probably say that it’s the latter.  If he’s recalling correctly, Present Mic also attended UA a number of years back.  A directional system like the one in his speaker would have taken some time to develop, so Present Mic would have needed some way to use his quirk without taking out everyone in a fifty-foot radius if he was to succeed as a student until it was ready.

It’s impressive.  The degree of control and skill that such a feat would require is quite significant.

The outburst of excitement has finally started to die down when one student puts her hand in the air.

“Yes?” says Present Mic, voice friendly, and, Izuku notes, naturally loud without being at all aggressive.  Habit, perhaps?  Partial hearing loss?  Some combination of both?

“Sir,” the student says, “I thought you taught hero course students?”

A wave of upset mutterings sweeps through the class, as if people are legitimately worried that Present Mic has walked into the wrong classroom by accident and is about to realize his mistake and leave.

“I do!” says Present Mic without missing a beat.  “I teach English to classes 1-A and 1-B!  But that’s hardly a full schedule of classes!  So yes, I am also the homeroom teacher for 1-C this year!”

The voices of the other kids even out as they whisper to one another, pleased again.

“Right,” says Present Mic.  “Does anyone else have a question?”

No one else raises their hands.

“Excellent!” says Present Mic.  “Then let’s introduce ourselves, and then we can begin!”

Introductions take a while.

Present Mic talks a lot—not that Izuku minds.  He is perfectly aware that he is hardly one to criticize others for talking too much.  He’s zoning out a bit, processing the words without quite paying attention to them.  Right now kids are just giving their names and answering whatever questions Present Mic sees fit to pepper them with.  Hardly anything pertinent to Izuku’s job here.

His voice is certainly loud, but after a little while Izuku has to admit that it’s not an unpleasant one.  He can see why Present Mic has found such success as both a pro-hero and a radio host—the man is good at talking a lot without coming across as too self-absorbed.

When it’s his turn, Izuku manages to choke a couple monosyllabic answers out to Present Mic’s questions.  Luckily, the pro seems to pick up on Izuku’s discomfort quickly and gives him a friendly smile before moving onto the next student.  He’s perceptive too, then, which is good for Izuku right now but might prove problematic later.

Present Mic is giving them a spiel now, about what will be expected of them in the General Studies Course—most of it is in the traditional subjects of study.  However, Present Mic declares, they will also receive some training that parallels that of the hero course.

“Even if they didn’t get moved up to the Hero Course during their time here,” says Present Mic encouragingly, “I know many pros who started out in General Studies and got certified post-graduation!  That’s how many successful heroes get their starts.  So it certainly doesn’t hurt for us to train you in these matters.  Even if you don’t plan to go into the field, or even if you don’t become a hero at all, such skills can only prove helpful.”

Present Mic continues on for a while.  His tone had taken on a lower, more serious quality to share this with them, but now the energy has returned to it, and Izuku wonders, vaguely, how anyone can have the momentum it takes to be so high-intensity.

But Izuku finds himself suddenly, incomprehensibly, unable to focus.  The hairs on the back of his neck are rising beneath his scarf, and he shifts uncomfortably.  He feels like someone is watching him.  He shifts in his seat, casting a sidelong glance across the room.  Nothing. 

Present Mic is distracted enough that Izuku doesn’t even worry about attracting attention when he glances back over his shoulder, and finally spots it.

He is three rows over, all the way in the back.  The boy in that seat is—Izuku recognizes him vaguely, with his tired eyes and messy purple hair, but it takes a moment.  It’s the boy from the entrance exam, who’d spoken to him just before the written portion.  He’s staring at Izuku like…well, not like he’s angry, but a little indignantly, like Izuku’s a puzzle that he’s trying to work out but that he doesn’t quite understand.

Izuku doesn’t mean to, but he can’t stop himself from meeting the other boy’s gaze.  Izuku doesn’t think that he looks angry.  He’s really not.  Izuku’s more confused, if anything.  A little bit curious, definitely.

But the other boy’s eyes narrow in return, as if meeting a challenge, and after a moment he slumps back in his seat, breaking their locked gazes.

Izuku waits for a moment, to see if the boy will do anything else, but the other boy keeps his gaze decidedly averted.

Huh, thinks Izuku. 

Okay, that’s definitely weird.

 

Izuku is getting a little blown away by his own ability to consistently underestimate today’s willingness to give him a heart attack.

Izuku had thought that walking onto the massive campus was terrifying, had been bewildered and uncomfortable at the chatter in his classroom this morning.

So this is stupid.  In the past seven years of his life, he’s had his life and his general well-being put under threat more times than he can count.  He’s worked against those who hold his life in the palms of their hands.  He’s broken into high-security buildings, stolen from important people.

So how on earth is he so goddamn intimidated by a high school cafeteria?

It’s crowded and chaotic, like his homeroom times ten.  Izuku had been considering getting himself something to eat, knows that he’ll probably need it—but damn, now his stomach is revolting.  His mouth dries up, appetite suddenly gone.  He tries to remember if it was like this at some of the other schools Vicious had enrolled him in, and he thinks that it must have been—after all, how different can it really be?  And that’s weird.  He’s never reacted like this at school before.  He’d been avoidant, and anxious as hell, of course.  But not freaked out to the point of dysfunction.

The weight of everything else must really be getting to him then, which…ugh.  Izuku wants to berate himself.  Of all the missions where his brain has to decide that, apparently, things are just too freaky and awful for him to repress, it picks the one where the stakes are higher than ever before.

But he doesn’t have time to waste yelling at himself, so he takes a deep breath and makes a resolve.

He is not going to go lock himself in a bathroom stall for the rest of the lunch period, even though he kind of wants to.  Instead, he’s going to behave like a rational human being and find a seat at an empty table.  He’s going to sit there, practice his breathing, collect himself, and get these irrationalities under control.  Then, if he has time, he’s going to get himself something to eat so he doesn’t fucking starve to death.

Right, okay.  That doesn’t sound so hard.  He can do that.

Izuku finds one of a few remaining unoccupied tables at the periphery at the cafeteria, taking a seat with his back to the wall so he can survey the sea of swarming students before him as he thinks.

It’s the perfect spot.  Unobtrusive, probably the quietest that it’s going to get in here, and it gives him a view of most the entire cafeteria.

And then Akamine plops his tray down right across from Izuku. 

“Can I sit here?” he says, and then promptly takes a seat. 

“Um,” says Izuku.  He knows that letting people get too close in his proximity makes it a lot more difficult for him to observe—to keep an eye out for information and for threats alike—but shooing the other boy away is sure to attract undue attention anyways, and, well…

Izuku doesn’t dislike people, really.  He’d only had Kacchan and mom while he was a little kid, and he hasn’t seen either of them in a long time, so it’s hard for him to judge since he doesn’t really know many people (or at least ones that don’t, on one level or another, kind of want to kill him).  But that hardly means he hates them, or that he doesn’t care for the company of others.  He’s just not used to it.

But as a result, he can’t honestly say that, on a personal level, he’s really all that interested in sending the other boy away. 

Finally, he gives Akamine a shrug.  For the sake of his own well-being, he’ll avoid inviting the company, but he doesn’t have the energy or the interest to force himself to be a dick about it.

Akamine smiles.  “Cool,” he says.  “Got this for you, by the way.”  He adjusts his tray so that it’s vertical in between the two of them, and Izuku blinks at it.  There’s two of every item on the tray, one of each pushed onto the side of the tray closest to Izuku.

“You got some for me too?” he says, confused.  “Akamine, you didn’t—I mean, I have money.”

“One, you should totally call me Ren.  And two, you weren’t going to use any of it,” says Akamine—no, Ren, sagely, shaking his head in disagreement.  “And your blood sugar’s low.”

Izuku snaps his mouth shut before it can even really fall open.  Hm.  He recalls that Vicious had cautioned him against analyzing others’ quirks for the sake of preserving the believability of his own ‘quirk’.  But Izuku thinks he has a pretty good guess lined up, and now Ren’s made him curious.

Still, caution can’t hurt, he supposes.  Best to phrase it subtly.  “How did you—oh,” he says, “cause of your quirk?”

Ren gives him a look of pleasant surprise.  “Yeah,” he says.  “My quirk is uh—it’s a weird one, I guess.  I just kind of…always know what people need?  Or like…sometimes what they need help with?”

“Like my blood sugar,” Izuku confirms, careful not to phrase his words as a question, and then after a moment he says: “You did it on the day of the entrance exam too.”

“Yeah,” says Ren, and then pauses, and makes a wide, expansive motion with his hands too.  “But also like, nonphysical stuff too?  Like, there are lots of people in here with low blood sugar, but I bought you lunch because I knew that you were the one who wasn’t going to do it for yourself?  Also cause I know you, but yeah.”

Izuku pauses, from where he’d just started picking at the bowl of fruit Ren had gotten him.  Now that’s interesting.  Izuku had still been making that decision for himself.  Ren’s quirk, then, isn’t just some scan of a person’s vital signs, it’s precognitive.  In an extremely limited way, perhaps, but even extremely weak precognitive quirks have a wide variety of uses.  Izuku can think of several right off the bat.

Huh.  “That’s why you carry all those water bottles, then?”

“Yeah,” says Ren, “you wouldn’t believe how bad people are at keeping themselves hydrated.”

Izuku ventures further.  This one’s a little risky, he’ll have to do a bit of damage control if he’s wrong, but he doubts that he is.  “And it’s why you came up to me this morning?  Because you saw that I was…um, anxious?”

Ren laughs lightly, runs a hand through his asymmetrical haircut.  “Ah, you caught me,” he says.  “I mean like—you look really nice, I totally would have come to you to talk at some point, but I could tell that you needed some, I guess, like, coaxing?  You have…uh, anxiety, right?”  Ren pauses, and then leans forward, face serious and voice soft.  “I mean, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want—I’m not like, trying to pry or anything.  It’s just that my sister has social anxiety and,” Ren waves his hand in Izuku’s general direction, “my quirk gives me very similar readings for both of you.  Yours is, uh, a little stronger though.” He shrugs.  “I could be wrong though.  My quirk doesn’t always work the best with like, underlying issues.  Or like, really complicated and tangential ones.”

“Right,” says Izuku, though he breathes a mental sigh of relief.  At least he doesn’t have to worry about that, then.  “And uh, no, I’m not offended.  I don’t actually, um, know?  I don’t think so, but I’ve never really talked to anyone about it.”

Ren chuckles.  “Well hey,” he says, pointing at himself with a thumb, “if you need to talk, I’m certainly anyone.”

Izuku pauses, looks at Ren a little blankly, surprised. 

Ren falters somewhat. “Sorry,” says Ren, suddenly much meeker, “I’m not trying to overstep.  I know that people aren’t crazy about that—it’s just that—I don’t know.  When I know that someone needs something, I just like…I feel like I have to at least offer?  I mean, my quirk’s not really much good for anything else.”

Izuku winces.  Damn, he hadn’t been trying to make Ren feel bad about his quirk.  Hardly.  It’s not Ren’s fault that Izuku has no idea how to respond to the kindness of others.

After a moment, Izuku purses his lips, and offers: “I think you have a good quirk.”  Ren gives him a confused look, and Izuku continues.  “It’s certainly a very heroic ability.  With a power like that you would excel as a rescue hero.  And I’d bet that you would also perform really well in a team, since your quirk would allow you to maximize efficiency and look out for civilians and fellow pros alike.”  He offers Ren a tentative half-smile, an awkward, forced thing.  “I’d love a quirk like yours.”

“Woah,” Ren breathes.  “Midoriya, that was, like, so nice.”

“You can call me Izuku if you want,” Izuku says, and Ren smiles.

“Midoriya!” chimes in another voice, also familiar.  “Is this a friend of yours from 1-C?”

Izuku blinks at Uraraka, who has seemingly apparated in front of their table, dragging a tall boy with glasses behind her.

“Can we sit with you?” she asks brightly.

Izuku glances at Ren briefly.  Ren doesn’t look at all perturbed, beaming at their new companions, delighted. 

“Uh, okay!” says Izuku, almost unable to keep his lips from twitching up in a half-smile.  He can’t say that he’s disappointed to see Uraraka either.  She’d been nice company this morning.  It feels a little weird to say that it’s been a long time since he was this excited to see someone again (except for maybe Mrs. Nakayama). 

Before he even gets the words out completely Uraraka is already sliding into the spot next to him.  “This is Iida,” she says, gesturing to the tall boy with black hair, who is mostly just standing there looking uncomfortable.

After a pause, Iida takes a seat opposite from him and Uraraka, next to Akamine.  “Uh, yes,” he says.  “Hello, it’s very nice to meet you—Midoriya, was it?  And…um?” he glances at Ren, lost.

Ren smiles at Iida politely.  “Ren,” he introduces himself shortly, and then reaches into his bag to pull out a small scrap of cloth.  “For your glasses,” he says simply.

Iida blinks, startled.  “Why, how did you—well, no matter, I suppose.  Thank you.”  He takes his glasses off and rubs at them briefly with the cloth.  And, oh, shit, Izuku recognizes that voice.  A quick glance at Iida’s legs confirms it.  Iida must be related to Ingenium—which, oh man, that’s cool.  Ingenium is an awesome hero.  His quirk is highly effective and all existing media footage suggests that the hero is a really compassionate guy who’s first and foremost interested in the wellbeing of others.  Ingenium had also trampled on some of Vicious’s smaller criminal ventures roughly a year or so ago.  It hadn’t been easy to scrub hints of Ingenium’s civilian identity out of the system without Vicious noticing, but it had been necessary to prevent retaliation. 

When Iida finishes, he hands the cloth back to Ren and fixes his gaze on Midoriya.  “I’m so sorry,” he says, though he sounds more firm than sorry, but Izuku thinks this might also just be the way he talks.  “Doesn’t it go against dress code for you to be wearing a scarf with the uniform?”

Well, Izuku’s certainly not going to stop.  And either way: “Solid color scarves are alright,” he gestures to his own—dark green, unpatterned.

“Yes, during cold weather, according to the rulebook,” corrects Iida.

Izuku shrugs.  “I mean,” he says, “how do you quantify cold?  I get chilly easily.”

Iida pauses, opening his mouth and then closing it, as if unable to come up with an appropriate rebuttal.  “Hm,” he says, bowing his head apologetically.  “I suppose you’re right.  My apologies, that was very rude of me.”

“Don’t worry about it,” says Izuku honestly.  “How’s your guys’ day been so far?”

Uraraka’s jaw drops.  “You didn’t hear?”

Izuku shakes his head no, shrugging his shoulders at her apparent confusion.

“Hear what?” says Ren, leaning forward in interest as well.

Uraraka drops her voice low, speaking to them into a loud whisper, as if she’s telling them a secret.  “Our teacher already expelled someone.  He had us do some tests and the person who came in last place got kicked out.”

“What?” Ren’s mouth drops open in surprise.  “But it’s only the first day!”

“I know,” says Iida thoughtfully.  “It was quite harsh.  I have no idea what our teacher was thinking.  But, well, I suppose he’s the pro.  Surely he must know what he’s doing?”

Uraraka ventures hesitantly.  “I mean, at least the kid who got expelled seemed kind of like a jerk.  Not that he deserved to get kicked out on the first day or anything, but he was acting pretty rude and stuff.”

“Who’s your teacher?” asks Izuku, curious.  Considering that general studies has a well-known pro-hero for a teacher, and that All Might is an instructor for the hero course this year, then 1-A’s homeroom teacher is almost certain to be someone that he’ll recognize.

“Uh, well the teacher who expelled the kid was our homeroom teacher, Aizawa-sensei,” says Uraraka.

Izuku stops for a moment, trying to run through all the pro-heroes he knows in his head.  But the name Aizawa isn’t even vaguely familiar.  Perhaps, then, the teacher’s civilian name isn’t well known to the public.  Izuku is about to open his mouth and ask when he’s cut off by a loud, explosive BOOM from the other side of the cafeteria.

His head jerks up on instinct, surveying for the source of the noise.

And then he thinks no, no, no fucking way.

“Get out of my way, shithead!” snaps the person responsible for the explosion, loud enough that his voice is clear and audible from across the room.  He’s slouching, he looks furious, uniform slightly disheveled, blond hair an absolute mess, and his entire presence absolutely, undeniably familiar.

Fuck.  Fuck.  No, this can’t be happening.  Absolutely not.  Kacchan can’t be here right now—but—except, of course he is.  How many times had Izuku heard Katsuki talk about going to UA as a kid?  How many times had that been the source of Kacchan’s temperamental outbursts towards Izuku?  How had Izuku forgotten?  Of course Kacchan is here.  He’d had the desire, the drive, the power.  There would’ve been nothing in his way.

Izuku swallows heavily, and averts his gaze.  He can feel Ren looking at him with mild concern.  He suddenly feels grateful that it sounds like Ren’s ability only allows him to tell that Izuku is upset, and not the details of what’s making him upset. 

Shit, he can’t freak out right now, surrounded by three of his peers.  He closes his eyes for a moment, takes a breath.  Okay, okay.  It doesn’t matter.  UA has a massive student body.  They aren’t in the same class.  Kacchan hasn’t seen him in seven years.  Even if Kacchan remembers who he is, he’s certainly unlikely to recognize Izuku, especially from a distance—something which Izuku is going to take care to keep in between the two of them at this point.  Hell, Izuku might not even have caught on to Kacchan’s presence here in the first place if Katsuki hadn’t fucking unleashed his quirk in the middle of the cafeteria, and Izuku has nothing—no quirk by which to be recognized. 

Izuku releases a breath.  It’s okay.  It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay.  He’s had a rough few months, and encountering an old childhood friend (and bully, he supposes) is barely anything compared to some of the shit he’s been through in the past six months, much less the past seven years.  But telling himself that doesn’t stop the weird, itchy feeling that’s crawling under his skin now.  It doesn’t get rid of the sudden, dizzying wave of nausea Izuku feels at this new knowledge.  But it doesn’t matter.  He can’t let it.  He can work around this.  He has to. 

“Anyways,” continues Uraraka, turning her attention back to the table and away from the commotion, “how’s your day been going so far?”

Oh, thank God, thinks Izuku, something else to think about.

“Uh,” says Izuku, voice a bit squeakier than he’d like, “pretty good, I guess.”

“Definitely not as dramatic as yours,” confirms Ren.

Now that’s for sure.  Mic-sensei is loud, but he’s far too friendly for Izuku to imagine him pulling a similar stunt to 1-A’s homeroom teacher.  Izuku tries to imagine how things would have gone down if he had. 

Knowing his own luck, Izuku is quite sure he would have been a shoe-in for last place, and then, oh man, what would he have done?  Oh, please, Mic-sensei, don’t expel me.  If I get kicked out of UA it will literally kill me. 

Though the irony of escaping death by scraping into UA by the skin of his teeth only to get kicked out on the first day would probably have proven sharp enough to strike Izuku dead on the spot. 

Yeah, so thank God for small mercies, Izuku supposes.

 

In Uraraka’s honest opinion, the lunch period ends far too quickly.  She and the others all walk with together out into the hallway, chatting amiably for as long as they can before they have to part ways.

Her first day of school, she has to admit, is actually going quite well.  Kids are nicer here than they had been in middle school.  Not that Uraraka had ever really been a victim of bullying in middle school or anything.  She’d been much more fortunate in that respect than a lot of other kids.  But looking back on it, as fond as she is as some of the people that she’d gone to school with, it’s hard to say that anyone was ever quite as interested in being her friend as she was in being theirs.

But if Uraraka’s judging UA by today, she might be starting to develop some high hopes.

Iida, for instance, definitely comes off as stiff at first impression, but some conversation reveals someone genuinely friendly and invested in the well-being of others.  His insistence on following the rules is stringent, certainly, but she can tell that it comes a place that is honestly well-intended, and that makes all the difference.

Midoriya is interesting as well.  The other boy is obviously painfully shy.  She’d be willing to bet that he wears that scarf of his with the uniform just so he can have a place to hide his face when he gets overwhelmed.  He can’t seem to make eye contact with any of them for more than a couple seconds at a time and half his sentences are either stuttered or inaudible.  Though, Uraraka notes, he’s already made marked improvement since they first met this morning.  Perhaps he’s starting to adjust already?  But despite his shyness, Midoriya’s clearly making an effort to be nice, and for all his awkwardness, Uraraka thinks that his company is quite pleasant. 

Ren, too, is intriguing, if only because Uraraka is seriously confused by how he isn’t in the hero course.  He’d told Uraraka and Iida some stuff about his quirk a couple minutes into their conversation, and Uraraka and Iida were both quick to agree with Midoriya.  Ren’s quirk will be an excellent fit for hero work.

They’re nice company, which is precisely why they’re taking their time parting ways.  Plus, they still have a good ten minutes before they need to be back in the classroom (Uraraka had been quick to shut down Iida’s declaration that being at least ten minutes early to anything is the polite thing to do—no way are they going to ditch their new friends early.)

They’re almost out when Uraraka spots Aizawa-sensei in her peripheral vision.  He’s chatting with another instructor, looking aggravated and tired, though at this point Uraraka’s starting to question if that just might be the way that his face just is. 

Ren is distracted, gesturing in the air as he explains something to Iida, who nods wisely.

So Uraraka tugs subtly on the sleeve of Midoriya’s jacket.  “You didn’t know who Aizawa-sensei was, right?”

Midoriya jumps a little under her hand, but after he seems to realize that it’s just her he chuckles nervously and meets her eyes for a moment.  “Not a clue,” he confirms, voice nervous.

Uraraka points in Aizawa-sensei’s direction.  “That’s him,” she whispers, conspiratorial.

It’s not like she expects Midoriya to recognize Aizawa-sensei or anything.  None of the other kids in class 1-A had, and she’s pointing him out mainly so Midoriya can have a better mental image of some of the details of her story from earlier.

And this is precisely why she’s painfully surprised when Midoriya glances up in the direction she’s pointing and promptly goes dead pale. 

“Oh, shit,” says Midoriya, and Uraraka blinks at him in startled surprise.  What?  For a second, she thinks that Midoriya is just playing around, just joking, but a quick glance at him reveals that that is definitely not the case.

Midoriya looks freaked.  Like really, really freaked.  He backs up a couple steps, moving away from Aizawa-sensei even though they’re already twenty feet apart.  His eyes, which had previously been the only part of him that didn’t look anxious and frightened but were rather sharp and thoughtful, unfocus slightly.  He looks, for just a moment, like a wild animal, cornered and afraid.

Ren and Iida are staring at Midoriya in surprise and concern now as well.  Uraraka frowns.

“Do you know Aizawa-sensei, Midoriya?” she tries.

He doesn’t respond, still staring in Aizawa-sensei’s direction and breathing just a little too heavily.

Uraraka frowns.  “Midoriya?” she tries again.

And just like that, Midoriya seems to snap out of it.  He glances at Uraraka, blinks a couple times like he’s coming out of a daze, and the glassy glaze in his eyes fades away.  “Uh,” he says, drawing the syllable out for much too long.  “No, we’ve never met.  He just, uh.  He looks scary.”

Lie.

Ren and Iida, who Uraraka is pretty sure only caught the tail end of Midoriya’s reaction, seem to buy it, returning to their conversation after a brief moment’s hesitation.

But Uraraka knows that there’s no way that that reaction makes sense.  She thinks that Aizawa-sensei looks kind of scary too, and so had most of the rest of Class 1-A, but no one had acted like that.  And even though Midoriya seems more skittish than anyone in Class 1-A, this reaction just seems disproportionate.  But what other reason could there be?  And what can she do about it?

“Right,” she says, trying to give Midoriya a reassuring smile.  She puts a hand on his shoulder, turns him around so he’s facing forwards, and tries to usher him along with her as they start walking again.  He gives her hand a surprised look, but after a moment kind of leans into it, letting her steer him along slightly. 

It’s the least she can do.  Uraraka has no idea what freaked Midoriya out like that.  She wishes that she did—or that she was close enough to Midoriya to push and find out.  But she isn’t, nor is she brave enough to put their just-budding friendship at risk by pushing his boundaries to try and get him to tell her. 

So Uraraka settles for trying to provide him some semblance of physical reassurance, and she forces herself to let it go.

 

Izuku starts heading back to the apartment immediately after school lets out, ducking out as quickly as possible and taking care not to linger. 

All in all, Izuku supposes that his first day of school wasn’t a total disaster.  He has nothing in the way of information, really, aside from managing to develop a fairly comprehensive list of most of UA’s teaching staff—which is not typically released to the public.  That’s fairly lucky, the sort of information that might sate Vicious slightly without putting anyone’s lives at active risk.  He’ll have to omit a couple names from the list—names of heroes whose work relies on the utmost secrecy of their civilian identities (including, apparently, fucking Eraserhead)—but it’s something, at least.

He didn’t get to see All Might, which is, like many things at UA have proven to be, simultaneously a relief and incredibly disappointing.  It’s obvious enough that All Might must be teaching the hero course though, and there’s likely not much need to instructors to interact with students that aren’t their own, which might explain why the Number One hero was largely not around today.

That could prove to be a complicating factor, since at this point All Might is what Vicious cares about the most, but it’s hard to tell for sure at this point.  Izuku will have to look into it. 

Luckily, his first report to Vicious isn’t due until the end of the week, and by Vicious’s own admittance, the man isn’t expecting overmuch from it.  That gives him time to dredge something up, at least.

Unluckily, Izuku had originally thought navigating UA without getting caught at one point or another was going to be an impossible task.

And now he knows that it is. 

Kacchan alone would have been difficult to deal with.  Izuku spent more time than he’d like to admit screaming internally about that little twist in the road.  But, of course, the universe is conspiring against him.  It flips him off his bike and then immediately hits him with a bus.  Do things go wrong this often for all villains?  Or is the world just targeting him specifically?

Of course, Izuku knows that he, to a certain extent, screws himself over.  He shouldn’t have reacted so intensely in the hallway, especially when he knows, he knows that class 1-A’s homeroom teacher probably won’t recognize him.  Iida, Uraraka, and Ren had all dismissed it, thankfully, but for how long?  What if Izuku lets a reaction like that slip through again?

After all, that’s how suspicion builds up.  A slip-up or two can be forgotten, but too many and the memories start to layer on top of one another.  People start to form connections, start to have questions, and Izuku doesn’t have any answers.

The only solution, he supposes, is that he just can’t let it happen again.  He doesn’t know quite how he’s going to manage it, though.  Today’s revelations have put him painfully on edge.  He feels drawn tight as a bowstring on the verge of snapping.

Izuku’s only a couple blocks from the apartment when someone stops him.

“Hey!” says a voice from behind him, short and irritated.

Izuku whirls around, instinctually adjusting his stance as he does.  And then his gaze focuses on the person who’d spoken, and Izuku almost slumps in relief.  It’s just the purple-haired kid from class.  Izuku straightens up, relaxing.

“Yeah?” he says, finding his voice this time.  This is the third occasion that this boy has been weird around him.   At this point, Izuku is more curious than he is scared.

For some reason though, Izuku’s response actually seems to take the other boy aback a slightly.

He recovers quickly though.  “How did you know?” he says seriously.  “During the entrance exam?”

Know what? Izuku’s torn between betraying how absolutely bewildered he is and his ingrained instinct to avoid showing his hand.  He settles for tilting his head to the side and waiting for the other boy to continue.

The purple-haired boy hisses in frustration through his teeth.  “How did you know not to talk to me?” he says harshly.  “No one else did.”

Izuku pauses, surprised.  Okay, what?  “Did you use your quirk on them?”  Izuku risks it.  There’s nothing else that Izuku can think this boy might talking about other than some sort of…conditional quirk.  Well, also, he’s a bit rude, but that applies to a lot of people out there.

The purple-haired boy rares back, offended.  “I don’t use it on other people for fun,” he snaps.  “Did you think I would brainwash you?”

Izuku suddenly feels very awkward again.  There’s no way, after all, that he can break it to his new classmate that this has nothing to do with his apparent ‘brainwashing’ quirk and everything to do with the fact that Izuku just doesn’t know how to talk to people without exposing his own so-called ‘quirk’ as a fake.

“No?” he offers.  It sounds weak to his own ears.

The purple-haired boy sighs, and suddenly, Izuku thinks that he looks very tired.  “Listen,” he says.  “Can you just…can you just tell me how you knew?”

God.  Izuku hates lying, hates pulling up fronts, and that sucks, considering how absolutely vital it is for his continued survival.  “Because that’s my quirk,” he says, practically pushing the words out between gritted teeth.  “It’s an analytical ability.”

“Oh,” says the purple-haired boy, and then he straightens his back and continues resentfully: “and for the record, I wouldn’t have used my quirk on you for the entrance exam.  There wouldn’t have been any point.”

Izuku pauses. 

Maybe he doesn’t have to lie completely.

“I know,” he tries.  “But, uh, just so you know…I didn’t…not respond because I thought you were going to use your quirk on me.  I’m just kind of shy, I guess.”

The other boy narrows his eyes.  “What,” he says, distinctly flat.

Izuku lifts his shoulders in a helpless shrug.  He tries to smile at his new classmate, but he can feel it come out awkward and stilted and strange.  “I swear,” he says.  “You just surprised me.”

“Really?” says the other boy, voice dry, clearly still skeptical.

Izuku frowns.  Quirk discrimination is a real issue, he knows.  As far as that goes, it is quite possible that the only people who get as much shit as the quirkless are people with quirks that make other people feel threatened.

It’s total bullshit, of course.  Hisashi and Masami both, for instance, have quirks that are mild enough to not, on their own, be dangerous to anyone.  That hardly means that they aren’t threats.  Izuku would rather tangle with a thousand so-called ‘evil’ quirks than either of them, and that’s including when they’re in a good mood. 

Because all quirks are weapons, in one way another.  Each one is uniquely deadly in its own way; their user just has to know how to use it to those purposes.  And Izuku is no fool, he knows to be careful of quirks that can be easily turned against him.  But it’s a mistake that too many people make, he thinks, to get so distracted by someone’s quirk that they stop looking at the hand that wields it.  Because like watching a person’s body language in a fight, if you pay close enough attention to the person a quirk belongs to, you can figure out if they’ll use it for you or turn it against you long before they ever do.

So there is no rhyme or reason in casting someone out simply because their quirk can be more easily used for wicked purposes.  It’s just an act of senseless cruelty, and it makes no one any safer in the end.

“Listen,” says Izuku, voice still quiet, even though he tries to make his words sound genuine, “how about we start again?  I’m Midoriya Izuku.  It’s nice to meet you.”

He extends a hand.

The purple-haired boy pauses, eyes still narrowed, like he’s trying to see what Izuku really wants from him.

Izuku doesn’t know what the other boy finds there, but finally the boy heaves a reluctant sigh and takes his hand, shaking it twice before dropping it.

“Shinsou Hitoshi,” he says, still sounding rather skeptical.  “Nice to meet you too, I guess.”

Izuku cracks a smile in Shinsou’s direction, and Shinsou pulls his hand back, stuffing his hands in his pockets and leaning back.

“I’m leaving now,” Shinsou declares, a little haughtily.  “See you around, I guess.” 

“Right.  Bye,” says Izuku, as Shinsou turns to leave, and then he hesitates.  He has no idea how people work anymore, no idea about how to reassure someone.  But…he has to try.  “Hey, Shinsou, one more thing?”

Shinsou pauses lazily, turning back slightly to face Izuku, eyes curious.  “What?” he asks flatly.

“I just wanted to say,” says Izuku, and oh, God, he can’t do this, “youhaveareallycoolquirk.”

It comes out a mushed together, jumbled up mess, which is probably about the best he could have hoped for but is enough to make him want to die of embarrassment anyways. 

But Shinsou blinks, looking kind of surprised, so maybe he made part of it out, at least.  “Oh,” he says, and his voice is the most friendly Izuku has ever heard it, though he still sounds kind of suspicious.  There’s  a flavor of shock to it now though.  Izuku wonders if Shinsou has ever heard those words before.  “You too, I guess.”

Izuku cracks a half-smile back in Shinsou’s direction.  Honestly, it’s nice to deal with someone whose problems with Izuku are I thought you were rude to me and it hurt my feelings and not you annoy me a lot but I’m not allowed to kill you.  It’s much more manageable. 

 

There are a lot of potential ways to spend the afternoon of the first day of school.  Some examples (in order of least to most preferable) might include: caving in to Hizashi and Nemuri’s demands that he join them for drinks to mourn the loss of all their free time, trying to formulate something resembles a lesson plan for his new class—considering the footage of their entrance exams and their performance today, they’re going to be needing a lot of guidance, or—ideally—waiting until later this evening, going on patrol like normal, and then slinking back home in the dead of night to catch a blessed few hours of sleep.

But instead of doing any of those things, Aizawa Shouta is here.

Doing this.

He sighs, running a hand lazily through his hair before giving up when it proves too tangled.  Well, there’s no point in putting it off any further.  He might as well get this over with. 

The agency’s door is larger than most, which is saying something, considering most construction these days is done with people who have quirks that affect their size and bulkiness in mind.  Luckily, that’s exactly how Shouta knows that he’s in the right place.

As soon as he steps inside, he’s accosted by a girl in her late teens.  Judging by her age, and the fact that she seems to be manning the front desk, she’s likely an intern. 

“Hi!” she says, voice bright and cheerful.  “What can I help you with?”

“I have a meeting with Fatgum,” says Shouta, voice flat, “if he’s here.” 

“Oh, yes!”  The intern gives him a bright, friendly smile.  “He said you were coming!  I’ll go get him!”

She hurries off, almost skipping.  Shouta watches her go, wondering vaguely if she goes to UA.  Probably not, he concludes after a moment.  She doesn’t look familiar—not from the hallways or from the sports festival, and she gave no indication of recognizing him.  If she had, Shouta’s pretty sure she wouldn’t have been quite so peppy, considering his reputation.

Shouta and Fatgum aren’t particularly close—not out of any overt dislike, but simply by virtue of the fact that they run in different circles.  But they’ve crossed paths more than once, and for as grating as Shouta often finds certain aspects of the personalities of most of his fellow pro-heroes, Fatgum is one for whom he almost has to admit a grudging respect. 

There are more agencies than there should be that will only accept students from UA, and occasionally Shiketsu, as interns.  Usually, the agencies use the excuse of prestige to justify themselves, or even more irritatingly, they do so out of the fundamentally incorrect assumption that the only worthwhile students come from the two top hero schools.

But as far as Shouta can tell, Fatgum has largely managed to avoid that pitfall.  According to Hizashi—whose sort of hero work lends itself to far more interactions with other heroes like Fatgum than Shouta’s does—Fatgum is fairly indiscriminate with the interns he takes.  To him, their school does not matter as much as their potential does.  And while, of course, Shouta is sure that he and Fatgum have very different definitions of potential, Shouta at least appreciates the sentiment.

So, while Shouta is certain that there are some fundamental ideological gaps between them, he supposes he can admit that Fatgum isn’t actually too bad. 

Or at the very least, Fatgum has at least one tolerable trait, which is more than plenty of other people Shouta has worked with in the past.

That respect is part of why Shouta is wasting his day coming out here at Fatgum’s request rather than resting at home, in his sleeping bag, like he would prefer.

After a couple of seconds, Fatgum makes his way out from the hallway that the intern had bounded down, and the intern skips out from behind his massive, lumbering form, returning to her seat.

“Thank you,” Fatgum tells her, and the intern beams, idolatry rolling off of her in waves.

“Eraserhead,” Fatgum says, genial.  He gives a bow, small and polite.  “I’m glad you could make it.  I hope you’re not too tired?  I know you usually work nights in addition to your job at the school.”

Shouta arches an eyebrow at that.  “I do,” he confirms, and doesn’t dignify the other hero’s question with an answer.  His appearance speaks for itself, Shouta is sure.

“Right,” says Fatgum, still smiling, seeming utterly unfazed by Shouta’s short response.  “Well, I guess I’ll get right down to it then.  We have some security footage that we were hoping you could review.  About a month and a half ago, we had a breach.  Someone broke in, hacked our system, and deleted information on a case of ours.  We were gathering about a rising criminal syndicate that was starting to infringe on yakuza territory.  Months of research and investigation, gone.”

Shouta blinks once, startled, and then narrows his eyes.  “With all due respect, Fatgum, I’m not sure what unique insight I could provide that you haven’t already received.”

“You’ll see,” says Fatgum, leading his way down the hallway, headed towards what Shouta can only assume is the security room.

Shouta hesitates momentarily, before finally following.  If it’s a waste of time, he’ll leave.  But Fatgum didn’t seem the type who would call him out here for no good reason.  Whatever this is, it’s worth at least looking at.

He trails shortly behind Fatgum.  “So, let me get this straight,” Shouta says, “they were skilled enough to get past your security system and get rid of key case files, but not good enough to remember to delete the security footage?”

“Well,” says Fatgum, “I imagine they didn’t think they needed to.  They hacked our security and triggered essentially a system-wide shut down.”

Shouta almost misses a step.  Shit, that’s impressive.  The data that hero agencies keep within their walls is sensitive enough that most agencies are outfitted with state-of-the-art security, typically acquired from the extremely expensive parts of the private sector (at heavily discounted rates, of course, since most security developers are keenly aware of how important the secrets of a hero agency are.)  For someone to take down the entire system requires a level of skill that not many have.

“Of course,” Fatgum continues, “I don’t think our intruder was able to predict some of the fail-safes that we put into place here a while back—including designing our security cameras to revert to reserve power in the very case of such an event.  Perhaps they simply hadn’t considered the potentiality, or were in too much of a rush to double check, but either way they left us with a valuable clue.”

Fatgum stops at the door to what Shouta can only assume is the security room, opening the door and allowing Shouta to step inside first.

The fluorescent lights in here are a little dimmer than they had been in the rest of the building, and there are multiple screens mounted on the walls, as well as several large computer monitors on desks lining the room’s edge.  It is to one of these that Fatgum goes, taking a seat.

“Here,” says Fatgum, “I will show you.”

Shouta sighs, stretching backwards before trudging over to Fatgum.  The other hero is tall enough that Shouta can’t lean over his shoulder to take a look at the screen, so he stands off to the side instead, watching closely as Fatgum shuffles through the computer files, searching for the right footage.

“This is it,” says Fatgum, finally pulling up a video.  “Eraserhead.  A while ago I showed this to Present Mic, and he told me to call you.  Said that you might have some insight.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I hope that he was right.”

Huh.  So this is on Hizashi’s word, then? 

So that either means that this is a complete waste, a practical joke—no, not in line with Hizashi’s sense of humor, wasteful of both mine and Fatgum’s time, definitely not flashy enough for Hizashi’s tastes—

Or it’s actually something significant.

Shouta straightens, suddenly feeling much more awake. 

The camera is focused on a hallway, presumably here, in Fatgum’s agency.  The footage is somewhat grainy, as security footage often is.  But, Shouta notes, despite being better quality than most, that fact is largely nullified by the dim lighting in the hallway. 

Fatgum hadn’t been kidding then—total system shutdown indeed.

Still, though, there’s nothing here that would merit Shouta’s attention specifically.

A couple seconds tick by. Twelve, fifteen, thirty.  Shouta almost asks Fatgum what exactly he’s supposed to be looking for, when it finally happens.

At first, it’s only a flicker of shadow in the corner of the camera, but eventually a figure—short, slim, unassuming frame, dark hoodie, facing away from the camera—steps into the shot, walking cautiously down the hallway before stopping at a door—someone’s office?—and bending down.  Whoever it is, face still obscured, makes quick work of the lock, tucking what must be lockpicks back into their hoodie before stepping inside.

Okay, though.  Interesting, but nothing special.

Thirty seconds, a minute.  Shouta doesn’t get impatient this time, though, now that he knows what he’s supposed to be keeping an eye out for.

After another moment, the door cracks open again, and the figure steps back out into the hallway. 

Though they’re facing the camera now, their face is cast down, obscuring it from sight.  That’s odd, considering they should have been under the impression that the cameras weren’t functioning.  Had they left the cameras running on purpose?  Shouta dismisses the idea almost immediately—even if someone had had the motivation to do something like that, it would have been exceptionally difficult to go entirely uncaught.  There was nothing that could justify the risk.

Then is this the body language of someone so used to concealment that it comes like second nature?

The figure, still keeping their head down, starts to walk back the way that they came.

Shouta twitches.  Come on, he thinks to himself.  Let us see your face.

And then they do.

It’s momentary slip on the intruder’s part, a paranoid glance over the shoulder.  A moment of weakness, just a split-second of irrationality.

It’s enough.

And…

Shouta moves almost before he processes what he’s seeing, slamming pause on the recording with enough force that Fatgum jumps beside him, that his fingers shake in the moments after from the tension running through him, suddenly winding him tight as a bowstring.

Only the top portion of their—his, Shouta knows, the intruder is male—face is visible, concealed beneath a dark scarf, an oversized hood, revealing only a hint of freckled skin and a pair of wide eyes.

“Present Mic was right,” says Fatgum, voice full of measured surprise.  The other hero doesn’t sound as shocked as he does curious, though.  “You recognize him.”

It’s not a question, but Shouta answers it anyways.  He licks his lips—when did his mouth get this inexplicably dry?

“Yes,” he says, because it’s true.

Shouta can’t picture what the boy’s whole face must look like—the kid’s wearing almost the exact same getup as last time.  But the look in those eyes, he recognizes it.  It had haunted him incessantly for months.  It still lurks in the back of his mind at times, even now, edging on two years later.  The eyes of a creature injured, of an animal hunted.

Of a child, afraid.

“Do you know him?” says Fatgum, slightly more urgent now.  “Do you know who he is?”

Shouta shakes his head softly.  “No,” he says.  “I don’t.  But I’ve been trying to find out.”

Fatgum hesitates.  “How do you know him?” asks the other pro-hero after a moment, sounding almost like he doesn’t want to know the answer.

Shouta takes a deep breath, stares at the image on the computer screen for another second.  There’s not really any other way to put this than honestly.  There’s no point in mincing his words.

“Well,” says Shouta simply, “he saved my life.”
