<p/>But despite the house arrest , Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help but smile . His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) Midoriya mom seems pretty excited , too -- she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) Midoriya rock firsthand , and although she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) ca n't entirely grasp how it took Izuku Izuku fourteen years to figure out bending , she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) 's ecstatic for her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) son .


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) phone at the same time .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Oh , I 'm so excited for you , Izuku Izuku ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I 'm going to make you a cake . And I 'll call your father -- oh ! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) 'll be so surprised ! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might want to come back in when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has a free day to say congrats -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Mom . Mom -- thank you . I 'm happy you 're excited , too , ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Midoriya smiles warmly . <div class="bookquote">`` But seriously , you do n't have to make me Midoriya a cake . I Midoriya kind of just want to go to bed right now , I Midoriya 'm beat . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) blinks , then beams back at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh , of course ! It 's been quite the day for you Midoriya -- I should have figured you Midoriya 'd want to sleep . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) places her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) son . Standing on tiptoes , she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) deposits a kiss on Midoriya Midoriya 's forehead .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'm very proud of you , ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) says softly . <div class="bookquote">`` You never gave up , did you ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya smiles , then shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya head slowly . She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) holds his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) eyes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya bedroom .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Night , Mom . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Goodnight , Izuku Izuku . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The door closes behind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya plops onto his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya bed , dwelling on what a day it 's been .


<p/>How could his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ?


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World to talk to All Might and figure out his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya plan , pronto .


<p/>The only method he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya knows of is sleep -- when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya falls asleep , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya should be able to go there .


<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya tries . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya lays on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya bed , staring blankly at the ceiling .


<p/>This should be easy -- he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the Spirit World , so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya should be able to cross over with no problem . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm .


<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya gazes upwards and tries to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya thoughts , muffled worries cloud his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya mind .


<p/>Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ?


<p/>Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice .


<p/>What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ?


<p/>The_Spirit_World The_Spirit_World slips from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World grasp and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World shifts to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World side with a weary sigh , resigning himself The_Spirit_World to a restless sleep .


<p/>x


<p/>There 's no school the next day and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World mom leaves the house telling him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World to stay put and rest -- but the second she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) closes the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World pulls on a jacket and slides on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World shoes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World 's not well , but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World ca n't rest easy until he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World knows the full extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World bending abilities . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World has to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) The_Spirit_World can bend more than just earth and air .


<p/>Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya Midoriya comes to a stop . His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya senses slightly , but overall he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya feels much more focused and refreshed . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away .


<p/>First up : waterbending .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya mimics the movements he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles .


<p/>But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't figure out how to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh .


<p/>Okay , now for the one he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya has even less hope with : firebending .


<p/>It 's the same deal as waterbending ; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya Midoriya ca n't tap into it .


<p/>Sure , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya 's got fight in him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't seem to draw it out in the form of fire .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya treks back home , disappointed but not surprised .


<p/>All that 's left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers .


<p/>x


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya cross over .


<p/>But nothing works . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya always begins to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya troubles , to worry about the path ahead .


<p/>It 's a cycle -- his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya anxiety means he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya even more anxiety . It 's excessively stupid and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya needs to calm down , to let his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya worries go .


<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't . That 's not in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya nature .


<p/>It 's after another failed attempt that Midoriya Midoriya hoists himself Midoriya , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya goes to sit at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya desk , head in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya hands , staring at the wood grain below .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya 's beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All_Might All_Might was a fever dream , that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya 's the avatar but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya never actually had that discussion with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya predecessor .


<p/>Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya so bad at this ? Was n't this supposed to come naturally ?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya stares at the desk for another second , then raises his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya head . Reaching for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya laptop , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya flips it open and frantically types .


<p/>avatar life biographies


<p/>It 's a dumb Google search , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya knows . But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya needs to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya 's not alone , that what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya 's going through is normal .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya clicks the first link and begins to read .


<p/>An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that did n't master all the elements until she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult .


<p/>The story that comforts him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya the most is All_Might All_Might 's .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Avatar_Toshinori Avatar_Toshinori was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World until he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Avatar_Toshinori was eighteen , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the article reads . <div class="bookquote">`` When asked about the most difficult part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Avatar_Toshinori journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Avatar_Toshinori responded with : ` the spiritual aspect . '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya face .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya 's not alone . He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya 's never been alone . His (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya struggle has been going on for centuries , and he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya 's far from the first avatar to not know what to do .


<p/>Even when a deep tiredness settles into his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya bones , he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya continues to scroll through his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya past lives .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya feels connected .


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there 's something like a humming that leaks into his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya ears . He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya , filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya ears and sinking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya limbs .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya lets it engulf him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>x


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya can sense the difference before his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya eyes even flick open .


<p/>The air around him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya feels lighter , the ache of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya limbs fading and the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya eyelids lessening .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen .


<p/>A sense of panic settles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya core .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` All_Might All_Might ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya questions quietly . Only silence greets him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya . Then it hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding .


<p/>Something 's wrong .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya nervously scans , trying to find the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya unease .


<p/>A wave of something hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya sees it .


<p/>Maybe it 's his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya imagination -- there 's shifting on a tree 15 feet to his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers ...


<p/>A hand , but not attached to a body .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) Midoriya whole . Midoriya Midoriya is no expert on the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World , but he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya knows that that is not supposed to be there . He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible .


<p/>The invading emotions slowly fade as he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya puts distance between him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya and the thing , to his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya relief . He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya breath .


<p/>But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya Midoriya straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya thinks is the right direction .


<p/>It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya Midoriya merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya name somewhere to his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya left .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya turns to see the former avatar , picking his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya way over tree roots towards him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>Thank god .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya walks over to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya , the man 's presence putting him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) Midoriya at ease .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You have n't been here in a while , my boy , ''  (<font color='red'><b>an friend</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says , clapping Midoriya Midoriya on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) 's only met once . <div class="bookquote">`` Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya shrinks . <div class="bookquote">`` Yes ... It took me Midoriya a bit to figure out how to get here , but I Midoriya think I Midoriya 've got it now . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya 'm glad -- I Midoriya 've got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems relaxed , nonchalant .


<p/>But something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words bother Midoriya Midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitates , then asks .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` What do you Midoriya mean by ` trouble ? '' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'


<p/>All_Might All_Might freezes , like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's been caught in some secret act . It All_Might feels ... weird , pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) childhood hero to share information with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) , but Midoriya Midoriya stays firm , fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentor with a questioning stare .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to familiarize himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets .


<p/>Something in Midoriya Midoriya 's look must tell All_Might All_Might this ; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sighs .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , I suppose you Midoriya would 've learned sooner or later , anyhow , ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) . Midoriya Midoriya pauses , then walks over to sit .


<p/>There 's a moment of silence as All_Might All_Might formulates what to say ; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fiddles those long fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and stares straight ahead . Midoriya Midoriya just watches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya hands , letting the avatar think .


<p/>The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya Midoriya locks eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentor , now donning a grim expression .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says , black eyes boring into Midoriya Midoriya 's . <div class="bookquote">`` For both your world and mine . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` What ... What is it ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya asks hesitantly .


<p/>All_Might All_Might sighs . <div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya wish that I Midoriya knew , my Midoriya boy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>All_Might All_Might rises and stands in front of Midoriya Midoriya , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) restless .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All Might scratches at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head , staring off into the woods . <div class="bookquote">`` They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities ... Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya shudders and All_Might All_Might stops .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya Midoriya ? Did you see one of them ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy fidgets . Um, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fiddles with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers , looking down at the ground . <div class="bookquote">`` I thought I spotted a hand ... It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All Might mutters curses under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya Midoriya 's shoulders .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'm sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says , locking eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) successor . `` Do n't try to find out what it is .

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` You Midoriya 're not ready to face off with whatever this is , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cuts Midoriya Midoriya off . <div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya understand you Midoriya want to help , but for now the best thing you Midoriya can do is lay low and train . You Midoriya have a lot of missed time to make up for . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya has a point -- what could Midoriya Midoriya even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't worry , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says . <div class="bookquote">`` It has n't done anything too villainous , as of yet .

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The words stolen from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth , Midoriya Midoriya freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrugs away from the avatar 's grasp , rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seat and starting a nervous pace .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I do n't even know where to start , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mutters , hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chin as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walks back and forth . <div class="bookquote">`` Do I just come out and announce it ...

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya Midoriya . ''

<p/>All_Might All_Might pauses , then belts out a laugh .


<p/>It 's contagious -- Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh .


<p/>They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya Midoriya feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya still manages to put on a smile .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya was n't the <div class="bookquote">`` most charismatic avatar ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>for nothing , Midoriya Midoriya guesses .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I All_Might 'm sorry to laugh , kid -- I All_Might 'm just very happy to see you Midoriya so serious about this , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says , seating himself again . <div class="bookquote">`` Okay , back to business . You Midoriya know the traditional path an avatar takes . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Yes : you 're told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya says . <div class="bookquote">`` But I 've already diverged from all of that . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` True , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the former avatar agrees . <div class="bookquote">`` You 're making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that 's okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might All_Might .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You ca n't dwell on that , Midoriya Midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man says softly . <div class="bookquote">`` You 're a unique case . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya questions . <div class="bookquote">`` How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might replies , shifting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perch . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scratches the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya Midoriya 's shoulder . <div class="bookquote">`` And -- er , this is n't for certain , but ... it may have also been my fault . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya tenses . What?


The avatar sighs . `` My fight with All For One did n't just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony Harmony and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was ... crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` He (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could ` grant ' bending . I guess you could say he (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It 's faint -- a slight hesitancy to All_Might All_Might 's words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya Midoriya 's stomach .


<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) afraid ?


<p/>In an instant , All_Might All_Might suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead .


<p/>Is this what 's in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) shudders as All_Might All_Might begins to speak again .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but ... All For One wanted me to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) to the Spirit World , regardless . And he (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) was going to do it by force . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` So ... you were n't just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony Harmony , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya says . <div class="bookquote">`` You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All_Might All_Might nods . <div class="bookquote">`` And what a fight it All_Might was . It All_Might took everything I had to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) at bay . I 'm guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State the_Avatar_State . No small feat , but it the_Avatar_State worked and I almost had him (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) finished . But then I got hit . ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) concealed wound . <div class="bookquote">`` I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya furrows his (<font color='blue'><b>public</b></font>) Midoriya brow . <div class="bookquote">`` But ... sustaining injuries in the_Avatar_State the_Avatar_State is n't enough to end the_Cycle the_Cycle . Or block energy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` You 're right , the injury itself Midoriya was n't what did it Midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man replies , with a hint of ... embarrassment ? Shame ? <div class="bookquote">`` But after taking that hit , I was ... I did n't know if I would win , and I did n't want to be the one to end the_Cycle the_Cycle . So I went out of the_State the_Avatar_State for the rest of the fight . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya Midoriya 's head .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) states . <div class="bookquote">`` And ashamed that you left the_State the_Avatar_State , even though staying in it the_Avatar_State could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All_Might All_Might blinks . <div class="bookquote">`` Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya flushes , waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya hands in apology . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh , I 'm so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` No , my boy , it 's fine . ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might gives him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya a small smile . <div class="bookquote">`` Butting your Midoriya head into other people 's business is the mark of a good avatar . And it 's good to see you Midoriya already know about your Midoriya chakras -- those are important . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The blood does n't leave Midoriya Midoriya 's face , and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya squeaks out a thank you Midoriya .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` So yes , like you Midoriya said , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might starts again slowly . <div class="bookquote">`` I did n't resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` But why would that block all of my bending ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya questions .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well -- my theory is that I did n't just have one chakra clogged . ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man raises his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand and points an index finger at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead . <div class="bookquote">`` Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` And you think that carried over into my chakras , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya concludes .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ` spiritual aspect ' as some of the former avatars . So I do n't know if my running theory actually works , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says . <div class="bookquote">`` And while I 've come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So that 's what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya Midoriya thinks . But what kind of disconnect ...


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` But what 's important is that you 're here now and you 've already bended two elements , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says , interrupting Midoriya Midoriya 's thoughts . <div class="bookquote">`` You 've also attempted water and fire , correct ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya nods . <div class="bookquote">`` But I was n't able to do either . I ca n't really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't rush it , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might advises . <div class="bookquote">`` You 've only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks Midoriya Midoriya up and down . <div class="bookquote">`` And I feel like yours will be , as well . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` How can you tell ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All Might tents his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands , fingertips on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips . <div class="bookquote">`` You 'll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are ... Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya 's brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) Midoriya shoves down immediately .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya feel as though you 've only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Midoriya continues . <div class="bookquote">`` And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who 's always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The knowing look All_Might All_Might gives Midoriya Midoriya tells him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Midoriya that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Midoriya knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya Midoriya returns a nervous smile .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya must look confused , because the former avatar sighs .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might All_Might says . <div class="bookquote">`` While I All_Might am here to give you advice , I All_Might am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Your hardships and battles will be different than mine All_Might . You can not copy me All_Might -- that 'll only end in tragedy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya gazes up at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya predecessor , the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya words settling on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya shoulders .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya can save the world , but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya might not be able to save himself Midoriya .


<p/>The nod of understanding he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya gives feels like the click of a lock on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya heart . There 's no backing out ; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya fate is intertwined with that of the world .


<p/>All_Might All_Might responds with a grim smile .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` So tell me All_Might , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man says , rising and turning to thread his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya Midoriya begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flicker out like a lightbulb . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's once again in that black void , nothing but him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) , darkness , and the boom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentor 's voice .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` What are you going to do ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trains like hell .


<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's going to train under anyone , he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs to make sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bones do n't shatter first .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediate goal : fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plans for the future , fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body , and fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind .


<p/>Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei Yuuei entrance exam .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's been doing this for years -- fragmenting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future by compartmentalizing it . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 'll still have to save the world someday , but for now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just has to focus on getting into Yuuei Yuuei .


<p/>As to why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's so dead set on Yuuei Yuuei ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling .


<p/>Simply put , it feels like fate .


<p/>-LRB- Midoriya Midoriya ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB-


<p/>But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might All_Might has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars .


<p/>So Yuuei it is .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya house . Anywhere where no one will stop him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya from practicing . When he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya 's not in school , he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya 's sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya and which ones do n't .


<p/>The internet helps him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya more than he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they 're abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya Midoriya finds himself Midoriya compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya has a semblance of an actual workout schedule .


<p/>x


<p/>There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya Midoriya can learn combat moves by himself Midoriya by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't figure out how to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya power . He (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Midoriya has a set limit , but honestly , it 's not enough .


<p/>But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide .


<p/>So Midoriya Midoriya finds himself Midoriya back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya pitches his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya idea to All Might : teach Midoriya Midoriya the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya pass the exam .


<p/>The proposition brings a smile to All_Might All_Might 's face . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya Midoriya 's head .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't worry , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya assures . <div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya have just the move in mind . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>x


<p/>It 's backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might All_Might .


<p/>School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya Midoriya hardly notices .


<p/>Of course there are moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) doubts what he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's doing -- is Yuuei Yuuei actually worth this ? He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's the avatar -- ca n't he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) put off the hellish training until later ? He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ?


<p/>But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya Midoriya is painfully reminded that this is him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) catching up . That what he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience .


<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) wants to train with the best , he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) has to put himself on equal footing first -- his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) spiritual title does not give him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) to a free ride to Yuuei .


<p/>So despite his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) doubts , despite his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) fatigue , he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) pushes forward . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) sees results .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's sturdier , in mind and in body . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) has an artillery of combat actions at his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) disposal . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) power output .


<p/>When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya Midoriya actually feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya 's standing at the starting line .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya shuffles past the Yuuei Yuuei gates , his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya throat in his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya stomach and his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya legs trembling .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya did n't know at all , and a couple more he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya was hesitant about , but it seems likely he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya scored well .


<p/>Now comes the tough part .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya 's forcing himself Midoriya to be calm , clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya closes his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya eyes .


<p/>The worst that can happen is he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya has to go to another bending school . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya 's prepared for this . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya 's done as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya can . It 's all a matter of showing that work now .


<p/>Slightly calmer , Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya face and he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya takes a big step forward --


<p/>Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya topples but his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya mind stays strangely clear .


<p/>Of course , his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You would n't be Midoriya Izuku if you did n't pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid.


<p/>Right before he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there 's a whoosh and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya is n't falling .


<p/>In fact , he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya 's floating .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes go wide and he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya upwards , bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya from 20 to 90 . His (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya Midoriya turns to find his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya savior .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Are you okay ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div>A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya , arms still raised from bending . Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) big brown eyes look him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya up and down , questioning and caring .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya merely stares .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Sorry for not asking before using my Midoriya bending on you Midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continues , shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hip . <div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tilts her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and beams .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya feels himself Midoriya nearly go into cardiac arrest .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Uh , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya eloquently responds .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , we better get inside -- they 're starting soon . I 'm so nervous ! But let 's both do our best , okay ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Um , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya tries again .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Good luck ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says , turning to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way across the courtyard . Only his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya eyes follow , watching the swish of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yellow skirt as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya does n't think of how mortifying that was . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya does n't think of how experienced the benders he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya 's up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya does n't even think about the dreaded exam .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) Midoriya brain simply spits out :


<p/>I talked to a girl !


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) Midoriya shoulder .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Get moving , shitty Deku , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they growl .


<p/>It pulls him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) Midoriya out of his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) Midoriya reverie ; he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) Midoriya jumps at the sight of Kacchan 's red glare boring into him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) Midoriya -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors .


<p/>No taunting . No teasing . Nothing .


<p/>It 's true that Bakugou this_time_Bakugou had been a lot more reserved following the ... incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya Midoriya spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou this_time_Bakugou seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) this_time_Bakugou ashamed ? Angry ?


<p/>Either way , Midoriya Midoriya finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou this_time_Bakugou is plotting something .


<p/>-LRB- Or that Bakugou this_time_Bakugou thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) this_time_Bakugou 's plotting something . -RRB-


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya tries to wipe that unease from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya mind , changing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya thoughts to the task ahead . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya sighs , then follows his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya neighbor through those daunting doors .


<p/>They 're greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya Midoriya would like .


<p/>The silence from Bakugou this_time_Bakugou is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other 's presence .


<p/>The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya finds himself Midoriya in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya stomach as he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya thinking ? He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself Midoriya a spot in the top bending school in the city ?


<p/>Stupid, stupid, stupid.


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya nervously adjusts the green armband on his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya needs to keep it that way .


<p/>If people find out that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya 's the avatar , they also find out that All_Might All_Might is dead . The fragile peace that All_Might All_Might 's image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya 's forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar was n't even able to bend up until 10 months ago .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya might consider telling some of the Yuuei Yuuei staff if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it 's essential that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya keep this secret until he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya 's mastered Earth at least .


<p/>Of course , he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya has to get into Yuuei Yuuei first .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya thoughts are interrupted when he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Midoriya notices what appears to be their instructor .


<p/>A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya glances at some papers laid out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya uses one hand to slick his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya notes .


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya 's done , he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya looks up , smiles , and then shouts .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` HOW 'S IT GOIN ' , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The students</b></font>)</div><p/>The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud .


<p/>The_man Midoriya glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya mouth away from the mic .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` What -- you want me to ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya gestures at the mic , then at himself Midoriya . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that 's cool . That 's fair . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya steps away from the podium , then starts again .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you 're ready to TEST ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Midoriya mouth .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` That 's -- that 's Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya whispers excitedly . <div class="bookquote">`` Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bakugou this_time_Bakugou growls . Midoriya Midoriya shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya mouth .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Let 's get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei Yuuei is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting 's active use in careers , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada Yamada says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya , in turn , raises two fingers . <div class="bookquote">`` That 's why we 'll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/># 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada Yamada explains . <div class="bookquote">`` We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya looks down at the table in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya . Yeah , he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 's been working on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya power output through his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya sessions with All_Might All_Might , but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya is n't sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 'll just have to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya best .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada Yamada says , almost as a side-note . <div class="bookquote">`` There 's sheer power , there 's technical power -- we do n't care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/># 2 : Combat .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` And here 's the fun part -- the combat , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the_man Midoriya says with a devious grin . Midoriya Midoriya gulps .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada Yamada says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` We 've assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div><p/>A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Now , just beating the other team is n't gon na be enough to pass , of course . We 're grading you on a multitude of other things . But I 'll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You do n't want to be a bystander for this test . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` You 'll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada Yamada says . <div class="bookquote">`` But for now : go show us some power ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>the students</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) following wink rallies the students ; there 's a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya competition now dawning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>x


<p/>They 're broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya and Bakugou this_time_Bakugou are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya does n't bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya does n't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya stomach could take it .


<p/>It 's a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya edges his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya nervousness by observing other students ' tests . As he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You Midoriya made it ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>Midoriya savior</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya looks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya left to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya Midoriya is n't sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 's happy or sad about that . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya fidgets .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` U-uh . Yep ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returns not making it all the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes . She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be nervous , too .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , good luck ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Without another word , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes back to watching the field .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya is grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not wanting to small-talk -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya would puke .


<p/>The_proctor the_proctor makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) the_proctor way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . <div class="bookquote">`` All right , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) the_proctor begins . <div class="bookquote">`` First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div><p/>A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band .


<p/>They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both .


<p/>Whereas Midoriya Midoriya had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high .


<p/>But the test that catches everyone 's attention is a boy with strange white and red hair .


<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya takes to the field , something about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya seems familiar -- his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hair ? The dignity he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya carries himself Midoriya with ? Midoriya Midoriya ca n't see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya face , but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya knows he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya 's seen this kid before .


<p/>The_examinee Midoriya seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya 's given the go ahead , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya swirls his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged .


<p/>The boy 's palms spark .


<p/>With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya flinches .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique .


<p/>The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya Midoriya spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left eye and things click together .


<p/>A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending .


<p/>That 's ... .


<p/>That 's ... .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Hey , um , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the airbender girl</b></font>)</div>the airbender girl says from beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) . <div class="bookquote">`` You 're kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y know . The Firelord 's son . The one that hates staring . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>At the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) . Midoriya Midoriya snaps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya trance , jerking to attention and whipping his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` W-was I ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki Todoroki . <div class="bookquote">`` Haha , oops ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought to be ashamed , and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aims to be a top bender , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya gages it 's been long enough , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya shyly peeks at the prince again .


<p/>Todoroki Todoroki 's mismatched eyes are still trained on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya , the quiet intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya gaze making Midoriya Midoriya fidget . It feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya 's being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya skin and paging through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya weaknesses and secrets .


<p/>It 's scary .


<p/>The prince finally looks away and Midoriya Midoriya releases a breath he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya did n't know he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya was holding .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Can I go ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the test proctor</b></font>)</div>Todoroki Todoroki asks , turning to the test proctor . <div class="bookquote">`` I Todoroki 've done my Todoroki required testing . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` I Todoroki 'm afraid not , Your Highness , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the_proctor the_proctor says . <div class="bookquote">`` You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I the_proctor 'm sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Todoroki Todoroki sighs , then calmly moves his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) before stepping up to test .


<p/>The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord 's son .


<p/>What happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ? What must his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) home life be like , to make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that cold ?


<p/>But Midoriya Midoriya is brought back to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya has to go up against that .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Midoriya twitches in place as the_proctor the_proctor tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` That concludes the recommendee testing , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the_proctor the_proctor says . <div class="bookquote">`` Now we 'll move on to standard testing -- and I the_proctor must remind recommendees that they 're to stay put for this portion , as well . ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a shy smile , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor the_proctor announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air .


<p/>The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya Midoriya on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field .


<p/>When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya Midoriya starts feeling intimidated .


<p/>Yes , Midoriya Midoriya has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sees on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya Midoriya feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was horribly unprepared for .


<p/>But All_Might All_Might 's advice comes to mind .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you Midoriya 're fixated on , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembers All Might telling him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one session when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was getting particularly frustrated with the move .


<p/>Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power .


<p/>No , power in bending comes from the strength of your Midoriya own internal energy -- your Midoriya body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your Midoriya main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you Midoriya push it into the elements .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya breathes deeply . Focus on himself Midoriya . Focus on doing the move right . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya almost does n't notice the test in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya has finished .


<p/>The_proctor the_proctor pauses for a moment before reading the next name .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya Midoriya Izuku . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya jumps at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya name , then begins to edge his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya way through the crowd with slumped shoulders .


<p/>The prolonged look the_proctor the_proctor gives him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya feels too significant to ignore -- does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya swallows hard , then assumes his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya power stance .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya gazes down at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hands , trying to calm his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya heartbeat and praying he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya 's not about to do something that is n't earthbending .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Whenever you 're ready , Midoriya Midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the_proctor the_proctor says , making the boy flinch .


<p/>Okay , Midoriya Midoriya : remember your training . You worked with All_Might All_Might on this -- you should have this in the bag . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya shifts , steadying his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya feet and shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya weight into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya heels . This is the easy part .


<p/>A deep breath .


<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya begins .


<p/>The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya Midoriya moves his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya arms upwards from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya core and out in a circle . His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hands meet at the top ; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya calmly lowers them , clasped over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya heart .


<p/>Draw power from your core , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hears All Might say . Bring your heart 's energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya imagines that energy transfer , sees his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya power bleed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya chest and into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hands .


<p/>Down and steady , my boy .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below .


<p/>And Now!


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya thrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya breaks stance , oddly drained after the display .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya cranes his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher .


<p/>But the important thing is that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya actually did it .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya actually correctly did the move All_Might All_Might taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya exits the bending zone with a small smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya performed well on one half of the practical . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats .


Hey.


It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya Midoriya turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) Midoriya flinches when he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) Midoriya sees it 's none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto Todoroki_Shouto .


<p/>-LRB- Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Midoriya supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Midoriya shoes ? Oh god what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Midoriya supposed to do . -RRB-


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki Todoroki must be used to awed silence -- he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Midoriya speaks in Midoriya Midoriya 's stead .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` That was an All Might specialty move , ''  (<font color='red'><b>prince</b></font>)</div>the prince states , unwavering .


Um. Y-yes ? '' Midoriya Midoriya says .


<p/>Todoroki Todoroki does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya Midoriya mentally slaps himself for forgetting .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . <div class="bookquote">`` I admired -- ''

<p/>Midoriya Midoriya reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir did n't get along with the_Firelord the_Firelord , but to be so open about it the_Firelord ... .


<p/>Todoroki_Shouto Todoroki_Shouto must truly not care about family image .


Okay. Todoroki Todoroki , '' Midoriya Midoriya stammers . <div class="bookquote">`` But , um , yes , I admired All_Might All_Might a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bending tricks from watching his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) matches .

Hm , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Todoroki Todoroki</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya stammers , pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Midoriya collar and cringing under Todoroki Todoroki 's steady gaze . <div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya guess ... I Midoriya 'm just a quick learner ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Todoroki Todoroki does n't move and Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) Midoriya skin being peeled back by the prince 's gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) Midoriya skin being flayed . It takes all of his (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) Midoriya willpower to avoid scampering off .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... Sure , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Todoroki Todoroki</b></font>)</div>Todoroki Todoroki says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) Midoriya scans Midoriya Midoriya one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya resists the urge to start hyperventilating .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) Midoriya gets the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) Midoriya just had a very close call , even though there 's no way in hell that Todoroki Todoroki could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Midoriya . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) cover -- that , and Midoriya Midoriya 's horrendous ability to keep secrets .


<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya actually gets into Yuuei Yuuei , he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya 'll have to watch himself Midoriya around the heir .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It 's one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya mind and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya finds himself Midoriya both intimidated and inspired .


<p/>This is what he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya could be if he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya gets into Yuuei Yuuei .


<p/>This is the power he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya could practice beside , the people he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya could befriend .


<p/>-LRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya back . -RRB-


<p/>When the final test is complete , the_proctor the_proctor calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya stomach .


<p/>x


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it 's simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya needs to dress fast but taking his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya time regardless . How many times has he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ?


<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya finds he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high .


<p/>The rules of the match echo through his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya head as he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya pulls off his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Midoriya own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` This wo n't be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya Midoriya 's future .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Instead , it 's one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya Midoriya yanks them on and wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya had asked for a size up . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 's grown more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya had .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` The bare minimum to pass is KO'ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya shrugs the thick padding on over his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya shoulders , yanks the green sash around his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya head . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You 'll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The lights of the arena are blinding ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya squints as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya stumbles his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya way into the ring . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya pays no mind to his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya teammates , solely focused on calming himself Midoriya down before the match .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` If you fall out of the ring , you fail . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya closes his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya eyes and inhales deeply . This is it .


<p/>Some voice in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya head prompts him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya to wonder how Bakugou Bakugou_he_thinking_about is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about Bakugou_he_thinking_about he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 's thinking about , there 's no reason to be worried .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya needs to focus on himself Midoriya .


Hi again!


Midoriya Midoriya jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya thoughts , then flushes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya spots the speaker : pixie bob girl .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Looks like we 're on the same team , huh ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya Midoriya , then the other two team members behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` The other two do n't seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya and the firebender was a little zoned out .

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Uh-huyeah , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya says , internally slapping himself Midoriya for the mix of gibberish he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't help but spew .


<p/>Luckily , the girl does n't seem to mind . Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) 's used to it . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh well , I guess we 'll just have to watch each others ' backs . I 'm Uraraka Uraraka , by the way ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Uraraka Uraraka : bright , beautiful . How fitting.


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` M-Midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya replies .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Nice to meet ya , Midoriya Midoriya ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drops her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) helmet on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head , gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya to the middle line .


<p/>Well , at least that 's one advantage . Uraraka Uraraka seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending is n't terribly offensive , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) 'll still cover for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Uraraka .


<p/>It 's a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Uraraka joins his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Uraraka team at the start point .


<p/>The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) ears . Not that it matters -- he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) opponents and teammates .


<p/>The other team is just as terrifying as he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) anticipated . He (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) 's not sure if they 're Yuuei students or hired benders , but they 're older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) team is ... not quite so confident . Like Uraraka Uraraka said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous .


<p/>But the face that scares him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) the most is Uraraka Uraraka 's . Gone is her (<font color='blue'><b>teammates</b></font>) Uraraka cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) sees is icy willpower . Her (<font color='blue'><b>teammates</b></font>) Uraraka eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces .


<p/>This girl means business .


<p/>Rather than put him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) at ease , it disorients him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) further -- he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) 's not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Uraraka steals points from him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) ?


<p/>Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand .


<p/>There 's literally no logic in Uraraka Uraraka trying to beat you ! You 're on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you 'll get enough points anyway , you 've done the work and --


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` -- riya ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) startles , whipping around to see Uraraka Uraraka shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` They 're about to start ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) stumbles into Zone_1 Zone_1 and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya Midoriya looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... 2 , 1 : GO . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) does n't even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) stomach , sending him (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 Zone_2 . He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) wheezes a curse under his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) breath and then hauls himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) feet , scanning the scene ahead .


<p/>The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it 's already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) 's already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka Uraraka is cartwheeling across Zone_1 Zone_1 to avoid fire blasts .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya realizes .


<p/>Wait.


<p/>... Where 's their waterbender ?


<p/>The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya lands on his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya butt but then uses his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya ground contact to his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya hands , which he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it does n't offer as much protection as he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya 'd like , but it 's all that he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya 's got .


<p/>The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya peeks from around the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet .


<p/>Okay -- he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya to score a point . But how?


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya team 's waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) 'll be off the back .


<p/>Time for a risk .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya waits for a water-free moment , then flings his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya shield as hard as possible at the airbender .


<p/>It does n't connect , but it disorients her (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) ; taking advantage of the distraction , his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) Midoriya team 's waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) dead-on . She (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) soars to the back of the arena and over the edge .


<p/>Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya teeth , he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya leans into the stream so he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya 's on his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya hands and knees .


<p/>As soon as the water lets up , he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya 'll have to make this fast .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya keeps up the disk 's momentum with his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya arms , flinging the rock and his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya first point --


<p/>Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya and pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya into Zone_2 Zone_2 . Midoriya Midoriya 's disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya Midoriya drops his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya arms and cranes his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya head to look at the water 's source .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya teammate , wheeling his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya arms and prepping another water blast , does n't even look at him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya as he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork .


<p/>-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya Midoriya finds he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't be happy about it . -RRB-


<p/>A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left .


<p/>Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya still does n't have any points ! Whos even left to hit?


<p/>Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 's nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two .


<p/>Uraraka Uraraka is now engaged with the earthbender -- she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 's struggling , but she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 's staying put in Zone_1 Zone_1 . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 Zone_2 , looking to pick a fight .


<p/>Okay , there 's Midoriya Midoriya 's target .


<p/>The firebender , however , notices him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya first : she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) volleys off a round of fireballs right at him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya 's forced to roll to the side . He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya pushes onto his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya 's only done defense so far -- but what else can he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya do ? How can he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya fight when the_enemy Midoriya wo n't even let him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya plant himself Midoriya and utilize his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya bending ?


<p/>Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka Uraraka 's fight , he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya 's going to get hit .


<p/>Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) Midoriya gets a distraction ... .


Uraraka! Midoriya Midoriya shouts , praying that she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 'll be able to spare a moment . <div class="bookquote">`` Some air , please ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) jerks at her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) name , looking towards Midoriya Midoriya and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) opponent . Her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) gaze jumps over his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) eyes . She (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) nods .


<p/>Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) inhales deeply and holds .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya shifts his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya core to head back in the direction he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya came from .


<p/>Uraraka Uraraka exhales and hell breaks loose .


<p/>Something resembling a tornado erupts from her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 Zone_3 to dodge it Zone_3 .


<p/>Now! Now Midoriya Midoriya can go for the hit . He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya plants himself Midoriya , raising a disk .


<p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya can even aim it Zone_3 , the wind catches up to the firebender . She (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya stares , desperation clawing at his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya core .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` One hit ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya cries in frustration . <div class="bookquote">`` I Midoriya just need one hit ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya looks dully at the scene ahead -- there 's just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka Uraraka seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya again , if he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya 's still here .


<p/>Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it 's just him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya and Uraraka Uraraka . But she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) 's more than capable -- if he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya tried to interfere , he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya 'd probably just mess her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) up .


<p/>There 's a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya Midoriya whips around to see Uraraka Uraraka pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team 's earthbender stalking over . He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya captive , the sharp motion making her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wheeze .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win .


<p/>However , if Uraraka Uraraka gets knocked out of the ring and it 's just him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Uraraka and this other guy left ... Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker .


<p/>Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya Midoriya wins .


<p/>But it also means that Uraraka Uraraka fails .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya thrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya manages to stay upright .


<p/>Meanwhile , the_enemy Midoriya is in position , arms pushing out from his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka Uraraka 's rock coffin hurtling towards the edge --


<p/>With a guttural yell , Midoriya Midoriya slams both his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) Midoriya fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya , rocketing him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya away from Uraraka Uraraka and towards the opposite edge .


<p/>The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya Midoriya 's arms and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya swears he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya can feel them fracture in at least five different places .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya arms become pure , unadulterated pain .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya collapses .


<p/>Everything seems hazy as he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya watches his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the_enemy Midoriya emerge dirty but unscathed . The_man Midoriya lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya hands and Midoriya Midoriya feels a disk slide under him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya and two disks rise to box him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya arms .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't move .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya surroundings are shifting ; he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya 's speeding towards the edge and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya 's accepted that there 's nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya can do , that his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya exam is over .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below --


<p/>But gravity never kicks in .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya realizes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya lolls his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya head to the side and spots Uraraka Uraraka , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen .


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) adds her (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) left arm to the movement , circling her (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya Midoriya feels himself Midoriya begin to drift back .


<p/>When the ground is finally below him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya , Uraraka Uraraka stops bending . Midoriya Midoriya drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) Midoriya eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes --


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Aaaaaand your exam is over ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yells over the intercom .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya blinks .


<p/>All that training . All that work . And:


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I got one hit . Just one hit , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya Midoriya moans , dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya head to the ground . <div class="bookquote">`` What kind of a bender am I ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There 's something wet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya cheek and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya closes his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya arms . It seeps into his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya brain , clouding his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya thoughts , and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya fights to stay awake .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya to the healers , now ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One hit .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... what was that stunt ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One hit .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) 's okay , get her (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) a bag ... . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One hit .


<p/>The acrid smell of vomit reaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 's repeating one hit , why ... . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I failed .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya brain flickers off .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya does n't eat much those next few days .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya mother the only evidence that anything happened .


<p/>But the events of the exam plague his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya mind , looping over and over as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya tries to settle back into normalcy , as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya 's not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious .


<p/>Sure , he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya stayed in the ring -- but no way that was enough to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Midoriya into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds .


<p/>Bakugou Bakugou got in -- Midoriya Midoriya does n't have to speculate on that . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Bakugou 's dreading seeing the smug look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) Bakugou face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time .


<p/>Maybe Uraraka Uraraka got in . Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) 'll remember that silly earthbending kid that could n't even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou can learn from .


<p/>But it feels wrong -- it feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou should be following in All Might 's steps and learning at Yuuei Yuuei .


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou supposed to be great if he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou is n't learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) Bakugou have made with the four nation 's up and coming leaders -- like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou made those connections early ?


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya thinks of Todoroki 's empty , calculating eyes and shudders .


<p/>True , the_prince Bakugou did n't seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei Yuuei would have been a good start .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya is trapped in a cycle of misery -- thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou mother , the saint that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is , has allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou to mope for the week , only prompting him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) 's let him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou be . She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw it coming and understands that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou needs time to come to terms .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou does n't respond when his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou mom announces she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) 's going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou knows .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I-Izuku ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Bakugou mom</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . <div class="bookquote">`` It 's here ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya Midoriya simply stares at the black lettering for a moment .


<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) hand and walking to his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou room . The door closes behind him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou with a resolute click and he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou takes a deep breath .


<p/>Welp , this is it .


<p/>Here is the confirmation that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou needs a new plan .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou sits at his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou fears and he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou hungrily begins to read .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya_Izuku Midoriya_Izuku , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it Midoriya_Izuku begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . <div class="bookquote">`` The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score .


<p/>The written exam is what he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou expected : he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin .


<p/>The power score is actually better than he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score .


<p/>But the combat column is where he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou trembles . The <div class="bookquote">`` 1 ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>draws his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou eyes in like a magnet , confirming his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou fears .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou did n't score nearly high enough to get in .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou 's toast .


<p/>Resigned , he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou lets his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Welcome to Yuuei . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>Bakugou</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou eyes skim over the words , then he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou double-takes . He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou backtracks and reads it again .


<p/>It stays the same : <div class="bookquote">`` Welcome to Yuuei . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This has to be some sort of mistake . He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou has to call them , to tell them they sent him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou the wrong letter .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Bakugou eye .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She (<font color='blue'><b>Bakugou</b></font>) wanted to share points with me ?


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>... Teamwork and cooperation ?


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping <div class="bookquote">`` 59 ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>under it sharply contrasts the <div class="bookquote">`` 1 ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the hits category .


<p/>It 's not a mistake .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ...


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) actually got into Yuuei .


<p/>A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya Midoriya finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does n't care . It 's not until he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) starts crying in earnest that his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in .


<p/>Of course his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) first instinct is to tell All_Might All_Might .


<p/>The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) worldly contacts . But Midoriya Midoriya wants to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in person regardless , to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 'll admit -- All_Might All_Might does n't seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 's a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya Midoriya lacks in the waking world .


<p/>-LRB- Maybe All_Might All_Might is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB-


<p/>When Midoriya Midoriya clambers into bed that night , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows what to do . With his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) headphones playing a soft song for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lays flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) forces his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart to slow , makes himself ease his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) limbs melt into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bed .


<p/>The music from his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) into the unknown .


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) opens his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes again , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 's not in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) familiar forest .


<p/>It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya Midoriya can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 's grown to know .


<p/>The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) throat .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya chest and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't say why , but something in the dust feels ... alive ? Tormented ?


<p/>Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya has to help , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't just leave them --


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya hand brushes something solid and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya halts for a moment . Then he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya horror , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya realizes that it 's a hand .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya falls backwards on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison .


<p/>Several things happen at once .


<p/>The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya Midoriya in sheets , invading his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya clothes , his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya eyes , his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya throat . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya chokes -- more accurately , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya drowns .


<p/>The hand closes the gap , crawling over his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya foot and clamping onto his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya ankle . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya wastes air and yelps , flailing his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya energy wanes ; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya sinks , head hitting the ground . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya can only watch the thing with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya eyes , unable to escape .


<p/>It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya Midoriya 's blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body .


<p/>The mass climbs its way up his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya Midoriya 's . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya tries to jerk his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya face away but finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't .


<p/>I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes widen ; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya reaches at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya last scraps of energy and renews his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya throat . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya lets out a weak wheeze of agony .


<p/>The thing leans in , almost brushing Midoriya Midoriya 's nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya Midoriya 's spine .


<p/>It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya Midoriya imagines it would be smiling .


<p/>You think you 're safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice .


<p/>Midoriya Midoriya 's head lulls , his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya body .


<p/>How naive.


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya eyes are closed and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya 's barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear .


<p/>You obviously have no idea what 's coming .


<p/>Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya Midoriya 's armpits , yanking him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya under the mound of dust and into the earth . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya swallows dust and sees no more .


<p/>x


<p/>A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya Midoriya 's throat as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya bolts upright .


<p/>Escape .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya has to escape .


<p/>There 's something confining his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya legs --


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya kicks his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya way out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya sheets , stumbling from his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya bed and tripping onto the floor .


<p/>The soft carpeting of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya from the walls .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya 's in the real world .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya 's safe .


<p/>Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face .


Izuku! What happened?


Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya chest , then another .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya 's cried in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya mom before . This Midoriya is n't new .


<p/>But it Midoriya feels different -- it Midoriya 's embarrassing . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya 's supposed to hold up the whole world but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya ca n't even hold himself Midoriya together .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya drops his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya face in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya hands .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya in a comforting embrace .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` There there , Izuku , ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya back . <div class="bookquote">`` It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it wo n't . And he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya wo n't .


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ?


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ?


<p/>What is that thing ? What is it plotting ?


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Midoriya supposed to stop it ?


<p/>In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) Midoriya back and he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) Midoriya collapses under it , clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) Midoriya mother and soaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that :


<p/>A boy .
