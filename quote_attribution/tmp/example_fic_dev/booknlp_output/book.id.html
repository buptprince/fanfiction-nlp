<p/>But despite the house arrest , Midoriya midoriya ca n't help but smile . His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) midoriya mom seems pretty excited , too -- she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) midoriya rock firsthand , and although she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) ca n't entirely grasp how it took Izuku izuku fourteen years to figure out bending , she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) 's ecstatic for her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) son .


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) phone at the same time .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Oh , I 'm so excited for you , Izuku izuku ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I 'm going to make you a cake . And I 'll call your father -- oh ! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) 'll be so surprised ! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might want to come back in when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has a free day to say congrats -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Mom . Mom -- thank you . I 'm happy you 're excited , too , ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) midoriya smiles warmly . <div class="bookquote">`` But seriously , you do n't have to make me midoriya a cake . I midoriya kind of just want to go to bed right now , I midoriya 'm beat . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) blinks , then beams back at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh , of course ! It 's been quite the day for you midoriya -- I should have figured you midoriya 'd want to sleep . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) places her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) son . Standing on tiptoes , she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) deposits a kiss on Midoriya_'s midoriya forehead .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'm very proud of you , ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) says softly . <div class="bookquote">`` You never gave up , did you ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya smiles , then shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya head slowly . She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) holds his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) eyes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya bedroom .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Night , Mom . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Goodnight , Izuku izuku . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The door closes behind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya plops onto his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya bed , dwelling on what a day it 's been .


<p/>How could his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ?


<p/>Midoriya midoriya flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World the to talk to All Might and figure out his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya plan , pronto .


<p/>The only method he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya knows of is sleep -- when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya falls asleep , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya should be able to go there .


<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya tries . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya lays on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya bed , staring blankly at the ceiling .


<p/>This should be easy -- he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the_Spirit_World the , so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya should be able to cross over with no problem . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm .


<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya gazes upwards and tries to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya thoughts , muffled worries cloud his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya mind .


<p/>Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ?


<p/>Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice .


<p/>What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ?


<p/>The_Spirit_World the slips from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the grasp and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the shifts to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the side with a weary sigh , resigning himself the to a restless sleep .


<p/>x


<p/>There 's no school the next day and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the mom leaves the house telling him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the to stay put and rest -- but the second she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) closes the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the pulls on a jacket and slides on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the shoes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the 's not well , but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the ca n't rest easy until he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the knows the full extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the bending abilities . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the has to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the can bend more than just earth and air .


<p/>Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya midoriya comes to a stop . His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya senses slightly , but overall he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya feels much more focused and refreshed . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away .


<p/>First up : waterbending .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya mimics the movements he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles .


<p/>But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya ca n't figure out how to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh .


<p/>Okay , now for the one he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya has even less hope with : firebending .


<p/>It 's the same deal as waterbending ; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya midoriya ca n't tap into it .


<p/>Sure , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's got fight in him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya ca n't seem to draw it out in the form of fire .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya treks back home , disappointed but not surprised .


<p/>All that 's left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers .


<p/>x


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya cross over .


<p/>But nothing works . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya always begins to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya troubles , to worry about the path ahead .


<p/>It 's a cycle -- his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya anxiety means he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya ca n't make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya even more anxiety . It 's excessively stupid and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya needs to calm down , to let his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya worries go .


<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya ca n't . That 's not in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya nature .


<p/>It 's after another failed attempt that Midoriya midoriya hoists himself midoriya , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya goes to sit at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya desk , head in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya hands , staring at the wood grain below .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All_Might all was a fever dream , that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's the avatar but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya never actually had that discussion with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya predecessor .


<p/>Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya so bad at this ? Was n't this supposed to come naturally ?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya stares at the desk for another second , then raises his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya head . Reaching for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya laptop , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya flips it open and frantically types .


<p/>avatar life biographies


<p/>It 's a dumb Google search , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya knows . But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya needs to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's not alone , that what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's going through is normal .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya clicks the first link and begins to read .


<p/>An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that did n't master all the elements until she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult .


<p/>The story that comforts him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya the most is All_Might_'s all .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Avatar_Toshinori toshinori was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World the until he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) toshinori was eighteen , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the article reads . <div class="bookquote">`` When asked about the most difficult part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) toshinori journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) toshinori responded with : ` the spiritual aspect . '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'


<p/>Midoriya midoriya stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya face .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya 's not alone . He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya 's never been alone . His (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya struggle has been going on for centuries , and he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya 's far from the first avatar to not know what to do .


<p/>Even when a deep tiredness settles into his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya bones , he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya continues to scroll through his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya past lives .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya feels connected .


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there 's something like a humming that leaks into his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya ears . He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya , filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya ears and sinking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya limbs .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya lets it engulf him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>x


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya can sense the difference before his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya eyes even flick open .


<p/>The air around him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya feels lighter , the ache of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya limbs fading and the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya eyelids lessening .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen .


<p/>A sense of panic settles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya core .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` All_Might all ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya questions quietly . Only silence greets him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya . Then it hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding .


<p/>Something 's wrong .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya nervously scans , trying to find the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya unease .


<p/>A wave of something hits him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya sees it .


<p/>Maybe it 's his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya imagination -- there 's shifting on a tree 15 feet to his (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers ...


<p/>A hand , but not attached to a body .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>Avatar</b></font>) midoriya whole . Midoriya midoriya is no expert on the_Spirit_World the , but he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya knows that that is not supposed to be there . He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible .


<p/>The invading emotions slowly fade as he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya puts distance between him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya and the thing , to his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya relief . He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya breath .


<p/>But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya midoriya straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya thinks is the right direction .


<p/>It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya midoriya merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya name somewhere to his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya left .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya turns to see the former avatar , picking his (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya way over tree roots towards him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>Thank god .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya walks over to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya , the man 's presence putting him (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) midoriya at ease .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You have n't been here in a while , my boy , ''  (<font color='red'><b>an friend</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says , clapping Midoriya midoriya on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) 's only met once . <div class="bookquote">`` Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya shrinks . <div class="bookquote">`` Yes ... It took me midoriya a bit to figure out how to get here , but I midoriya think I midoriya 've got it now . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya 'm glad -- I midoriya 've got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems relaxed , nonchalant .


<p/>But something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words bother Midoriya midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitates , then asks .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` What do you midoriya mean by ` trouble ? '' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'


<p/>All_Might all freezes , like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's been caught in some secret act . It all feels ... weird , pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) childhood hero to share information with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) , but Midoriya midoriya stays firm , fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentor with a questioning stare .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to familiarize himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets .


<p/>Something in Midoriya_'s midoriya look must tell All_Might all this ; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sighs .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , I suppose you midoriya would 've learned sooner or later , anyhow , ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) . Midoriya midoriya pauses , then walks over to sit .


<p/>There 's a moment of silence as All_Might all formulates what to say ; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fiddles those long fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and stares straight ahead . Midoriya midoriya just watches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya hands , letting the avatar think .


<p/>The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya midoriya locks eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentor , now donning a grim expression .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says , black eyes boring into Midoriya_'s midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` For both your world and mine . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` What ... What is it ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya asks hesitantly .


<p/>All_Might all sighs . <div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya wish that I midoriya knew , my midoriya boy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>All_Might all rises and stands in front of Midoriya midoriya , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) restless .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World the . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too .

Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya shudders and All_Might all stops .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya midoriya ? Did you see one of them ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy fidgets . Um, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fiddles with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers , looking down at the ground . <div class="bookquote">`` I thought I spotted a hand ... It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All Might mutters curses under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya_'s midoriya shoulders .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'm sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says , locking eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) successor . `` Do n't try to find out what it is .

Midoriya midoriya breathes sharply . <div class="bookquote">`` But , All Might -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` You midoriya 're not ready to face off with whatever this is , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cuts Midoriya midoriya off . <div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya understand you midoriya want to help , but for now the best thing you midoriya can do is lay low and train . You midoriya have a lot of missed time to make up for . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya has a point -- what could Midoriya midoriya even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't worry , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says . <div class="bookquote">`` It has n't done anything too villainous , as of yet .

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya tenses at <div class="bookquote">`` contacts , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>recalling what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came here to ask about . <div class="bookquote">`` Uh , All_Might all , about the real world ...

''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The words stolen from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth , Midoriya midoriya freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrugs away from the avatar 's grasp , rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seat and starting a nervous pace .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I do n't even know where to start , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mutters , hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chin as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walks back and forth . <div class="bookquote">`` Do I just come out and announce it ...

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya midoriya . ''

<p/>All_Might all pauses , then belts out a laugh .


<p/>It 's contagious -- Midoriya midoriya ca n't help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh .


<p/>They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya midoriya feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya still manages to put on a smile .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya was n't the <div class="bookquote">`` most charismatic avatar ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>for nothing , Midoriya midoriya guesses .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I all 'm sorry to laugh , kid -- I all 'm just very happy to see you midoriya so serious about this , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says , seating himself again . <div class="bookquote">`` Okay , back to business .

You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya says . <div class="bookquote">`` But I 've already diverged from all of that . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` True , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the former avatar agrees . <div class="bookquote">`` You 're making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that 's okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might all .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You ca n't dwell on that , Midoriya midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man says softly . <div class="bookquote">`` You 're a unique case . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya questions . <div class="bookquote">`` How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>All_Might all replies , shifting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perch . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scratches the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya_'s midoriya shoulder . <div class="bookquote">`` And -- er , this is n't for certain , but ... it may have also been my fault . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya tenses . What?


The avatar sighs . `` My fight with All For One did n't just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony harmony and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was ... crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could ` grant ' bending . I guess you could say he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It 's faint -- a slight hesitancy to All_Might_'s all words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya_'s midoriya stomach .


<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) afraid ?


<p/>In an instant , All_Might all suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead .


<p/>Is this what 's in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shudders as All_Might all begins to speak again .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but ... All For One wanted me to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to the Spirit World , regardless . And he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was going to do it by force . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` So ... you were n't just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony harmony , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya says . <div class="bookquote">`` You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All_Might all nods . <div class="bookquote">`` And what a fight it all was . It all took everything I had to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at bay . I 'm guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State the . No small feat , but it the worked and I almost had him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) finished . But then I got hit . ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) concealed wound . <div class="bookquote">`` I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya furrows his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) midoriya brow . <div class="bookquote">`` But ... sustaining injuries in the_Avatar_State the is n't enough to end the_Cycle the . Or block energy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` You 're right , the injury itself midoriya was n't what did it midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man replies , with a hint of ... embarrassment ?

So I went out of the_State the for the rest of the fight . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya_'s midoriya head .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) states . <div class="bookquote">`` And ashamed that you left the_State the , even though staying in it the could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All_Might all blinks . <div class="bookquote">`` Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya flushes , waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya hands in apology . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh , I 'm so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` No , my boy , it 's fine . ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>All_Might all gives him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya a small smile . <div class="bookquote">`` Butting your midoriya head into other people 's business is the mark of a good avatar . And it 's good to see you midoriya already know about your midoriya chakras -- those are important . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The blood does n't leave Midoriya_'s midoriya face , and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya squeaks out a thank you midoriya .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` So yes , like you midoriya said , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all starts again slowly . <div class="bookquote">`` I did n't resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` But why would that block all of my bending ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya questions .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well -- my theory is that I did n't just have one chakra clogged . ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man raises his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand and points an index finger at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead . <div class="bookquote">`` Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` And you think that carried over into my chakras , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya concludes .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I 'll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ` spiritual aspect ' as some of the former avatars . So I do n't know if my running theory actually works , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says . <div class="bookquote">`` And while I 've come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So that 's what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya midoriya thinks . But what kind of disconnect ...


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` But what 's important is that you 're here now and you 've already bended two elements , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says , interrupting Midoriya_'s midoriya thoughts . <div class="bookquote">`` You 've also attempted water and fire , correct ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya nods . <div class="bookquote">`` But I was n't able to do either . I ca n't really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't rush it , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all advises . <div class="bookquote">`` You 've only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks Midoriya midoriya up and down . <div class="bookquote">`` And I feel like yours will be , as well . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` How can you tell ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All Might tents his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands , fingertips on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips . <div class="bookquote">`` You 'll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are ... Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya_'s midoriya brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) midoriya shoves down immediately .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya feel as though you 've only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) midoriya continues . <div class="bookquote">`` And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who 's always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The knowing look All_Might all gives Midoriya midoriya tells him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) midoriya that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) midoriya knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya midoriya returns a nervous smile .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya must look confused , because the former avatar sighs .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All_Might all says . <div class="bookquote">`` While I all am here to give you advice , I all am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Your hardships and battles will be different than mine all . You can not copy me all -- that 'll only end in tragedy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya gazes up at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya predecessor , the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya words settling on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya shoulders .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya can save the world , but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya might not be able to save himself midoriya .


<p/>The nod of understanding he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya gives feels like the click of a lock on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya heart . There 's no backing out ; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya fate is intertwined with that of the world .


<p/>All_Might all responds with a grim smile .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` So tell me all , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man says , rising and turning to thread his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya midoriya begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flicker out like a lightbulb . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's once again in that black void , nothing but him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) , darkness , and the boom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mentor 's voice .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` What are you going to do ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trains like hell .


<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's going to train under anyone , he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs to make sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bones do n't shatter first .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediate goal : fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plans for the future , fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body , and fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind .


<p/>Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei yuuei entrance exam .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's been doing this for years -- fragmenting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future by compartmentalizing it . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 'll still have to save the world someday , but for now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just has to focus on getting into Yuuei yuuei .


<p/>As to why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) 's so dead set on Yuuei yuuei ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling .


<p/>Simply put , it feels like fate .


<p/>-LRB- Midoriya midoriya ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB-


<p/>But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might all has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars .


<p/>So Yuuei it is .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya house . Anywhere where no one will stop him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya from practicing . When he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya 's not in school , he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya 's sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya and which ones do n't .


<p/>The internet helps him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya more than he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they 're abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya midoriya finds himself midoriya compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya has a semblance of an actual workout schedule .


<p/>x


<p/>There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya midoriya can learn combat moves by himself midoriya by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya ca n't figure out how to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya power . He (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) midoriya has a set limit , but honestly , it 's not enough .


<p/>But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide .


<p/>So Midoriya midoriya finds himself midoriya back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya pitches his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya idea to All Might : teach Midoriya midoriya the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya pass the exam .


<p/>The proposition brings a smile to All_Might_'s all face . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya_'s midoriya head .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't worry , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya assures . <div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya have just the move in mind . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>x


<p/>It 's backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might all .


<p/>School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya midoriya hardly notices .


<p/>Of course there are moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) doubts what he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's doing -- is Yuuei yuuei actually worth this ? He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's the avatar -- ca n't he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) put off the hellish training until later ? He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ?


<p/>But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya midoriya is painfully reminded that this is him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) catching up . That what he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience .


<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) wants to train with the best , he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) has to put himself on equal footing first -- his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) spiritual title does not give him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) to a free ride to Yuuei .


<p/>So despite his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) doubts , despite his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) fatigue , he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) pushes forward . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) sees results .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) 's sturdier , in mind and in body . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) has an artillery of combat actions at his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) disposal . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) power output .


<p/>When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya midoriya actually feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya 's standing at the starting line .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya shuffles past the Yuuei yuuei gates , his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya throat in his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya stomach and his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya legs trembling .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya did n't know at all , and a couple more he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya was hesitant about , but it seems likely he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya scored well .


<p/>Now comes the tough part .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya 's forcing himself midoriya to be calm , clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya closes his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya eyes .


<p/>The worst that can happen is he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya has to go to another bending school . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya 's prepared for this . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya 's done as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya can . It 's all a matter of showing that work now .


<p/>Slightly calmer , Midoriya_'s midoriya eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya face and he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya takes a big step forward --


<p/>Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya topples but his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya mind stays strangely clear .


<p/>Of course , his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You would n't be Midoriya Izuku if you did n't pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid.


<p/>Right before he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there 's a whoosh and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya is n't falling .


<p/>In fact , he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya 's floating .


<p/>Midoriya_'s midoriya eyes go wide and he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya upwards , bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya from 20 to 90 . His (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya midoriya turns to find his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya savior .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Are you okay ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div>A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya , arms still raised from bending . Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) big brown eyes look him (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya up and down , questioning and caring .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya merely stares .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Sorry for not asking before using my midoriya bending on you midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continues , shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hip . <div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tilts her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and beams .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya feels himself midoriya nearly go into cardiac arrest .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Uh , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya eloquently responds .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , we better get inside -- they 're starting soon . I 'm so nervous ! But let 's both do our best , okay ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Um , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya tries again .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Good luck ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says , turning to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way across the courtyard . Only his (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya eyes follow , watching the swish of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yellow skirt as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya does n't think of how mortifying that was . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya does n't think of how experienced the benders he (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya 's up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya does n't even think about the dreaded exam .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>mentor</b></font>) midoriya brain simply spits out :


<p/>I talked to a girl !


<p/>Midoriya midoriya stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) midoriya shoulder .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Get moving , shitty Deku , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they growl .


<p/>It pulls him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) midoriya out of his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) midoriya reverie ; he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) midoriya jumps at the sight of Kacchan 's red glare boring into him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) midoriya -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors .


<p/>No taunting . No teasing . Nothing .


<p/>It 's true that Bakugou bakugou had been a lot more reserved following the ... incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya midoriya spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou bakugou seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bakugou ashamed ? Angry ?


<p/>Either way , Midoriya midoriya finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou bakugou is plotting something .


<p/>-LRB- Or that Bakugou bakugou thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bakugou 's plotting something . -RRB-


<p/>Midoriya midoriya tries to wipe that unease from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya mind , changing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya thoughts to the task ahead . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya sighs , then follows his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya neighbor through those daunting doors .


<p/>They 're greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya midoriya would like .


<p/>The silence from Bakugou bakugou is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other 's presence .


<p/>The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya finds himself midoriya in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya stomach as he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya thinking ? He (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself midoriya a spot in the top bending school in the city ?


<p/>Stupid, stupid, stupid.


<p/>Midoriya midoriya nervously adjusts the green armband on his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya needs to keep it that way .


<p/>If people find out that he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya 's the avatar , they also find out that All_Might all is dead . The fragile peace that All_Might_'s all image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya 's forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar was n't even able to bend up until 10 months ago .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya might consider telling some of the Yuuei yuuei staff if he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it 's essential that he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya keep this secret until he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya 's mastered Earth at least .


<p/>Of course , he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya has to get into Yuuei yuuei first .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya thoughts are interrupted when he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) midoriya notices what appears to be their instructor .


<p/>A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya glances at some papers laid out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya uses one hand to slick his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya notes .


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya 's done , he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya looks up , smiles , and then shouts .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` HOW 'S IT GOIN ' , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The students</b></font>)</div><p/>The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud .


<p/>The_man midoriya glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya mouth away from the mic .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` What -- you want me to ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya gestures at the mic , then at himself midoriya . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that 's cool . That 's fair . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya steps away from the podium , then starts again .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you 're ready to TEST ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) midoriya mouth .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` That 's -- that 's Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya whispers excitedly . <div class="bookquote">`` Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bakugou bakugou growls . Midoriya midoriya shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya mouth .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Let 's get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei yuuei is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting 's active use in careers , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yamada says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya , in turn , raises two fingers . <div class="bookquote">`` That 's why we 'll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/># 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yamada explains . <div class="bookquote">`` We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya looks down at the table in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya . Yeah , he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 's been working on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya power output through his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya sessions with All_Might all , but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya is n't sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 'll just have to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya best .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yamada says , almost as a side-note . <div class="bookquote">`` There 's sheer power , there 's technical power -- we do n't care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/># 2 : Combat .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` And here 's the fun part -- the combat , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the_man midoriya says with a devious grin . Midoriya midoriya gulps .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yamada says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` We 've assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div><p/>A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Now , just beating the other team is n't gon na be enough to pass , of course . We 're grading you on a multitude of other things . But I 'll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You do n't want to be a bystander for this test . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` You 'll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yamada says . <div class="bookquote">`` But for now : go show us some power ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>the students</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) following wink rallies the students ; there 's a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya competition now dawning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>x


<p/>They 're broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya and Bakugou bakugou are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya does n't bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya does n't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya stomach could take it .


<p/>It 's a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya edges his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya nervousness by observing other students ' tests . As he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You midoriya made it ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>savior</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya looks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya left to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya midoriya is n't sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 's happy or sad about that . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya fidgets .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` U-uh . Yep ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returns not making it all the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes . She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be nervous , too .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Well , good luck ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Without another word , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes back to watching the field .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya is grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not wanting to small-talk -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya would puke .


<p/>The_proctor the makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) the way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . <div class="bookquote">`` All right , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) the begins . <div class="bookquote">`` First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div><p/>A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band .


<p/>They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both .


<p/>Whereas Midoriya midoriya had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>leagues</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high .


<p/>But the test that catches everyone 's attention is a boy with strange white and red hair .


<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya takes to the field , something about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya seems familiar -- his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya hair ? The dignity he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya carries himself midoriya with ? Midoriya midoriya ca n't see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya face , but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya knows he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya 's seen this kid before .


<p/>The_examinee midoriya seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya 's given the go ahead , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya swirls his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged .


<p/>The boy 's palms spark .


<p/>With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya flinches .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique .


<p/>The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya midoriya spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left eye and things click together .


<p/>A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending .


<p/>That 's ... .


<p/>That 's ... .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Hey , um , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the airbender girl</b></font>)</div>the airbender girl says from beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) . <div class="bookquote">`` You 're kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y know . The_Firelord_'s the son . The one that hates staring . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>At the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) . Midoriya midoriya snaps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya trance , jerking to attention and whipping his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` W-was I ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki todoroki . <div class="bookquote">`` Haha , oops ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought to be ashamed , and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aims to be a top bender , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya gages it 's been long enough , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya shyly peeks at the prince again .


<p/>Todoroki_'s todoroki mismatched eyes are still trained on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya , the quiet intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya gaze making Midoriya midoriya fidget . It feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya 's being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya skin and paging through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya weaknesses and secrets .


<p/>It 's scary .


<p/>The prince finally looks away and Midoriya midoriya releases a breath he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya did n't know he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya was holding .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Can I go ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the test proctor</b></font>)</div>Todoroki todoroki asks , turning to the test proctor . <div class="bookquote">`` I todoroki 've done my todoroki required testing . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` I todoroki 'm afraid not , Your Highness , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the_proctor the says . <div class="bookquote">`` You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I the 'm sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Todoroki todoroki sighs , then calmly moves his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) before stepping up to test .


<p/>The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the_Firelord_'s the son .


<p/>What happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ? What must his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) home life be like , to make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that cold ?


<p/>But Midoriya midoriya is brought back to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya has to go up against that .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya twitches in place as the_proctor the tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` That concludes the recommendee testing , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the_proctor the says . <div class="bookquote">`` Now we 'll move on to standard testing -- and I the must remind recommendees that they 're to stay put for this portion , as well . ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a shy smile , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor the announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air .


<p/>The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya midoriya on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field .


<p/>When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya midoriya starts feeling intimidated .


<p/>Yes , Midoriya midoriya has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sees on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya midoriya feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was horribly unprepared for .


<p/>But All_Might_'s all advice comes to mind .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you midoriya 're fixated on , he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) remembers All Might telling him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) one session when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was getting particularly frustrated with the move .


<p/>Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power .


<p/>No , power in bending comes from the strength of your midoriya own internal energy -- your midoriya body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your midoriya main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you midoriya push it into the elements .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya breathes deeply . Focus on himself midoriya . Focus on doing the move right . He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya almost does n't notice the test in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya has finished .


<p/>The_proctor the pauses for a moment before reading the next name .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya midoriya Izuku . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya jumps at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya name , then begins to edge his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya way through the crowd with slumped shoulders .


<p/>The prolonged look the_proctor the gives him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya feels too significant to ignore -- does he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya swallows hard , then assumes his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya power stance .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya gazes down at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya hands , trying to calm his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya heartbeat and praying he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) midoriya 's not about to do something that is n't earthbending .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Whenever you 're ready , Midoriya midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the_proctor the says , making the boy flinch .


<p/>Okay , Midoriya midoriya : remember your training . You worked with All_Might all on this -- you should have this in the bag . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya shifts , steadying his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya feet and shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya weight into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya heels . This is the easy part .


<p/>A deep breath .


<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya begins .


<p/>The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya midoriya moves his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya arms upwards from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya core and out in a circle . His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya hands meet at the top ; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya calmly lowers them , clasped over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya heart .


<p/>Draw power from your core , he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya hears All Might say . Bring your heart 's energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya imagines that energy transfer , sees his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya power bleed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya chest and into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya hands .


<p/>Down and steady , my boy .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below .


<p/>And Now!


<p/>Midoriya midoriya thrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya breaks stance , oddly drained after the display .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya cranes his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher .


<p/>But the important thing is that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya actually did it .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya actually correctly did the move All_Might all taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya exits the bending zone with a small smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya performed well on one half of the practical . He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats .


Hey.


It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya midoriya turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) midoriya flinches when he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) midoriya sees it 's none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto todoroki .


<p/>-LRB- Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) midoriya supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) midoriya shoes ? Oh god what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) midoriya supposed to do . -RRB-


<p/>Midoriya midoriya instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki todoroki must be used to awed silence -- he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) midoriya speaks in Midoriya_'s midoriya stead .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` That was an All Might specialty move , ''  (<font color='red'><b>prince</b></font>)</div>the prince states , unwavering .


Um. Y-yes ? '' Midoriya midoriya says .


<p/>Todoroki todoroki does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya midoriya mentally slaps himself for forgetting .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . <div class="bookquote">`` I admired -- ''


 (<font color='red'><b>Todoroki</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Do n't call me that , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Todoroki</b></font>)</div>Todoroki todoroki objects . Please. I ca n't stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . ''


<p/>Midoriya midoriya reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir did n't get along with the_Firelord the , but to be so open about it the ... .


<p/>Todoroki_Shouto todoroki must truly not care about family image .


Okay. Todoroki todoroki , '' Midoriya midoriya stammers . <div class="bookquote">`` But , um , yes , I admired All_Might all a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bending tricks from watching his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) matches . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Todoroki todoroki says without missing a beat . <div class="bookquote">`` It 's supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya midoriya ? God , it 's boiling .


<p/>Haha , I 'm so dead .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I. Well . Hm , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya stammers , pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) midoriya collar and cringing under Todoroki_'s todoroki steady gaze . <div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya guess ... I midoriya 'm just a quick learner ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Todoroki todoroki does n't move and Midoriya_'s midoriya eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) midoriya skin being peeled back by the prince 's gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) midoriya skin being flayed . It takes all of his (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) midoriya willpower to avoid scampering off .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... Sure , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Todoroki</b></font>)</div>Todoroki todoroki says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) midoriya scans Midoriya midoriya one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya resists the urge to start hyperventilating .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) midoriya gets the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>learner</b></font>) midoriya just had a very close call , even though there 's no way in hell that Todoroki todoroki could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) midoriya . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) cover -- that , and Midoriya_'s midoriya horrendous ability to keep secrets .


<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya actually gets into Yuuei yuuei , he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya 'll have to watch himself midoriya around the heir .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It 's one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya mind and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya finds himself midoriya both intimidated and inspired .


<p/>This is what he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya could be if he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya gets into Yuuei yuuei .


<p/>This is the power he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya could practice beside , the people he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya could befriend .


<p/>-LRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya back . -RRB-


<p/>When the final test is complete , the_proctor the calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya stomach .


<p/>x


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it 's simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya needs to dress fast but taking his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya time regardless . How many times has he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ?


<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya finds he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya ca n't get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high .


<p/>The rules of the match echo through his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya head as he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya pulls off his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) midoriya own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` This wo n't be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya_'s midoriya future .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Instead , it 's one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya midoriya yanks them on and wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya had asked for a size up . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 's grown more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya had .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` The bare minimum to pass is KO'ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya shrugs the thick padding on over his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya shoulders , yanks the green sash around his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya head . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` You 'll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The lights of the arena are blinding ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya squints as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya stumbles his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya way into the ring . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya pays no mind to his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya teammates , solely focused on calming himself midoriya down before the match .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` If you fall out of the ring , you fail . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya closes his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya eyes and inhales deeply . This is it .


<p/>Some voice in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya head prompts him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya to wonder how Bakugou bakugou is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about bakugou he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 's thinking about , there 's no reason to be worried .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya needs to focus on himself midoriya .


Hi again!


Midoriya midoriya jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya thoughts , then flushes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya spots the speaker : pixie bob girl .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Looks like we 're on the same team , huh ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya midoriya , then the other two team members behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya . <div class="bookquote">`` The other two do n't seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya and the firebender was a little zoned out . I do n't think they 're into the whole teamwork thing , y know ? ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`` Uh-huyeah , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya says , internally slapping himself midoriya for the mix of gibberish he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya ca n't help but spew .


<p/>Luckily , the girl does n't seem to mind . Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) 's used to it . <div class="bookquote">`` Oh well , I guess we 'll just have to watch each others ' backs . I 'm Uraraka uraraka , by the way ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Uraraka uraraka : bright , beautiful . How fitting.


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` M-Midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya replies .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Nice to meet ya , Midoriya midoriya ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drops her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) helmet on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head , gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya to the middle line .


<p/>Well , at least that 's one advantage . Uraraka uraraka seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending is n't terribly offensive , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) 'll still cover for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) uraraka .


<p/>It 's a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) uraraka joins his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) uraraka team at the start point .


<p/>The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) ears . Not that it matters -- he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) opponents and teammates .


<p/>The other team is just as terrifying as he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) anticipated . He (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) 's not sure if they 're Yuuei students or hired benders , but they 're older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) team is ... not quite so confident . Like Uraraka uraraka said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous .


<p/>But the face that scares him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) the most is Uraraka_'s uraraka . Gone is her (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) uraraka cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) sees is icy willpower . Her (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) uraraka eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces .


<p/>This girl means business .


<p/>Rather than put him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) at ease , it disorients him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) further -- he (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) 's not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) uraraka steals points from him (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) ?


<p/>Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He (<font color='blue'><b>referee</b></font>) scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand .


<p/>There 's literally no logic in Uraraka uraraka trying to beat you ! You 're on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you 'll get enough points anyway , you 've done the work and --


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` -- riya ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) startles , whipping around to see Uraraka uraraka shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` They 're about to start ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) stumbles into Zone_1 1 and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya midoriya looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... 2 , 1 : GO . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) does n't even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) stomach , sending him (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 2 . He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) wheezes a curse under his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) breath and then hauls himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) feet , scanning the scene ahead .


<p/>The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it 's already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) 's already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka uraraka is cartwheeling across Zone_1 1 to avoid fire blasts .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya realizes .


<p/>Wait.


<p/>... Where 's their waterbender ?


<p/>The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya lands on his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya butt but then uses his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya ground contact to his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya hands , which he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it does n't offer as much protection as he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya 'd like , but it 's all that he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya 's got .


<p/>The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya peeks from around the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet .


<p/>Okay -- he (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya to score a point . But how?


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya team 's waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) 'll be off the back .


<p/>Time for a risk .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya waits for a water-free moment , then flings his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya shield as hard as possible at the airbender .


<p/>It does n't connect , but it disorients her (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) ; taking advantage of the distraction , his (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) midoriya team 's waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) dead-on . She (<font color='blue'><b>ref</b></font>) soars to the back of the arena and over the edge .


<p/>Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya teeth , he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya leans into the stream so he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya 's on his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya hands and knees .


<p/>As soon as the water lets up , he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya 'll have to make this fast .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya keeps up the disk 's momentum with his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya arms , flinging the rock and his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya first point --


<p/>Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya and pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya into Zone_2 2 . Midoriya_'s midoriya disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya midoriya drops his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya arms and cranes his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya head to look at the water 's source .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya teammate , wheeling his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya arms and prepping another water blast , does n't even look at him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya as he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork .


<p/>-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya midoriya finds he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya ca n't be happy about it . -RRB-


<p/>A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left .


<p/>Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya still does n't have any points ! Whos even left to hit?


<p/>Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 's nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two .


<p/>Uraraka uraraka is now engaged with the earthbender -- she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 's struggling , but she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) 's staying put in Zone_1 1 . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 2 , looking to pick a fight .


<p/>Okay , there 's Midoriya_'s midoriya target .


<p/>The firebender , however , notices him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya first : she (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) volleys off a round of fireballs right at him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya 's forced to roll to the side . He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya pushes onto his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya 's only done defense so far -- but what else can he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya do ? How can he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya fight when the_enemy midoriya wo n't even let him (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya plant himself midoriya and utilize his (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya bending ?


<p/>Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka_'s uraraka fight , he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya 's going to get hit .


<p/>Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>teammate</b></font>) midoriya gets a distraction ... .


Uraraka! Midoriya midoriya shouts , praying that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) 'll be able to spare a moment . <div class="bookquote">`` Some air , please ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) jerks at her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) name , looking towards Midoriya midoriya and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) opponent . Her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) gaze jumps over his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) eyes . She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) nods .


<p/>Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) inhales deeply and holds .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya shifts his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya core to head back in the direction he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya came from .


<p/>Uraraka uraraka exhales and hell breaks loose .


<p/>Something resembling a tornado erupts from her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 3 to dodge it 3 .


<p/>Now! Now Midoriya midoriya can go for the hit . He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya plants himself midoriya , raising a disk .


<p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya can even aim it 3 , the wind catches up to the firebender . She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya stares , desperation clawing at his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya core .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` One hit ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya cries in frustration . <div class="bookquote">`` I midoriya just need one hit ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya looks dully at the scene ahead -- there 's just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka uraraka seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya again , if he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya 's still here .


<p/>Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it 's just him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya and Uraraka uraraka . But she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) 's more than capable -- if he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya tried to interfere , he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya 'd probably just mess her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) up .


<p/>There 's a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya midoriya whips around to see Uraraka uraraka pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team 's earthbender stalking over . He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) midoriya captive , the sharp motion making her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wheeze .


<p/>Midoriya_'s midoriya eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win .


<p/>However , if Uraraka uraraka gets knocked out of the ring and it 's just him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) uraraka and this other guy left ... Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker .


<p/>Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya midoriya wins .


<p/>But it also means that Uraraka uraraka fails .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya thrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya manages to stay upright .


<p/>Meanwhile , the_enemy midoriya is in position , arms pushing out from his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka_'s uraraka rock coffin hurtling towards the edge --


<p/>With a guttural yell , Midoriya midoriya slams both his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya , rocketing him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya away from Uraraka uraraka and towards the opposite edge .


<p/>The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya_'s midoriya arms and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya swears he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya can feel them fracture in at least five different places .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya arms become pure , unadulterated pain .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya collapses .


<p/>Everything seems hazy as he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya watches his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the_enemy midoriya emerge dirty but unscathed . The_man midoriya lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya hands and Midoriya midoriya feels a disk slide under him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya and two disks rise to box him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya arms .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya ca n't move .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya surroundings are shifting ; he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya 's speeding towards the edge and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya 's accepted that there 's nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya can do , that his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya exam is over .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below --


<p/>But gravity never kicks in .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya realizes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya lolls his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya head to the side and spots Uraraka uraraka , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen .


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) adds her (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) left arm to the movement , circling her (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya midoriya feels himself midoriya begin to drift back .


<p/>When the ground is finally below him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya , Uraraka uraraka stops bending . Midoriya midoriya drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) midoriya eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes --


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Aaaaaand your exam is over ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Yamada</b></font>)</div>Yamada yells over the intercom .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya blinks .


<p/>All that training . All that work . And:


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I got one hit . Just one hit , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Midoriya midoriya moans , dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya head to the ground . <div class="bookquote">`` What kind of a bender am I ... ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There 's something wet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya cheek and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya closes his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya arms . It seeps into his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya brain , clouding his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya thoughts , and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya fights to stay awake .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya to the healers , now ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One hit .

<p/>The acrid smell of vomit reaches his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 's repeating one hit , why ... . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I failed .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya brain flickers off .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya does n't eat much those next few days .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya mother the only evidence that anything happened .


<p/>But the events of the exam plague his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya mind , looping over and over as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya tries to settle back into normalcy , as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya 's not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious .


<p/>Sure , he (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya stayed in the ring -- but no way that was enough to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) midoriya into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds .


<p/>Bakugou bakugou got in -- Midoriya midoriya does n't have to speculate on that . He (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) bakugou 's dreading seeing the smug look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) bakugou face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time .


<p/>Maybe Uraraka uraraka got in . Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Yamada</b></font>) 'll remember that silly earthbending kid that could n't even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou can learn from .


<p/>But it feels wrong -- it feels like he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou should be following in All Might 's steps and learning at Yuuei yuuei .


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou supposed to be great if he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou is n't learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bakugou have made with the four nation 's up and coming leaders -- like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou made those connections early ?


<p/>Midoriya midoriya thinks of Todoroki 's empty , calculating eyes and shudders .


<p/>True , the_prince bakugou did n't seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei yuuei would have been a good start .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya is trapped in a cycle of misery -- thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou mother , the saint that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is , has allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou to mope for the week , only prompting him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) 's let him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou be . She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw it coming and understands that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou needs time to come to terms .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou does n't respond when his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou mom announces she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) 's going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou knows .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` I-Izuku ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . <div class="bookquote">`` It 's here ! ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Midoriya midoriya simply stares at the black lettering for a moment .


<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) hand and walking to his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou room . The door closes behind him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou with a resolute click and he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou takes a deep breath .


<p/>Welp , this is it .


<p/>Here is the confirmation that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou needs a new plan .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou sits at his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou fears and he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou hungrily begins to read .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Midoriya_Izuku midoriya , ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it midoriya begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . <div class="bookquote">`` The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score .


<p/>The written exam is what he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou expected : he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin .


<p/>The power score is actually better than he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score .


<p/>But the combat column is where he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou trembles . The <div class="bookquote">`` 1 ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>draws his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou eyes in like a magnet , confirming his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou fears .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou did n't score nearly high enough to get in .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou 's toast .


<p/>Resigned , he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou lets his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Welcome to Yuuei . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou eyes skim over the words , then he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou double-takes . He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou backtracks and reads it again .


<p/>It stays the same : <div class="bookquote">`` Welcome to Yuuei . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This has to be some sort of mistake . He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou has to call them , to tell them they sent him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou the wrong letter .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) bakugou eye .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) wanted to share points with me ?


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>... Teamwork and cooperation ?


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping <div class="bookquote">`` 59 ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>under it sharply contrasts the <div class="bookquote">`` 1 ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the hits category .


<p/>It 's not a mistake .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ...


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) actually got into Yuuei .


<p/>A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya midoriya finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does n't care . It 's not until he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) starts crying in earnest that his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in .


<p/>Of course his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) first instinct is to tell All_Might all .


<p/>The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) worldly contacts . But Midoriya midoriya wants to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in person regardless , to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 'll admit -- All_Might all does n't seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 's a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya midoriya lacks in the waking world .


<p/>-LRB- Maybe All_Might all is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB-


<p/>When Midoriya midoriya clambers into bed that night , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows what to do . With his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) headphones playing a soft song for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lays flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) forces his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart to slow , makes himself ease his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) limbs melt into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bed .


<p/>The music from his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) into the unknown .


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) opens his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes again , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 's not in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) familiar forest .


<p/>It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya midoriya can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) 's grown to know .


<p/>The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) throat .


<p/>Midoriya midoriya crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya chest and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya ca n't say why , but something in the dust feels ... alive ? Tormented ?


<p/>Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya has to help , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya ca n't just leave them --


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya hand brushes something solid and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya halts for a moment . Then he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya horror , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya realizes that it 's a hand .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya falls backwards on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison .


<p/>Several things happen at once .


<p/>The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya midoriya in sheets , invading his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya clothes , his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya eyes , his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya throat . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya chokes -- more accurately , he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya drowns .


<p/>The hand closes the gap , crawling over his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya foot and clamping onto his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya ankle . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya wastes air and yelps , flailing his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya energy wanes ; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya sinks , head hitting the ground . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya can only watch the thing with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya eyes , unable to escape .


<p/>It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya_'s midoriya blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body .


<p/>The mass climbs its way up his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya_'s midoriya . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya tries to jerk his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya face away but finds that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya ca n't .


<p/>I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold .


<p/>Midoriya_'s midoriya eyes widen ; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya reaches at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya last scraps of energy and renews his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya throat . He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) midoriya lets out a weak wheeze of agony .


<p/>The thing leans in , almost brushing Midoriya_'s midoriya nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya_'s midoriya spine .


<p/>It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya midoriya imagines it would be smiling .


<p/>You think you 're safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice .


<p/>Midoriya_'s midoriya head lulls , his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya body .


<p/>How naive.


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya eyes are closed and he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya 's barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear .


<p/>You obviously have no idea what 's coming .


<p/>Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya_'s midoriya armpits , yanking him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya under the mound of dust and into the earth . He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya swallows dust and sees no more .


<p/>x


<p/>A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya_'s midoriya throat as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya bolts upright .


<p/>Escape .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya has to escape .


<p/>There 's something confining his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya legs --


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya kicks his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya way out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya sheets , stumbling from his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya bed and tripping onto the floor .


<p/>The soft carpeting of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya from the walls .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya 's in the real world .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya 's safe .


<p/>Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face .


Izuku! What happened?


Midoriya midoriya ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya chest , then another .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya 's cried in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya mom before . This midoriya is n't new .


<p/>But it midoriya feels different -- it midoriya 's embarrassing . He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya 's supposed to hold up the whole world but he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya ca n't even hold himself midoriya together .


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya drops his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya face in his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya hands .


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya in a comforting embrace .


<p/><div class="bookquote">`` There there , Izuku , ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya back . <div class="bookquote">`` It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . ''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it wo n't . And he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya wo n't .


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ?


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ?


<p/>What is that thing ? What is it plotting ?


<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya supposed to stop it ?


<p/>In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya back and he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya collapses under it , clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) midoriya mother and soaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that :


<p/>A boy .
