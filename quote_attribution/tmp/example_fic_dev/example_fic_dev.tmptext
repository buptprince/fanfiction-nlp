But despite the house arrest , Midoriya midoriya can t help but smile . His izuku mom seems pretty excited , too -- she witnessed his izuku rock firsthand , and although she can t entirely grasp how it took Izuku izuku fourteen years to figure out bending , she s ecstatic for her son . 


She bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time . 


Oh , I m so excited for you , Izuku izuku ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I m going to make you a cake . And I ll call your father -- oh ! He ll be so surprised ! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats -- 


Mom . Mom -- thank you . I m happy you re excited , too , Midoriya midoriya interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He midoriya smiles warmly . But seriously , you don t have to make me a cake . I kind of just want to go to bed right now , I m beat . 


She blinks , then beams back at him midoriya . Oh , of course ! It s been quite the day for you -- I should have figured you d want to sleep . 


She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her son . Standing on tiptoes , she deposits a kiss on Midoriya midoriya s forehead . 


I m very proud of you , she says softly . You never gave up , did you ? 


He midoriya smiles , then shakes his midoriya head slowly . She holds his midoriya shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her eyes . 


He midoriya kisses her forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his midoriya bedroom . 


Night , Mom . 


Goodnight , Izuku izuku . 


The door closes behind him midoriya and he midoriya plops onto his midoriya bed , dwelling on what a day it s been . 


How could his midoriya life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he midoriya have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ? 


Midoriya midoriya flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him midoriya . 


He midoriya needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World the to talk to All Might and figure out his midoriya plan , pronto . 


The only method he midoriya knows of is sleep -- when he midoriya falls asleep , he midoriya should be able to go there . 


So he midoriya tries . He midoriya lays on his midoriya bed , staring blankly at the ceiling . 


This should be easy -- he midoriya 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the_Spirit_World the , so he midoriya should be able to cross over with no problem . He midoriya just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm . 


But as he midoriya gazes upwards and tries to clear his midoriya thoughts , muffled worries cloud his midoriya mind . 


Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ? 


Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice . 


What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ? 


The_Spirit_World the slips from his the grasp and he the shifts to his the side with a weary sigh , resigning himself the to a restless sleep . 


x


There s no school the next day and his the mom leaves the house telling him the to stay put and rest -- but the second she closes the door behind her , he the pulls on a jacket and slides on his the shoes . 


He the s not well , but he the can t rest easy until he the knows the full extent of his the bending abilities . He the has to see if he the can bend more than just earth and air . 


Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya midoriya comes to a stop . His midoriya head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his midoriya senses slightly , but overall he midoriya feels much more focused and refreshed . He midoriya uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away . 


First up : waterbending . 


He midoriya mimics the movements he midoriya sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles . 


But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he midoriya can t figure out how to transfer his midoriya energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending . 


He midoriya tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh . 


Okay , now for the one he midoriya has even less hope with : firebending . 


It s the same deal as waterbending ; he midoriya goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya midoriya can t tap into it . 


Sure , he midoriya s got fight in him midoriya . 


But he midoriya can t seem to draw it out in the form of fire . 


He midoriya treks back home , disappointed but not surprised . 


All that s left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers . 


x


He midoriya tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him midoriya cross over . 


But nothing works . He midoriya always begins to think of his midoriya troubles , to worry about the path ahead . 


It s a cycle -- his midoriya anxiety means he midoriya can t make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him midoriya even more anxiety . It s excessively stupid and he midoriya knows that he midoriya needs to calm down , to let his midoriya worries go . 


But he midoriya can t. That s not in his midoriya nature . 


It s after another failed attempt that Midoriya midoriya hoists himself midoriya , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He midoriya goes to sit at his midoriya desk , head in his midoriya hands , staring at the wood grain below . 


He midoriya s beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All Might was a fever dream , that he midoriya s the avatar but he midoriya never actually had that discussion with his midoriya predecessor . 


Why is he midoriya so bad at this ? Wasn t this supposed to come naturally ? 


He midoriya stares at the desk for another second , then raises his midoriya head . Reaching for his midoriya laptop , he midoriya flips it open and frantically types . 


avatar life biographies 


It s a dumb Google search , he midoriya knows . But he midoriya needs to know that he midoriya s not alone , that what he midoriya s going through is normal . 


He midoriya clicks the first link and begins to read . 


An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that didn t master all the elements until she was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult . 


The story that comforts him midoriya the most is All Might s. 


Avatar_Toshinori toshinori was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World the until he toshinori was eighteen , the article reads . When asked about the most difficult part of his toshinori journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he toshinori responded with : the spiritual aspect . 


Midoriya midoriya stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his midoriya face . 


He midoriya s not alone . He midoriya s never been alone . His midoriya struggle has been going on for centuries , and he midoriya s far from the first avatar to not know what to do . 


Even when a deep tiredness settles into his midoriya bones , he midoriya continues to scroll through his midoriya past lives . 


He midoriya feels connected . 


When he midoriya begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there s something like a humming that leaks into his midoriya ears . He midoriya lets his midoriya eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him midoriya , filling his midoriya ears and sinking into his midoriya limbs . 


He midoriya lets it engulf him midoriya . 


x


He midoriya can sense the difference before his midoriya eyes even flick open . 


The air around him midoriya feels lighter , the ache of his midoriya limbs fading and the weight of his midoriya eyelids lessening . 


He midoriya blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen . 


A sense of panic settles in his midoriya core . 


All Might ? he midoriya questions quietly . Only silence greets him midoriya . Then it hits him midoriya . 


It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding . 


Something s wrong . 


Midoriya midoriya whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he midoriya 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He midoriya nervously scans , trying to find the source of his midoriya unease . 


A wave of something hits him midoriya , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he midoriya fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he midoriya sees it . 


Maybe it 's his midoriya imagination -- there s shifting on a tree 15 feet to his midoriya left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers 


A hand , but not attached to a body . 


He midoriya chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction . 


He midoriya runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him midoriya whole . Midoriya midoriya is no expert on the_Spirit_World the , but he midoriya knows that that is not supposed to be there . He midoriya wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible . 


The invading emotions slowly fade as he midoriya puts distance between him midoriya and the thing , to his midoriya relief . He midoriya slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his midoriya breath . 


But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he midoriya felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya midoriya straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he midoriya thinks is the right direction . 


It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he midoriya reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya midoriya merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his midoriya name somewhere to his midoriya left . 


He midoriya turns to see the former avatar , picking his midoriya way over tree roots towards him midoriya . 


Thank god . 


Midoriya midoriya walks over to meet him midoriya , the_man midoriya s presence putting him midoriya at ease . 


You haven t been here in a while , my boy , All_Might all says , clapping Midoriya midoriya on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he s only met once . Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? 


Midoriya midoriya shrinks . Yes It took me a bit to figure out how to get here , but I think I ve got it now . 


I m glad -- I ve got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . 


The_man midoriya gives him a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He seems relaxed , nonchalant . 


But something in his words bother Midoriya midoriya . He hesitates , then asks . 


What do you mean by trouble ? 


All_Might all freezes , like he s been caught in some secret act . It all feels weird , pressing his childhood hero to share information with him , but Midoriya midoriya stays firm , fixing his mentor with a questioning stare . 


He has to familiarize himself with his past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets . 


Something in Midoriya midoriya s look must tell All_Might all this ; he sighs . 


Well , I suppose you would ve learned sooner or later , anyhow , All_Might all says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him . Midoriya midoriya pauses , then walks over to sit . 


There s a moment of silence as All_Might all formulates what to say ; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead . Midoriya midoriya just watches his midoriya hands , letting the avatar think . 


The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya midoriya locks eyes with his mentor , now donning a grim expression . 


I ll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , All_Might all says , black eyes boring into Midoriya midoriya s. For both your world and mine . 


What What is it ? Midoriya midoriya asks hesitantly . 


All_Might all sighs . I wish that I knew , my boy . 


Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? 


All_Might all rises and stands in front of Midoriya midoriya , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless . 


There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World the . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . All Might scratches at the top of his head , staring off into the woods . They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand 


Midoriya midoriya shudders and All_Might all stops . 


Midoriya midoriya ? Did you see one of them ? 


The boy fidgets . Um, yes. He fiddles with his fingers , looking down at the ground . I thought I spotted a hand It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions 


All Might mutters curses under his breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya midoriya s shoulders . 


I m sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , he says , locking eyes with his successor . Don don t try to find out what it is . Not yet. 


Midoriya midoriya breathes sharply . But , All_Might all -- 


You re not ready to face off with whatever this is , he cuts Midoriya midoriya off . I understand you want to help , but for now the best thing you can do is lay low and train . You have a lot of missed time to make up for . 


He has a point -- what could Midoriya midoriya even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost . 


Don don t worry , All_Might all says . It hasn t done anything too villainous , as of yet . Plus , I have contacts in the_real_world_that_are_trying_to_find_its_source the . We ll know what it is , soon enough . 


Midoriya midoriya tenses at contacts , recalling what he came here to ask about . Uh , All Might , about the_real_world the 


You re not sure what you re supposed to be doing , right ? All_Might all responds . We re connected -- I can feel your confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand . 


The words stolen from his mouth , Midoriya midoriya freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He shrugs away from the avatar s grasp , rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace . 


I don t even know where to start , he mutters , hand on his chin as he walks back and forth . Do I just come out and announce it 


Midoriya midoriya . 


Or keep it quiet -- 


Breathe . 


Or just train in one element , or -- 


You re overthinking this , my boy . 


But am I ? Midoriya midoriya frantically shoots back , stopping in his midoriya tracks . 


All_Might all pauses , then belts out a laugh . 


It s contagious -- Midoriya midoriya can t help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh . 


They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya midoriya feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he still manages to put on a smile . 


He wasn t the most charismatic avatar for nothing , Midoriya midoriya guesses . 


I m sorry to laugh , kid -- I m just very happy to see you so serious about this , All_Might all says , seating himself again . Okay , back to business . You know the traditional path an avatar takes . 


Yes : you re told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , Midoriya midoriya says . But I ve already diverged from all of that . 


True , the former avatar agrees . You re making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that s okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . 


Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , Midoriya midoriya murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might all . 


You can t dwell on that , Midoriya midoriya , the man says softly . You re a unique case . 


What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? Midoriya midoriya questions . How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? 


Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , All Might replies , shifting on his perch . He scratches the top of his head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya midoriya s shoulder . And -- er , this isn t for certain , but it may have also been my fault . 


Midoriya midoriya tenses . What? 


The avatar sighs . My fight with All For One didn t just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well . 


All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony harmony and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the_Spirit_World the . 


He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could grant bending . I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . 


It s faint -- a slight hesitancy to All Might s words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya midoriya s stomach . 


Is he afraid ? 


In an instant , All_Might all suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead . 


Is this what s in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ? 


He shudders as All_Might all begins to speak again . 


Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World , regardless . And he was going to do it by force . 


So you weren t just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony harmony , Midoriya midoriya says . You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . 


All_Might all nods . And what a fight it all was . It all took everything I had to hold him at bay . I m guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State the . No small feat , but it worked and I almost had him finished . But then I got hit . He grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his concealed wound . I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . 


Midoriya midoriya furrows his midoriya brow . But sustaining injuries in the Avatar State isn t enough to end the_Cycle the . Or block energy . 


You re right , the injury itself wasn t what did it , the man replies , with a hint of embarrassment ? Shame ? But after taking that hit , I was I didn t know if I would win , and I didn t want to be the one to end the_Cycle the . So I went out of the_State the for the rest of the fight . 


A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya midoriya s head . 


You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , he states . And ashamed that you left the_State the , even though staying in it the could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . 


All_Might all blinks . Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . 


Midoriya midoriya flushes , waving his midoriya hands in apology . Oh , I m so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- 


No , my boy , it s fine . All_Might all gives him midoriya a small smile . Butting your head into other people s business is the mark of a good avatar . And it s good to see you already know about your chakras -- those are important . 


The blood doesn t leave Midoriya midoriya s face , and he midoriya squeaks out a thank you . 


So yes , like you said , All_Might all starts again slowly . I didn t resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . 


But why would that block all of my bending ? Midoriya midoriya questions . 


Well -- my theory is that I didn t just have one chakra clogged . The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead . Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . 


And you think that carried over into my chakras , Midoriya midoriya concludes . 


I ll say that I was never quite as good at the whole spiritual aspect as some of the former avatars . So I don t know if my running theory actually works , All_Might all says . And while I ve come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . 


So that s what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya midoriya thinks . But what kind of disconnect 


But what s important is that you re here now and you ve already bended two elements , All_Might all says , interrupting Midoriya midoriya s thoughts . You ve also attempted water and fire , correct ? 


Midoriya midoriya nods . But I wasn t able to do either . I can t really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . 


Don don t rush it , All_Might all advises . You ve only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . He looks Midoriya midoriya up and down . And I feel like yours will be , as well . 


How can you tell ? 


All Might tents his hands , fingertips on his lips . You ll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . 


Midoriya midoriya s brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he shoves down immediately . 


I feel as though you ve only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , he continues . And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who s always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . 


The knowing look All_Might all gives Midoriya midoriya tells him midoriya that he midoriya knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya midoriya returns a nervous smile . 


It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . 


Midoriya midoriya must look confused , because the former avatar sighs . 


The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , All_Might all says . While I am here to give you advice , I am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . 


The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real . 


Your hardships and battles will be different than mine . You can not copy me -- that ll only end in tragedy . 


Midoriya midoriya gazes up at his midoriya predecessor , the weight of his midoriya words settling on his midoriya shoulders . 


He midoriya can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him midoriya . 


He midoriya can save the world , but he midoriya might not be able to save himself midoriya . 


The nod of understanding he midoriya gives feels like the click of a lock on his midoriya heart . There s no backing out ; his midoriya fate is intertwined with that of the world . 


All_Might all responds with a grim smile . 


So tell me , the man says , rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya midoriya begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb . He s once again in that black void , nothing but him , darkness , and the boom of his mentor s voice . 


What are you going to do ? 


He trains like hell . 


If he 's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones do n't shatter first . 


His immediate goal : fortify his plans for the future , fortify his body , and fortify his mind . 


Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei yuuei entrance exam . 


He s been doing this for years -- fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it . He ll still have to save the world someday , but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei yuuei . 


As to why he 's so dead set on Yuuei yuuei ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling . 


Simply put , it feels like fate . 


-LRB- Midoriya midoriya ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his midoriya youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB- 


But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might all has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars . 


So Yuuei it is . 


His midoriya life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his midoriya house . Anywhere where no one will stop him midoriya from practicing . When he midoriya s not in school , he midoriya s sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him midoriya and which ones don t. 


The internet helps him midoriya more than he midoriya would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they re abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya midoriya finds himself midoriya compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he midoriya has a semblance of an actual workout schedule . 


x


There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya midoriya can learn combat moves by himself midoriya by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction . 


He midoriya can t figure out how to increase his midoriya power . He midoriya has a set limit , but honestly , it s not enough . 


But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his midoriya might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide . 


So Midoriya midoriya finds himself midoriya back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands . 


He midoriya pitches his midoriya idea to All Might : teach Midoriya midoriya the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him midoriya pass the exam . 


The proposition brings a smile to All Might s face . He midoriya beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya midoriya s head . 


Don don t worry , he midoriya assures . I have just the move in mind . 


x


It s backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might all . 


School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya midoriya hardly notices . 


Of course there are moments when he doubts what he s doing -- is Yuuei yuuei actually worth this ? He s the avatar -- can t he put off the hellish training until later ? He s going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ? 


But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya midoriya is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he s doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience . 


If he wants to train with the best , he has to put himself on equal footing first -- his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei . 


So despite his doubts , despite his fatigue , he pushes forward . He sees results . 


He s sturdier , in mind and in body . He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal . He has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his power output . 


When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya midoriya actually feels like he midoriya s standing at the starting line . 


Midoriya midoriya shuffles past the Yuuei yuuei gates , his midoriya throat in his midoriya stomach and his midoriya legs trembling . 


He midoriya did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he midoriya didn t know at all , and a couple more he midoriya was hesitant about , but it seems likely he midoriya scored well . 


Now comes the tough part . 


He midoriya s forcing himself midoriya to be calm , clasping his midoriya hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He midoriya closes his midoriya eyes . 


The worst that can happen is he midoriya has to go to another bending school . He midoriya s prepared for this . He midoriya s done as much as he midoriya can . It s all a matter of showing that work now . 


Slightly calmer , Midoriya midoriya s eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his midoriya face and he midoriya takes a big step forward -- 


Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement . 


He midoriya topples but his midoriya mind stays strangely clear . 


Of course , his midoriya brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You wouldn t be Midoriya Izuku if you didn t pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid. 


Right before he midoriya gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there s a whoosh and suddenly he midoriya isn t falling . 


In fact , he midoriya s floating . 


Midoriya midoriya s eyes go wide and he midoriya yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him midoriya upwards , bringing him midoriya from 20 to 90 . His midoriya feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya midoriya turns to find his midoriya savior . 


Are you okay ? A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him midoriya , arms still raised from bending . Her big brown eyes look him midoriya up and down , questioning and caring . 


Midoriya midoriya merely stares . 


Sorry for not asking before using my bending on you , she continues , shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip . I figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! 


She tilts her head and beams . 


Midoriya midoriya feels himself midoriya nearly go into cardiac arrest . 


Uh , he midoriya eloquently responds . 


Well , we better get inside -- they re starting soon . I m so nervous ! But let s both do our best , okay ? 


Um , he midoriya tries again . 


Good luck ! she says , turning to continue her way across the courtyard . Only his midoriya eyes follow , watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building . 


He midoriya doesn t think of how mortifying that was . He midoriya doesn t think of how experienced the benders he midoriya s up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He midoriya doesn t even think about the dreaded exam . 


His midoriya brain simply spits out : 


I talked to a girl ! 


Midoriya midoriya stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his midoriya shoulder . 


Get moving , shitty Deku , they growl . 


It pulls him midoriya out of his midoriya reverie ; he midoriya jumps at the sight of Kacchan s red glare boring into him midoriya -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors . 


No taunting . No teasing . Nothing . 


It s true that Bakugou bakugou had been a lot more reserved following the incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya midoriya spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou bakugou seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he midoriya ashamed ? Angry ? 


Either way , Midoriya midoriya finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou bakugou is plotting something . 


-LRB- Or that Bakugou bakugou thinks he midoriya s plotting something . -RRB- 


Midoriya midoriya tries to wipe that unease from his midoriya mind , changing his midoriya thoughts to the task ahead . He midoriya sighs , then follows his midoriya neighbor through those daunting doors . 


They re greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya midoriya would like . 


The silence from Bakugou bakugou is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other s presence . 


The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare . 


Midoriya midoriya finds himself midoriya in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his midoriya stomach as he midoriya watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him midoriya . 


What was he midoriya thinking ? He midoriya literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he midoriya to think that he midoriya could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself midoriya a spot in the top bending school in the city ? 


Stupid, stupid, stupid. 


Midoriya midoriya nervously adjusts the green armband on his midoriya forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender . 


He midoriya needs to keep it that way . 


If people find out that he midoriya s the avatar , they also find out that All_Might all is dead . The fragile peace that All Might s image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he midoriya s forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar wasn t even able to bend up until 10 months ago . 


He midoriya might consider telling some of the Yuuei yuuei staff if he midoriya actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it s essential that he midoriya keep this secret until he midoriya s mastered Earth at least . 


Of course , he midoriya has to get into Yuuei yuuei first . 


His midoriya thoughts are interrupted when he midoriya notices what appears to be their instructor . 


A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He midoriya glances at some papers laid out in front of him midoriya , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He midoriya uses one hand to slick his midoriya pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his midoriya notes . 


When he midoriya s done , he midoriya looks up , smiles , and then shouts . 


HOW S IT GOIN , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? 


The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud . 


The_man midoriya glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his midoriya mouth away from the mic . 


What -- you want me to ? He midoriya gestures at the mic , then at himself midoriya . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that s cool . That s fair . 


He midoriya steps away from the podium , then starts again . 


Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you re ready to TEST ! 


Midoriya midoriya gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his midoriya mouth . 


That s -- that s Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! he midoriya whispers excitedly . Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- 


Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , Bakugou bakugou growls . Midoriya midoriya shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his midoriya mouth . 


Let s get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei yuuei is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting s active use in careers , Yamada yamada says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him yamada as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He yamada , in turn , raises two fingers . That s why we ll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . 


# 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power . 


First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , Yamada yamada explains . We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . 


Midoriya midoriya looks down at the table in front of him midoriya . Yeah , he midoriya s been working on his midoriya power output through his midoriya sessions with All_Might all , but he midoriya isn t sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He midoriya ll just have to do his midoriya best . 


Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , Yamada yamada says , almost as a side-note . There s sheer power , there s technical power -- we don t care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . 


# 2 : Combat . 


And here s the fun part -- the combat , the_man midoriya says with a devious grin . Midoriya midoriya gulps . 


We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , Yamada yamada says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him yamada . We ve assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . 


A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another . 


Now , just beating the other team isn t gon na be enough to pass , of course . We re grading you on a multitude of other things . But I ll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You don t want to be a bystander for this test . 


You ll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , Yamada yamada says . But for now : go show us some power ! 


His yamada following wink rallies the students ; there s a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first . 


Midoriya midoriya follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his midoriya competition now dawning on him midoriya . 


x


They re broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He midoriya and Bakugou bakugou are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he midoriya doesn t bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he midoriya doesn t think his midoriya stomach could take it . 


It s a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line . 


He midoriya edges his midoriya way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his midoriya nervousness by observing other students tests . As he midoriya waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him midoriya . 


You made it ! 


Midoriya midoriya looks to his midoriya left to see his midoriya savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya midoriya isn t sure whether he midoriya s happy or sad about that . He midoriya fidgets . 


U-uh . Yep 


She looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes . She must be nervous , too . 


Well , good luck ! Without another word , she goes back to watching the field . 


Midoriya midoriya is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk -- he midoriya would puke . 


The proctor makes his way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . All right , he begins . First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . 


A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 


They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both . 


Whereas Midoriya midoriya had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him midoriya . 


Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high . 


But the test that catches everyone s attention is a boy with strange white and red hair . 


As he midoriya takes to the field , something about him midoriya seems familiar -- his midoriya hair ? The dignity he midoriya carries himself midoriya with ? Midoriya midoriya can t see his midoriya face , but he midoriya knows he midoriya s seen this kid before . 


The_examinee midoriya seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he midoriya s given the go ahead , he midoriya swirls his midoriya arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing . 


Midoriya midoriya ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged . 


The boy s palms spark . 


With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long . 


Midoriya midoriya flinches . 


His eyes finally drift down to the boy s armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you re try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 


The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It s not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya midoriya spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 


A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending . 


That s . 


That s . 


Hey , um , the airbender girl says from beside him . You re kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y know . The Firelord s son . The one that hates staring . 


At the sound of his name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him . Midoriya midoriya snaps out of his midoriya trance , jerking to attention and whipping his midoriya head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off . 


W-was I ? he midoriya nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki todoroki . Haha , oops 


The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she ought to be ashamed , and if she aims to be a top bender , she should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he midoriya gages it s been long enough , he midoriya shyly peeks at the prince again . 


Todoroki todoroki s mismatched eyes are still trained on him midoriya , the quiet intensity of his midoriya gaze making Midoriya midoriya fidget . It todoroki feels like he midoriya s being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his midoriya skin and paging through his midoriya weaknesses and secrets . 


It s scary . 


The prince finally looks away and Midoriya midoriya releases a breath he midoriya didn t know he midoriya was holding . 


Can I go ? Todoroki todoroki asks , turning to the test proctor . I ve done my required testing . 


I m afraid not , Your Highness , the proctor says . You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I m sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . 


Todoroki todoroki sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but doesn t apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 


The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord s son . 


What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 


But Midoriya midoriya is brought back to his midoriya current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He midoriya has to go up against that . 


He midoriya twitches in place as the proctor tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd . 


That concludes the recommendee testing , the proctor says . Now we ll move on to standard testing -- and I must remind recommendees that they re to stay put for this portion , as well . He midoriya glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd . 


Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . 


With a shy smile , he midoriya and the airbending girls part ways . The proctor announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 


The following displays aren t as intimidating as the recommendees , but they still put Midoriya midoriya on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 


When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya midoriya starts feeling intimidated . 


Yes , Midoriya midoriya has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he s still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya midoriya feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for . 


But All Might s advice comes to mind . 


Midoriya midoriya , there s a misconception about earthbending that you midoriya re fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 


Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 


No , power in bending comes from the strength of your midoriya own internal energy -- your midoriya body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your midoriya main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you midoriya push it into the elements . 


Midoriya midoriya breathes deeply . Focus on himself midoriya . Focus on doing the move right . He midoriya almost doesn t notice the test in front of him midoriya has finished . 


The proctor pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 


Midoriya_Izuku midoriya . 


He midoriya jumps at the sound of his midoriya name , then begins to edge his midoriya way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 


The prolonged look the proctor gives him midoriya feels too significant to ignore -- does he midoriya knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He midoriya swallows hard , then assumes his midoriya power stance . 


Midoriya midoriya gazes down at his midoriya hands , trying to calm his midoriya heartbeat and praying he midoriya s not about to do something that isn t earthbending . 


Whenever you re ready , Midoriya midoriya , the proctor says , making the boy flinch . 


Okay , Midoriya midoriya : remember your training . You worked with All_Might all on this -- you should have this in the bag . He shifts , steadying his feet and shifting his weight into his heels . This is the easy part . 


A deep breath . 


Then he begins . 


The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya midoriya moves his midoriya arms upwards from his midoriya core and out in a circle . His midoriya hands meet at the top ; he midoriya calmly lowers them , clasped over his midoriya heart . 


Draw power from your core , he midoriya hears All Might say . Bring your heart s energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground . 


Midoriya midoriya imagines that energy transfer , sees his midoriya power bleed out of his midoriya chest and into his midoriya hands . 


Down and steady , my boy . 


His midoriya hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below . 


And� Now! 


Midoriya midoriya thrusts his midoriya hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He midoriya holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he midoriya breaks stance , oddly drained after the display . 


He midoriya cranes his midoriya head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he midoriya s seen thus far -- it might even be higher . 


But the important thing is that he midoriya actually did it . 


He midoriya actually correctly did the move All_Might all taught him midoriya . 


He midoriya exits the bending zone with a small smile on his midoriya face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him midoriya feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he midoriya performed well on one half of the practical . He midoriya settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 


Hey. 


It s a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya midoriya turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn . 


He midoriya flinches when he midoriya sees it s none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto todoroki . 


-LRB- Is he midoriya supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his midoriya shoes ? Oh god what is he midoriya supposed to do . -RRB- 


Midoriya midoriya instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki todoroki must be used to awed silence -- he midoriya speaks in Midoriya midoriya s stead . 


That was an All Might specialty move , the prince states , unwavering . 


Um. Y-yes ? Midoriya midoriya says . 


Todoroki todoroki does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya midoriya mentally slaps himself for forgetting . 


Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , Midoriya midoriya backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . I admired -- 


Don t call me that , Todoroki todoroki objects . Please. I can t stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . 


Midoriya midoriya reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir didn t get along with the Firelord , but to be so open about it . 


Todoroki_Shouto todoroki must truly not care about family image . 


Okay�. Todoroki todoroki Todoroki_,_Midoriya midoriya stammers . But , um , yes , I admired All_Might all a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches . 


That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , Todoroki todoroki says without missing a beat . It s supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . 


Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya midoriya ? God , it s boiling . 


Haha , I m so dead . 


I. Well . Hm , Midoriya midoriya stammers , pulling at his midoriya collar and cringing under Todoroki todoroki s steady gaze . I guess ... I m just a quick learner ? 


Todoroki todoroki doesn t move and Midoriya midoriya s eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his midoriya skin being peeled back by the prince s gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his midoriya skin being flayed . It takes all of his midoriya willpower to avoid scampering off . 


... Sure , Todoroki says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He midoriya scans Midoriya midoriya one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd . 


Midoriya midoriya resists the urge to start hyperventilating . 


He midoriya gets the sense that he midoriya just had a very close call , even though there s no way in hell that Todoroki todoroki could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him midoriya . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover -- that , and Midoriya midoriya s horrendous ability to keep secrets . 


If he midoriya actually gets into Yuuei yuuei , he midoriya ll have to watch himself midoriya around the heir . 


He midoriya watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It s one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his midoriya mind and he midoriya finds himself midoriya both intimidated and inspired . 


This is what he midoriya could be if he midoriya gets into Yuuei yuuei . 


This is the power he midoriya could practice beside , the people he midoriya could befriend . 


-LRB- He midoriya tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his midoriya back . -RRB- 


When the final test is complete , the proctor calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there . 


Midoriya midoriya leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his midoriya stomach . 


x


When he midoriya finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it s simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true . 


He midoriya stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he midoriya needs to dress fast but taking his midoriya time regardless . How many times has he midoriya wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ? 


But he midoriya finds he midoriya can t get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high . 


The rules of the match echo through his midoriya head as he midoriya pulls off his midoriya own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants . 


This won t be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He midoriya looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya s future . 


Instead , it s one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . 


The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya midoriya yanks them on and wishes he midoriya had asked for a size up . He midoriya s grown more than he midoriya thought he midoriya had . 


The bare minimum to pass is KO ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . 


He midoriya shrugs the thick padding on over his midoriya shoulders , yanks the green sash around his midoriya waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his midoriya head . He midoriya exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall . 


You ll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . 


The lights of the arena are blinding ; he bakugou squints as he bakugou stumbles his bakugou way into the ring . He bakugou pays no mind to his bakugou teammates , solely focused on calming himself bakugou down before the match . 


If you fall out of the ring , you fail . 


He bakugou closes his bakugou eyes and inhales deeply . This is it . 


Some voice in the back of his bakugou head prompts him bakugou to wonder how Bakugou bakugou is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou he bakugou s thinking about , there s no reason to be worried . 


He bakugou needs to focus on himself bakugou . 


Hi again! 


Midoriya midoriya jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his midoriya thoughts , then flushes when he midoriya spots the speaker : pixie bob girl . 


Looks like we re on the same team , huh ? she notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya midoriya , then the other two team members behind him bakugou . The other two don t seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him bakugou and the firebender was a little zoned out . I don t think they re into the whole teamwork thing , y know ? 


Uh-huyeah , Midoriya midoriya says , internally slapping himself midoriya for the mix of gibberish he midoriya can t help but spew . 


Luckily , the girl doesn t seem to mind . Maybe she s used to it . Oh well , I guess we ll just have to watch each others backs . I m Uraraka uraraka , by the way ! 


Uraraka uraraka : bright , beautiful . How fitting. 


M-Midoriya m-midoriya , he m-midoriya replies . 


Nice to meet ya , Midoriya midoriya ! She drops her helmet on her head , gives him m-midoriya a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him m-midoriya to the middle line . 


Well , at least that s one advantage . Uraraka uraraka seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending isn t terribly offensive , she ll still cover for him m-midoriya . 


It s a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he m-midoriya joins his m-midoriya team at the start point . 


The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears . Not that it matters -- he already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his opponents and teammates . 


The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated . He s not sure if they re Yuuei students or hired benders , but they re older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination . 


His team is not quite so confident . Like Uraraka uraraka said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous . 


But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka s. Gone is her cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he sees is icy willpower . Her eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces . 


This girl means business . 


Rather than put him at ease , it disorients him further -- he s not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she steals points from him ? 


Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand . 


There s literally no logic in Uraraka uraraka trying to beat you ! You re on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you ll get enough points anyway , you ve done the work and -- 


-- riya ! 


He startles , whipping around to see Uraraka uraraka shouting at him . 


They re about to start ! 


He stumbles into Zone_1 1 and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya midoriya looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock . 


... 2 , 1 : GO . 


He doesn t even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach , sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 2 . He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet , scanning the scene ahead . 


The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it s already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she s already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka uraraka is cartwheeling across Zone_1 1 to avoid fire blasts . 


Midoriya midoriya raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he midoriya realizes . 


Wait. 


... Where s their waterbender ? 


The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He midoriya lands on his midoriya butt but then uses his midoriya ground contact to his midoriya advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his midoriya hands , which he midoriya then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it doesn t offer as much protection as he midoriya d like , but it s all that he midoriya s got . 


The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he midoriya peeks from around the side of his midoriya blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his midoriya Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet . 


Okay -- he midoriya has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him midoriya to score a point . But how? 


His midoriya eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his midoriya team s waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she ll be off the back . 


Time for a risk . 


Midoriya midoriya waits for a water-free moment , then flings his midoriya shield as hard as possible at the airbender . 


It doesn t connect , but it disorients her ; taking advantage of the distraction , his midoriya team s waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on . She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge . 


Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist . 


He midoriya gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him midoriya uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his midoriya teeth , he midoriya leans into the stream so he midoriya s on his midoriya hands and knees . 


As soon as the water lets up , he midoriya leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He midoriya ll have to make this fast . 


He midoriya keeps up the disk s momentum with his midoriya arms , flinging the rock and his midoriya energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his midoriya first point -- 


Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him midoriya and pushing him midoriya into Zone_2 2 . Midoriya midoriya s disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya midoriya drops his midoriya arms and cranes his midoriya head to look at the water s source . 


His midoriya teammate , wheeling his midoriya arms and prepping another water blast , doesn t even look at him midoriya as he midoriya shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork . 


-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya midoriya finds he midoriya can t be happy about it . -RRB- 


A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left . 


Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He midoriya still doesn t have any points ! Who�s even left to hit? 


Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she s nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two . 


Uraraka uraraka is now engaged with the earthbender -- she s struggling , but she s staying put in Zone_1 1 . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 2 , looking to pick a fight . 


Okay , there s Midoriya midoriya s target . 


The firebender , however , notices him midoriya first : she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him midoriya . He midoriya s forced to roll to the side . He midoriya pushes onto his midoriya feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming . 


He midoriya s only done defense so far -- but what else can he midoriya do ? How can he midoriya fight when the enemy won t even let him midoriya plant himself midoriya and utilize his midoriya bending ? 


Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka uraraka s fight , he midoriya has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he midoriya s going to get hit . 


Unless he midoriya gets a distraction . 


Uraraka uraraka ! Midoriya midoriya shouts , praying that she ll be able to spare a moment . Some air , please ! 


She jerks at her name , looking towards Midoriya midoriya and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent . Her gaze jumps over his fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes . She nods . 


Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she inhales deeply and holds . 


Midoriya midoriya shifts his midoriya core to head back in the direction he midoriya came from . 


Uraraka uraraka exhales and hell breaks loose . 


Something resembling a tornado erupts from her , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 3 to dodge it 3 . 


Now! Now Midoriya midoriya can go for the hit . He midoriya plants himself midoriya , raising a disk . 


But before he midoriya can even aim it 3 , the wind catches up to the firebender . She soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado . 


Midoriya midoriya stares , desperation clawing at his midoriya core . 


One hit ! he midoriya cries in frustration . I just need one hit ! 


He midoriya looks dully at the scene ahead -- there s just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka uraraka seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him midoriya again , if he midoriya s still here . 


Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it s just him midoriya and Uraraka uraraka . But she s more than capable -- if he midoriya tried to interfere , he midoriya d probably just mess her up . 


There s a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya midoriya whips around to see Uraraka uraraka pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team s earthbender stalking over . He midoriya gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his midoriya captive , the sharp motion making her wheeze . 


Midoriya midoriya s eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win . 


However , if Uraraka uraraka gets knocked out of the ring and it s just him uraraka and this_other_guy midoriya left Then they midoriya have to face off in a tiebreaker . 


Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya midoriya wins . 


But it also means that Uraraka uraraka fails . 


Midoriya midoriya thrusts his midoriya hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He midoriya repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he midoriya has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him midoriya . He midoriya grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he midoriya manages to stay upright . 


Meanwhile , the enemy is in position , arms pushing out from his body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka uraraka s rock coffin hurtling towards the edge -- 


With a guttural yell , Midoriya midoriya slams both his midoriya fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The_guy midoriya looks up in time for it midoriya to pummel into him midoriya , rocketing him midoriya away from Uraraka uraraka and towards the opposite edge . 


The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya midoriya s arms and he swears he can feel them fracture in at least five different places . 


His arms become pure , unadulterated pain . 


He collapses . 


Everything seems hazy as he watches his missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the enemy emerge dirty but unscathed . The man lifts his hands and Midoriya midoriya feels a disk slide under him and two disks rise to box him in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his arms . 


He can t move . 


His surroundings are shifting ; he s speeding towards the edge and he s accepted that there s nothing he can do , that his exam is over . 


He clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below -- 


But gravity never kicks in . 


He simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he realizes . 


He lolls his head to the side and spots Uraraka uraraka , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen . 


She adds her left arm to the movement , circling her hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya midoriya feels himself midoriya begin to drift back . 


When the ground is finally below him midoriya , Uraraka uraraka stops bending . Midoriya midoriya drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His midoriya eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes -- 


Aaaaaand your exam is over ! Yamada yells over the intercom . 


Midoriya midoriya blinks . 


All that training . All that work . And:


I got one hit . Just one hit , Midoriya midoriya moans , dropping his midoriya head to the ground . What kind of a bender am I 


There s something wet on his midoriya cheek and he midoriya closes his midoriya eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his midoriya arms . It seeps into his midoriya brain , clouding his midoriya thoughts , and he midoriya fights to stay awake . 


... him midoriya to the healers , now ! 


One hit . 


... what was that stunt 


One hit . 


... sure she s okay , get her a bag . 


One hit . 


The acrid smell of vomit reaches his midoriya nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his midoriya thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming . 


... he midoriya s repeating one hit , why . 


I failed . 


His midoriya brain flickers off . 


He midoriya doesn t eat much those next few days . 


His midoriya arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his midoriya mother the only evidence that anything happened . 


But the events of the exam plague his midoriya mind , looping over and over as he midoriya tries to settle back into normalcy , as he midoriya tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next . 


He midoriya s not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious . 


Sure , he midoriya stayed in the ring but no way that was enough to get him midoriya into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds . 


Bakugou bakugou got in Midoriya midoriya doesn t have to speculate on that . He bakugou s dreading seeing the smug look on his bakugou face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time . 


Maybe Uraraka uraraka got in . Maybe she ll remember that silly earthbending kid that couldn t even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam . 


He bakugou sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his bakugou fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he bakugou can learn from . 


But it feels wrong it feels like he bakugou should be following in All Might s steps and learning at Yuuei yuuei . 


How is he bakugou supposed to be great if he bakugou isn t learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he bakugou have made with the four nation s up and coming leaders like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he bakugou made those connections early ? 


Midoriya midoriya thinks of Todoroki s empty , calculating eyes and shudders . 


True , the prince didn t seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei yuuei would have been a good start . 


Midoriya midoriya is trapped in a cycle of misery thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His bakugou mother , the saint that she is , has allowed him bakugou to mope for the week , only prompting him bakugou to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she s let him bakugou be . She saw it coming and understands that he bakugou needs time to come to terms . 


He bakugou doesn t respond when his bakugou mom announces she s going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he bakugou hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he bakugou knows . 


I-Izuku ! His bakugou mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him bakugou a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . It s here ! 


Midoriya midoriya simply stares at the black lettering for a moment . 


Then he bakugou silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her hand and walking to his bakugou room . The door closes behind him bakugou with a resolute click and he bakugou takes a deep breath . 


Welp , this is it . 


Here is the confirmation that he bakugou needs a new plan . 


He bakugou sits at his bakugou desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his bakugou fears and he bakugou rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He bakugou hungrily begins to read . 


Midoriya_Izuku midoriya , it begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . 


Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score . 


The written exam is what he bakugou expected : he bakugou passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin . 


The power score is actually better than he bakugou expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score . 


But the combat column is where he bakugou trembles . The 1 draws his bakugou eyes in like a magnet , confirming his bakugou fears . 


He bakugou didn t score nearly high enough to get in . 


He bakugou s toast . 


Resigned , he bakugou lets his bakugou eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart . 


Welcome to Yuuei . 


His bakugou eyes skim over the words , then he bakugou double-takes . He bakugou backtracks and reads it again . 


It stays the same : Welcome to Yuuei . 


This has to be some sort of mistake . He bakugou has to call them , to tell them they sent him bakugou the wrong letter . 


He bakugou skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his bakugou eye . 


Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . 


Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She wanted to share points with me ? 


While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . 


... Teamwork and cooperation ? 


His gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping 59 under it sharply contrasts the 1 in the hits category . 


It s not a mistake . 


He 


He actually got into Yuuei . 


A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya midoriya finds that he doesn t care . It s not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in . 


Of course his first instinct is to tell All_Might all . 


The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his worldly contacts . But Midoriya midoriya wants to tell him in person regardless , to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed . 


He ll admit -- All Might doesn t seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he s a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya midoriya lacks in the waking world . 


-LRB- Maybe All_Might all is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB- 


When Midoriya midoriya clambers into bed that night , he knows what to do . With his headphones playing a soft song for him , he lays flat on his back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his eyes . 


He forces his heart to slow , makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed . 


The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown . 


When he opens his eyes again , he s not in his familiar forest . 


It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya midoriya can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he 's grown to know . 


The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his throat . 


Midoriya midoriya crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his midoriya fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his midoriya chest and he midoriya can t say why , but something in the dust feels alive ? Tormented ? 


Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ? 


He midoriya begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he midoriya does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he midoriya has to help , he midoriya ca n't just leave them -- 


His midoriya hand brushes something solid and he midoriya halts for a moment . Then he midoriya starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his midoriya horror , he midoriya realizes that it 's a hand . 


He midoriya falls backwards on his midoriya butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison . 


Several things happen at once . 


The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya midoriya in sheets , invading his midoriya clothes , his midoriya eyes , his midoriya throat . He midoriya chokes -- more accurately , he midoriya drowns . 


The hand closes the gap , crawling over his midoriya foot and clamping onto his midoriya ankle . He midoriya wastes air and yelps , flailing his midoriya leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his midoriya energy wanes ; he midoriya sinks , head hitting the ground . He midoriya can only watch the thing with his midoriya eyes , unable to escape . 


It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya midoriya s blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body . 


The mass climbs its way up his midoriya unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him midoriya even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya midoriya s . He midoriya tries to jerk his midoriya face away but finds that he midoriya ca n't . 


I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold . 


Midoriya midoriya s eyes widen ; he midoriya reaches at his midoriya last scraps of energy and renews his midoriya efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his midoriya throat . He midoriya lets out a weak wheeze of agony . 


The thing leans in , almost brushing_Midoriya midoriya s nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya midoriya s spine . 


It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya midoriya imagines it would be smiling . 


You think you re safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice . 


Midoriya midoriya s head lulls , his midoriya eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his midoriya body . 


How naive. 


His midoriya eyes are closed and he midoriya s barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear . 


You obviously have no idea what 's coming . 


Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya midoriya s armpits , yanking him midoriya under the mound of dust and into the earth . He midoriya swallows dust and sees no more . 


x


A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya midoriya s throat as he midoriya bolts upright . 


Escape . 


He midoriya has to escape . 


There 's something confining his midoriya legs -- 


He midoriya kicks his midoriya way out from under his midoriya sheets , stumbling from his midoriya bed and tripping onto the floor . 


The soft carpeting of his midoriya room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him midoriya from the walls . 


He midoriya 's in the real world . 


He midoriya 's safe . 


Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his midoriya mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her face . 


Izuku izuku ! What happened? 


Midoriya midoriya ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his midoriya chest , then another . 


He midoriya 's cried in front of his midoriya mom before . This isn t new . 


But it feels different -- it s embarrassing . He midoriya s supposed to hold up the whole world but he midoriya can t even hold himself midoriya together . 


He midoriya drops his midoriya face in his midoriya hands . 


His midoriya mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her arms around him midoriya in a comforting embrace . 


There there , Izuku izuku , she murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his midoriya back . It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . 


But it wo n't . And he midoriya wo n't . 


How is he midoriya supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ? 


How is he midoriya supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ? 


What is that thing ? What is it plotting ? 


How is he midoriya supposed to stop it ? 


In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his midoriya back and he midoriya collapses under it , clinging to his midoriya mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that : 


A boy .
