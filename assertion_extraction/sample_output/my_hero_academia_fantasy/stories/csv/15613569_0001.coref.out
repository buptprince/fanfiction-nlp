15613569,1,3,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) walked through the woods with a scowl on his ($_bakugou) face . The sun beaming down on his ($_bakugou) golden hair , the sweat on his ($_bakugou) forehead reflecting like brilliant diamonds . It was late in the afternoon and he ($_bakugou) knew he ($_bakugou) wasn t supposed to be out in the woods , he ($_bakugou) was supposed to be eating with his ($_bakugou) family . But he ($_bakugou) couldn t be fucked to deal with his ($_bakugou) parents . It was their third fight that week . The woods seemed to be his ($_bakugou) sanctuary , the only place where he ($_bakugou) could truly be at peace . The only place where he ($_bakugou) could be alone . 
"
15613569,1,4,"The Bakuhatsu tribe ruled the forest , they were feared hunters and aggressive warriors . Known for their brave spirit and incredible fighting abilities . They were one of the first users of sorcery , but sorcery was banned from the tribe ever since the great battle . The woods were their domain , any other kingdom who dared enter the woods were trespassing on their territory . 
"
15613569,1,5,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) wouldn t call himself ($_bakugou) a prince . He ($_bakugou) was far from royalty and he ($_bakugou) barely behaved like a royal anyways . He ($_bakugou) was more of a successor . His ($_bakugou) parents were the leaders of the tribe , and he ($_bakugou) was destined to take over once they passed on . But he ($_bakugou) didn t feel like he ($_bakugou) was worthy enough . He ($_bakugou) never felt like he ($_bakugou) was worthy enough . He ($_bakugou) was always training , always trying to make himself ($_bakugou) better so he ($_bakugou) could take over once his ($_bakugou) parents died . But he ($_bakugou) knew for now , he ($_bakugou) was not ready . 
"
15613569,1,6,"He ($_bakugou) leapt from tree to tree angry muttering to himself ($_bakugou) , throwing about curse words as he ($_bakugou) spoke of his ($_bakugou) parents . He ($_bakugou) jumped from vine to vine and leapt from trunk to trunk , before he ($_bakugou) came to a clearing at the bottom of the dreaded Mount Yabura . This clearing was his ($_bakugou) sanctuary , he ($_bakugou) would come after all his ($_bakugou) fights to train his ($_bakugou) sorcery , to improve his ($_bakugou) fighting , or even to meditate . He ($_bakugou) would go there to be alone . 
"
15613569,1,7,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) knew sorcery was illegal in his ($_bakugou) tribe , but there was something so intriguing about it , he ($_bakugou) had found an old book on it and had been practicing it ever since , he ($_bakugou) knew it would be useful in combat . But if his ($_bakugou) parents knew about it they would kill him ($_bakugou) .

15613569,1,9,"He ($_bakugou) sparred with several training dummies he ($_bakugou) had set up , stabbing them with his ($_bakugou) sword and punching them in the stomachs and twisting their necks , doing anything to take out his ($_bakugou) rage . He ($_bakugou) chanted spell words to himself ($_bakugou) and watched with a grin on his ($_bakugou) face as large explosions burst from his ($_bakugou) palms and took out the training dummies . He ($_bakugou) was handling sorcery better and better , but he ($_bakugou) knew he ($_bakugou) could still improve . He ($_bakugou) never truly felt perfect .

"
15613569,1,15,"The footsteps grew louder . Bakugou ($_bakugou) quickly ran over to a large tree and ducked behind it . He ($_bakugou) quickly looked around the corner before his ($_bakugou) heart froze .

"
15613569,1,18,"The_boy ($_bakugou) spun around just as bakugou ($_bakugou) ducked behind the tree . Bakugou ($_bakugou) stood there completely silent , not even taking a breath , before turning around to see the_boy ($_bakugou) was gone . 
"
