11951565,3,1,"Both Iida and Mina were snoring when Ochako ($_ochako) slipped out of the room . She ($_ochako) slowly opened the door , wincing when it creaked slightly , and she ($_ochako) swung it quicker , scooting out as she ($_ochako) pulled it closed behind her ($_ochako) . The faster the better she ($_ochako) supposed , as she ($_ochako) let the machine on the handle click shut with a small whir . She ($_ochako) stood frozen outside of the door , waiting to see if either of them woke up . She ($_ochako) knew Iida ($_iida) would be completely against her ($_ochako) going out alone , but she ($_ochako) had to know if it was him ($_iida) . 
"
11951565,3,2,"Bakugou Katsuki . Leader of the Explodo-Pirates ... Could he ($_iida) really be the boy who had saved her ($_ochako) all those years ago ? He ($_iida) had been such a jerk earlier in the night-then again , he ($_iida) had n't been the nicest when they were children , at least not with his ($_iida) words . She ($_ochako) had n't recognized him ($_iida) at all , so she ($_ochako) did n't expect him ($_iida) to remember her ($_ochako) , and Ochako ($_ochako) looked incredibly different . Her ($_ochako) hair was much shorter , and she ($_ochako) felt she ($_ochako) did n't look as girly , especially in the way she ($_ochako) dressed . She ($_ochako) had to find him ($_iida) and ask ... she ($_ochako) was too impatient to wait for the morning . And what if he ($_iida) did n't show up ? If he ($_iida) disappeared off the island , she ($_ochako) might never have another chance . 
"
11951565,3,3,"Hopping down the stairs , she ($_ochako) leaned against the concierge 's counter . She ($_ochako) rolled the tips of her ($_ochako) fingers over the desk and leaned on her ($_ochako) hand . `` I ($_ochako) have a question , '' she ($_ochako) hummed happily . 
"
11951565,3,4,"""Yeah?"" the_man ($_iida) said tiredly . He ($_iida) looked incredibly bored , his ($_iida) dark top hat covering the majority of his ($_iida) brow . 
"
11951565,3,5,"`` Could you tell me if Bakugou Katsuki , leader of the , uh , Explodo-Pirates has a room here ? '' 
"
11951565,3,6,"The_large_man ($_iida) leaned forward , raising his ($_iida) eyebrow at the girl . `` You know , I ($_iida) 'm not really supposed to tell people about other guests , '' he ($_iida) said . 
"
11951565,3,7,"Ochako ($_ochako) sighed , of course that was the case . In this day and age , privacy was so rare , she ($_ochako) had almost expected to find the information easily . It was n't going to stop her ($_ochako) from pushing . Gripping the counter , she ($_ochako) pulled herself ($_ochako) up on her ($_ochako) tiptoes , leaning over . `` Please , '' she ($_ochako) asked . `` It 's really important that I see him , '' she ($_ochako) urged . `` In fact , I ($_ochako) wo n't leave until you tell me ($_ochako) . '' She ($_ochako) cursed herself ($_ochako) for not bringing her ($_ochako) wallet with her ($_ochako) , a little bribery never hurt anyone . 
"
11951565,3,8,"The_man ($_iida) rolled his ($_iida) eyes , realizing how serious she ($_ochako) was from the way her ($_ochako) brow frowned , staring at him ($_iida) . `` Look , he ($_iida) 's not staying here . I ($_iida) can tell you ($_iida) that guy has his own place in town . The tall apartment building next to Bounty 's Haven . '' 
"
11951565,3,9,"Of course he ($_iida) lived right next to the bar . Smiling , Ochako ($_ochako) lowered herself ($_ochako) to the floor . `` Thank you ($_iida) , '' she ($_ochako) said , and turned on her ($_ochako) heel as she ($_ochako) made her ($_ochako) way out of the hotel . The bar was n't very far , as she ($_ochako) knew from walking to the hotel after they had eaten earlier in the evening , but the walk felt as though it took forever . A few sketchy looking characters called out to her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) ignored them , focusing on her ($_ochako) one goal . She ($_ochako) had to speak to Bakugou again . The closer she ($_ochako) got to the bar , the more her ($_ochako) heart pounded , thinking of what exactly she ($_ochako) would say to him . What could she ($_ochako) say ? She ($_ochako) wanted to thank him again ... 
"
11951565,3,10,"And maybe she ($_ochako) wanted to convince him to go with her ($_ochako) . He 'd helped her ($_ochako) once before , and she ($_ochako) was n't sure why this would be any different of a situation . They were older now , they could fight to get their home back . She ($_ochako) remembered how fiery his red eyes had once been , how he 'd sacrificed himself so she ($_ochako) could get away . Maybe she ($_ochako) just wanted to tell him she ($_ochako) was happy he was alive . 
"
11951565,3,11,"She ($_ochako) stood in front of the tall building , craning her ($_ochako) neck up . It was about 12 stories tall , and one of the larger buildings on the island . Of course it was an apartment building , which meant she ($_ochako) 'd have to figured out which was his . Making her ($_ochako) way to the directory , she ($_ochako) pushed the button , pulling up a bright blue screen . Sliding her ($_ochako) finger down she ($_ochako) searched for his name . `` Aha ! '' she ($_ochako) said as her ($_ochako) eyes fell upon the familiar characters . Bakugou Katsuki , apartment 1208 . Of course he was on the top floor . 
"
11951565,3,12,"Groaning , she ($_ochako) pulled a small pouch from off of the belt tied above her ($_ochako) skirt . Holding the end of the cloth she ($_ochako) dumped the mechanical ball into her ($_ochako) hand . It was small , tiny enough to fit in the palm of her ($_ochako) hand and had patterns of lines and dots covering its copper surface . She ($_ochako) held it up to her ($_ochako) ear , shaking it . `` Hmm ... '' she ($_ochako) muttered . `` Almost out of juice . '' She ($_ochako) looked up to the sky , trying to count how many apartments across 8 would be , though she ($_ochako) was n't sure which side they started on , or if it was evens on this side or odds . 
"
11951565,3,13,"`` It should last me long enough ... '' she ($_ochako) hummed , pushing two of the larger buttons on the ball and twisting the sides to the left , up , left , down , up again and then right . A warm pink glow enveloped her ($_ochako) body , and she ($_ochako) tilted her ($_ochako) head back . Her ($_ochako) skin began to crawl , her ($_ochako) hair slowly rising as she ($_ochako) began to float upwards . The anti-gravity ball would n't last long , so she ($_ochako) knew she ($_ochako) would n't be able to maintain floating next to the building for a long time . 
"
11951565,3,14,"She ($_ochako) pushed off of the ground , shooting up close to the building . The closer she ($_ochako) drew to the top floor , she ($_ochako) realized a loud snoring came from an open window . `` Who keeps their window wide open at night ? '' This island was small , but it was still a heavily populated area . 
"
11951565,3,15,"Peering inside , she ($_ochako) saw a red haired boy laying on the bed , legs awkwardly spread , mouth wide as he snored , drool slipping down his chin . She ($_ochako) wrinkled her ($_ochako) nose , wondering how boys could sleep like that . He snorted , and she ($_ochako) jerked back , sighing with relief when he did n't wake up . Leaning back in , she ($_ochako) realized he looked familiar , maybe one of the boys who was with Bakugou ($_bakugou) at the bar ? Glancing to the side , she ($_ochako) realized the window next to his was also open , and she ($_ochako) pushed herself ($_ochako) that way . Floating outside the window , she ($_ochako) felt her ($_ochako) heart rate quicken when she ($_ochako) saw him . 
"
11951565,3,16,"With how loud he normally was , it was strange to see him in such a relaxed position . His eyes were shut , his mouth barely open . His face looked peaceful , far less angry than it had before . He looked ... handsome , actually , and she ($_ochako) felt a blush rise to her ($_ochako) cheeks . She ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) head , realizing she ($_ochako) was somewhat of a creeper , staring at him through the window while he slept . 
"
11951565,3,17,"There was a crackling noise , and she ($_ochako) glanced down as the mechanical ball in her ($_ochako) hand blinked bright red , signaling her ($_ochako) time was almost up . Her ($_ochako) eyes widened as she ($_ochako) felt her ($_ochako) body growing heavier . 
"
11951565,3,18,"With a scream , she ($_ochako) lurched forward , grabbing onto the curtain rod as she ($_ochako) swung into his room , slamming to the ground and tangling herself ($_ochako) in the curtain she ($_ochako) had brought with her ($_ochako) when she ($_ochako) fell . 
"
11951565,3,19,"Gasping for her ($_ochako) breath , she ($_ochako) desperately tried to free herself ($_ochako) as she ($_ochako) rolled around on the ground . Behind her ($_ochako) , she ($_ochako) heard him groan , and move in the bed . # . "" ... the ... hell ? '' he growled , sitting up in bed as she ($_ochako) escaped from her ($_ochako) curtain entanglement . 
"
11951565,3,20,"Squeaking , she ($_ochako) froze , unable to say anything to argue her ($_ochako) case . She ($_ochako) had technically just broke in , even if his window had been open . 
"
11951565,3,21,"And like a flash , he moved towards her ($_ochako) , tackling her ($_ochako) towards the ground as he pulled a knife from his belt , holding it to her ($_ochako) throat . She ($_ochako) winced as her ($_ochako) head hit the floor hard , and she ($_ochako) let out a whimper , tears pooling in the corner of her ($_ochako) eyes . 
"
11951565,3,22,"`` Who the HELL are you and what the FUCK are you doing here ?! '' he screamed , spittle flying into her ($_ochako) face . 
"
11951565,3,23,"She ($_ochako) took a breath , feeling the sharp edge of the knife against her ($_ochako) throat as she ($_ochako) swallowed . `` My ($_ochako) name is ... Uraraka Ochako , your former princess , Bakugou Katsuki . '' 
"
11951565,3,24,"~~
"
11951565,3,25,"All he could hear was the sound of his angered breathing . He could hear the huffed breaths puffing out of his mouth , so when she ($_ochako) said Uraraka_Ochako ($_uraraka) , he was certain he had misheard . This intruder looked nothing like the princess , though she ($_ochako) did have a round , gentle face . Her ($_ochako) hair was far too short , but her ($_ochako) brown eyes did look a little familiar . 
"
11951565,3,26,"He had no idea where the princess had gone , but he doubted she ($_ochako) was some dumb ass thief . So this chick was a damn liar-which only made Bakugou ($_bakugou) even angrier . He pressed the tip of the knife against her ($_ochako) shoulder . `` Liar ! '' 
"
11951565,3,27,"She ($_ochako) winced , slamming her ($_ochako) eyes shut . `` I ($_ochako) 'm not ! I ($_ochako) swear ! '' she ($_ochako) pleaded , her ($_ochako) brown eyes staring up at him with determination . `` If you ($_ochako) give me a chance , '' she ($_ochako) snapped , her ($_ochako) eyes flicking towards the knife , `` I can show you ($_ochako) ! '' 
"
11951565,3,28,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) was n't one to give people chances , not in this day and age . Anyone could be with The_Academy ($_the) and it ($_the) was n't worth taking any risks . So why he chose to slowly pull the knife back was a mystery to him . Perhaps it was because he had no idea how this person would know he was originally from that particular island . Then again , The_Academy ($_the) had no problem gathering information they ($_the) wanted at any given time . 
"
11951565,3,29,"She ($_ochako) let out a sigh , and kept her ($_ochako) brown eyes locked on his reds . `` I ($_ochako) 'm going to show you ($_ochako) ... '' she ($_ochako) said quietly . ""So don't freak out!"" She ($_ochako) reached her ($_ochako) hand down to a pouch around her ($_ochako) waist , and pulled it up . Bakugou ($_bakugou) knew she ($_ochako) could be pulling out a weapon , but the look on her ($_ochako) face said otherwise . He ($_bakugou) had to admit , he ($_bakugou) was a little surprised when she ($_ochako) pulled out a tiny ring with a moon pendant on the band . He ($_bakugou) eyes widened , and she ($_ochako) reached forwards quickly , grabbing at the necklace dangling around his ($_bakugou) neck . 
"
11951565,3,30,"""See!"" she ($_ochako) said , holding the end of the pendant up . Both of the moons were a soft pink and fit perfectly together , wrapping around each other . The necklace dangled in front of his ($_bakugou) face , and Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) nose wrinkled slightly as he ($_bakugou) stared at the spinning , now conjoined jewelry . `` I ($_bakugou) am Uraraka_Ochako ($_uraraka) ! '' she ($_ochako) stated . `` I ($_ochako) gave this to you after you saved me ($_ochako) . Your mother ... she ($_ochako) gave me ($_ochako) a hat , and I ($_ochako) pulled it over my ($_ochako) hair and got on an airship . You sacrificed yourself to rescue me ($_ochako) ... you let the men catch you and I ($_ochako) thought ... I ($_ochako) thought for sure you were dead . But then tonight , when we came to hire you ... I ($_ochako) knew it was you ! '' Her ($_ochako) words were hurried , and came out babbled . 
"
11951565,3,31,"His ($_bakugou) red eyes darted between her ($_ochako) face and the moon pendant . She ($_ochako) would be about this old he ($_bakugou) assumed ... and she ($_ochako) had known a fucking large amount of detail about an event he ($_bakugou) had shared with no one . 
"
11951565,3,32,"Fucking Hell . 
"
11951565,3,33,"`` HAH ?! '' he ($_bakugou) yelled . He ($_bakugou) pulled his ($_bakugou) necklace back , unhooking the pendants as he ($_bakugou) tucked the knife into his ($_bakugou) belt . He ($_bakugou) stood up , running his ($_bakugou) hands through his ($_bakugou) hair . `` You 're the fucking ... princess ?! You 're fucking alive ?! '' he ($_bakugou) growled , yelling as he ($_bakugou) stomped about the room , his ($_bakugou) feet vibrating the floor as he ($_bakugou) walked . 
"
11951565,3,34,"`` That 's my line ! '' she said , pushing herself up . She brushed off the ends of her brown skirt , and adjusted the goggles which sat upon her head . He ($_bakugou) could n't stop staring at her . She was , in fact , the princess he ($_bakugou) had rescued so many years ago . Sure , she was n't in a fancy dress or masquerade mask . Her long brown hair had been replaced for a short bob , but her round face was still bright , her brown eyes full of far too much hope for someone whose whole life had been stolen from her . Once again , he ($_bakugou) could n't take his ($_bakugou) eyes off her . 
"
11951565,3,35,"`` I had no idea you were alive ! I figured those men would 've killed you for sure ! '' she exclaimed . 
"
11951565,3,36,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) snorted , kicking at the floor . ""Yeah, right. Like I 'd let a couple of goons like that kill me ! '' he ($_bakugou) snarled , laughing loudly . 
"
11951565,3,37,"She sighed , lowering her gaze to the floor . Her brown bangs covered her eyes , which covered her face almost completely . `` Idiot ... '' she whispered , her body trembling . 
"
11951565,3,38,"`` I 'm no idiot ! I 'm amazing , the best fucking bounty hunter out there ! '' he ($_bakugou) growled , defensive . 
"
11951565,3,39,"`` IDIOT ! '' she yelled , turning her round brown eyes towards his ($_bakugou) face , tears pooling in their corners . 
"
11951565,3,40,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) froze , staring at the crying former princess . What the hell was he ($_bakugou) supposed to do with a crying girl !? His ($_bakugou) cheeks heated up far more than he ($_bakugou) wanted them to . He ($_bakugou) could n't watch her cry for him ($_bakugou) . Her round face was actually ... cute , and seeing her look so distraught was something he ($_bakugou) did n't quite know how to handle . `` W-Why the hell are you crying ?! '' he ($_bakugou) said finally . 
"
11951565,3,41,"""Because!"" she gasped , wiping her eyes quickly . `` You 're alive ! I just ... I ca n't believe you 're alive . You saved my life and I never ... I never thought I 'd find you again ! '' 
"
11951565,3,42,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt his ($_bakugou) eye twitch , was it really such a damn big deal she found him ($_bakugou) ? He ($_bakugou) supposed he ($_bakugou) was a little relieved to see her still alive . After he ($_bakugou) had left so much behind for her , and she was technically the reason he ($_bakugou) was the best bounty hunter around . Though one question nagged at his ($_bakugou) mind ... how exactly did she find him ($_bakugou) ?! 
"
11951565,3,43,"`` Yeah , ` bout that , '' he ($_bakugou) grunted . `` What the HELL are you doing sneaking into my apartment ?! Where the fuck did you come from ?! '' he ($_bakugou) asked . 
"
11951565,3,44,"`` Eh ? '' she said , her wide eyes blinking . ""Oh! I guess I assumed you remembered me from earlier , '' she giggled , rubbing the back of her neck . 
"
11951565,3,45,"`` You sneak into my apartment and expect me to just remember you !? '' he ($_bakugou) growled . 
"
11951565,3,46,"She waved her hands in front of herself quickly . `` No ... but ... I wanted to confirm it was you ! Y ` see earlier I was with the group asking you to join the_Resistance ($_the) , but when I got back to the hotel it ($_the) hit me ! '' she said , slapping her fist against her palm . `` You 're Bakugou Katsuki ! So I. . . asked around and found where you lived and viola ! '' Suddenly , her eyes went wide , and she ran her hands along her belt , patting at a few of the small pouches . `` Oh no , oh no ! Where is it ?! '' she gasped . 
"
11951565,3,47,"It had been hard enough for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to fully pay attention when she was rambling at him ($_iida) , but now she was scurrying about the room , looking on the floor . 
"
11951565,3,48,"`` OI ! Princess - '' 
"
11951565,3,49,"""Shoot!"" she groaned . `` Iida ($_iida) will kill me if I lost it ! '' She jumped to the floor , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) had to quickly avert his ($_bakugou) eyes , not wanting to stare at her behind as she dug around under his ($_bakugou) bed . 
"
11951565,3,50,"`` What the hell are you - '' he ($_bakugou) began to yell , annoyed she was all around his ($_bakugou) personal items . 
"
11951565,3,51,"`` FOUND IT ! '' she called out and jumped back up . 
"
11951565,3,52,"`` What are you talking about ?! '' he ($_bakugou) yelled , annoyed she was n't focusing on him ($_bakugou) . 
"
11951565,3,53,"`` My Gravity Ball ! '' she said , holding the small copper ball out towards him ($_bakugou) . `` When charged , it lets you float freely , '' she smiled . `` That 's how I got up here , and someone was sleeping with his window open . But ... the charge ran out , which is why I sort of ... tumbled in here , '' she giggled . 
"
11951565,3,54,"He ($_bakugou) stared at her for a moment , his ($_bakugou) brow twitching again . Folding his ($_bakugou) arms with a huff , he ($_bakugou) leaned back against the windowsill . `` So you 're the chick who was begging for us to join up ? '' he ($_bakugou) said gruffly . 
"
11951565,3,55,"`` Yeah ... '' she sighed . `` I was going to wait to see if you would show up tomorrow to meet with us ... but I was nervous you were n't going to , '' she admitted , rubbing the side of her arm . 
"
11951565,3,56,"Truthfully , he ($_bakugou) had had no intention of meeting up with the_Resistance ($_the) . He ($_bakugou) had been serious when he ($_bakugou) mentioned wanting nothing to do with The Academy . He ($_bakugou) wanted to stick with his ($_bakugou) crew , make money , live his ($_bakugou) life as the best bounty hunter ; King of the Explodo-Pirates . 
"
11951565,3,57,"He ($_bakugou) blew a large breath of air up , his ($_bakugou) unruly blond bangs flopping against his ($_bakugou) forehead . `` Why the hell are you even with the_Resistance_anyway ($_the) ?! '' he ($_bakugou) said . As far as Bakugou ($_bakugou) was concerned , the_Resistance ($_the) was fucking useless . He ($_bakugou) had no desire to be around a group who got absolutely nothing done . `` Ca n't ya ' just give that up and come with us or some shit ? '' he ($_bakugou) suggested . 
"
11951565,3,58,"She frowned . `` Of course not ! '' she said . `` The_Academy ($_the) took everything from me ... took everything from us ! Me , you , all of us ! '' she exclaimed .

And you know what , '' he ($_bakugou) growled , leaning in closer to her face . `` I 'm pretty damn close to having a team like that . Hell I probably could take them out myself if there were n't so damn many of those fucked up cyborgs ! '' he ($_bakugou) snapped . Her eyes wide as their noses almost touched , and he ($_bakugou) even noticed a hint of a blush scattered over her cheeks . 
"
11951565,3,60,"Up close , she smelled sweet , like lilacs on a summer morning . It was a smell he ($_bakugou) had n't experienced in quite a long while , and memories of his ($_bakugou) mother came rushing back . He ($_bakugou) could see the tiny room he ($_bakugou) grew up in , the way she scolded him ($_bakugou) when he ($_bakugou) was too loud or rowdy with Deku . The castle ... it brought back painful memories , memories he ($_bakugou) chose not to think about . 
"
11951565,3,61,"She took a step back and sighed . `` Katsuki ... '' she whispered , `` do n't you want ... to get our home back ?! '' she exclaimed .

11951565,3,62,"As a child , there had been a time he ($_bakugou) would 've jumped at the chance to run into battle against The Academy-destroy every single one of those cyborg scum . He ($_bakugou) 'd charged against a few soldiers after she had gotten away , and he ($_bakugou) 'd been thrown to the ground , kicked and bruised . His ($_bakugou) pride had hurt most the day he ($_bakugou) 'd helped her , and when he ($_bakugou) ended up on Bounty Island , he ($_bakugou) 'd sworn to be the best damn bounty hunter there was . And someday if he ($_bakugou) was strong enough , he ($_bakugou) 'd cut The_Academy ($_the) so far down they 'd never get back up again .

11951565,3,87,"`` It 'll be fine , '' she repeated , waving her hand up and down . 
"
11951565,3,88,"The three of them took their leave , walking from the hotel down towards the main floating docks . Bakugou ($_bakugou) had given her a number , noting where their airship would be , and what time to be there . Yes , they were a little late -LRB- mostly due to Iida_'s ($_iida) griping -RRB- , but Ochako_'s ($_ochako) assumptions had been right . They had n't left without them . 
"
11951565,3,89,"`` You 're late ! '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled , his ($_bakugou) feet stomping against the metal entryway . `` We 're just about ready to leave and I was going to leave your asses ! '' He ($_bakugou) turned around , wanting them to follow .

11951565,3,93,"Stepping up inside , the three followed Bakugou ($_bakugou) , waiting for him ($_iida) to close the hatch . Carrying her ($_bakugou) suitcase , Ochako ($_ochako) followed eagerly behind . It had been awhile since she ($_bakugou) 'd been on such a large airship , and her ($_bakugou) brown eyes were wide , taking in all the interesting trinkets . Valves and lamps lined the hallways , steam shooting out from pipes here and there . Iida ($_iida) looked nervous the deeper into the ship they went , but Mina ($_mina) shared Ochako_'s ($_ochako) excitement for the new , and larger ship . The three of them were admittedly thankful to be in a much larger space than the tiny ship they had used before . 
"
11951565,3,94,"`` Come on , '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) barked , opening the door as they stepped out onto the large bridge .

11951565,3,97,"A group of people began to accumulate on the bridge , standing in a group by Bakugou ($_bakugou) .

The other girl had short , deep purple hair , which framed her cheek bones . The other boys looked to be a wild bunch , a blond with spiky hair , a serious looking male with dark features , and a strange boy with half his hair colored white and the other colored red .

11951565,3,196,"`` I 'm aware , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . 
"
11951565,3,197,"Turning a few of the dials , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) pulled up the main screen , the large blue rectangle flashing as the page began to load . The underground information circuit was n't difficult to find if you knew where to look . It required specific browsers , proxys and passwords to bypass the_Academy ($_the) . The circuit was mostly used by hunters , pirates , thugs , and occasionally the Resistance it seemed . It was meant to be for illegal dealers who wished to go unnoticed by the_Academy ($_the) . 
"
11951565,3,198,"`` Hmm ... '' Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) hummed , words flashing on the screen as he ($_tokoyami) typed furiously . `` I 'm not ... seeing anything about her . There are records the_Academy ($_the) has ... news snippets not located on the deep circuit , '' he explained . `` But they ($_the) say her entire family was killed ... '' 
"
11951565,3,199,"`` Maybe that 's what the_Academy ($_the) wants you to believe , '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) said softly . 
"
11951565,3,200,"`` Or she 's lying , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) commented quickly . 
"
11951565,3,201,"Suddenly , Yaoyorozu 's eyes widened . `` Wait , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) ! Try searching for Ocha and the Resistance . '' 
"
11951565,3,202,"`` Ocha ? '' Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) repeated . 
"
11951565,3,203,"""Yes!"" 
"
11951565,3,204,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) was eyeing her curiously , but she smirked , knowing her idea was going to work . 
"
11951565,3,205,"`` Oi ! Everyone should be done preparing to leave . Meet on the bridge in 5 minutes ! '' Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) voice boomed over the speaker . 
"
11951565,3,206,"`` Hurry ! '' she hissed , glancing behind her shoulder . The last thing they needed was to get caught by Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
"
11951565,3,207,"`` Aha ! '' Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) said , pulling up a file onto the main screen . It was a picture of Ochako_'s ($_ochako) face , though all that was listed was her ($_ochako) first name shortened to Ocha . It did , however , mention her ($_ochako) as part of the Resistance . Saying where she ($_ochako) was stationed and how she ($_ochako) fell under Iida Tenya 's squad , it certainly checked out . 
"
11951565,3,208,"`` I knew it , '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) said , looking proud of herself ($_yaoyorozu) . 
"
11951565,3,209,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) smiled , his eyes shimmering while he stared at her ($_ochako) . 
"
11951565,3,210,"`` How did you know ? '' Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) asked . 
"
11951565,3,211,"`` I heard Mina ($_mina) call her ($_mina) her_Ocha ($_her) , I thought it ($_her) might be a code name , '' she ($_mina) smiled . 
"
11951565,3,212,"""What's...going on here?"" a soft voice called from behind them , and the three froze . Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) did n't need to turn around to know that voice belonged to Uraraka Ochako . 
"
11951565,3,213,"~~
"
11951565,3,214,"When she ($_mina) stepped into her ($_mina) room , Ochako ($_ochako) dropped her ($_mina) suitcase onto the bed and stood on her ($_mina) tiptoes to look out of the small circular window . The clouds stretched as far as the eye could see . They really were on the outskirts of Academy territory ; no other islands nearby . She ($_mina) wondered how far this ship had gone out there , where it had traveled and what it had seen . Silently , she ($_mina) began to grow more excited for their own adventure . She ($_mina) was on a real airship again ! 
"
11951565,3,215,"Twirling around , she ($_mina) felt her ($_mina) skirt swish around her ($_mina) legs . She ($_mina) knew she ($_mina) should 've been more nervous , preparing to take on the_Academy ($_the) . That was what being a part of the Resistance was all about ! And yet , she ($_mina) felt her ($_mina) heart pound with the thrill of adventure . 
"
11951565,3,216,"Plus , there was a small part of her ($_mina) that could n't believe Katsuki ($_katsuki) was still alive . She ($_mina) played with the small ring she ($_mina) held in her ($_mina) pocket , the tips of her ($_mina) fingers gliding over the edge of crescent moon . 
"
11951565,3,217,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) He 'd saved her ($_mina) once , and now he was going to help her ($_mina) again . It seemed she ($_mina) kept forcing him into these situations . Though , he was older now , and quite unruly from what she ($_mina) had witnessed thus far . If he really had n't wanted to help , he probably would n't have . 
"
11951565,3,218,"She ($_mina) blushed , thinking about it again , thinking about him again . She ($_mina) remembered how intense his red eyes had looked when they hovered above her ($_mina) , the tip of the knife grazing her ($_mina) chest . They really were older ... and he was handsome ... even if he did seem to constantly scowl . 
"
11951565,3,219,"She ($_mina) covered her ($_mina) cheeks . `` No Ochako ! Stop , '' she ($_mina) said and quickly shook her ($_mina) head back and forth . This was no time to be thinking about romance , or anything of the sort . Still , it did seem like something out of a fairy tale-finding a boy who had rescued her ($_mina) when she ($_mina) was just a child . And it was n't like he had forgotten about her ($_mina) ! He still wore the crescent moon ring she ($_mina) had given him around his neck . 
"
11951565,3,220,"Groaning she ($_mina) flopped back onto the bed . She ($_mina) had a job to do , Iida ($_iida) was right . She ($_mina) was one of the last remaining princesses in the entire sector . She ($_mina) wanted to destroy the_Academy ($_the) ... destroy the androids who had killed her ($_mina) parents and Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) mother the androids who had forced them to flee from their home . It was important to her ($_mina) , and having Katsuki ($_katsuki) and his ($_katsuki) crew 's help was finally a positive step towards achieving this goal . 
"
11951565,3,221,"As Iida ($_iida) had pointed out , having hunters on their side would add to their fire power , and the more people on their side , the more chances they would have . Still , thoughts of his ($_katsuki) red , powerful eyes kept running through her ($_mina) mind . 
"
11951565,3,222,"`` Oi ! Everyone should be about done preparing to leave . Meet on the bridge in 5 minutes ! '' Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) voice penetrated her ($_bakugou) ears , and sent a quick shiver down her ($_bakugou) spine , even with the way it was muffled completely by the speaker . 
"
11951565,3,223,"She ($_bakugou) sighed , kicking her ($_bakugou) feet up as she ($_bakugou) pulled herself ($_bakugou) off of the bed . She ($_bakugou) had to focus ! `` Focus , Ocha , focus ! '' she ($_bakugou) said , slapping her ($_bakugou) cheeks . 
"
11951565,3,224,"They were about to decide their next plan of action , and it was imperative she ($_bakugou) had a clear head to focus . It was doubtful Katsuki ($_katsuki) knew anything about the Resistance . In typical bounty hunter fashion , this crew had kept to themselves and their bounty , so it was up to them to fill them in on what had been happening in the world with the_Academy ($_the) . 
"
11951565,3,225,"Sliding the door open , she ($_bakugou) made her ($_bakugou) way down the hall back to the bridge , following the hallway Momo ($_momo) had led them down earlier . There were a few stairs to climb up , but it was mostly a straight shot to the front of the ship . 
"
11951565,3,226,"She ($_bakugou) punched in the code for the main bridge , sliding the door open to find she ($_bakugou) was one of the first people there , minus Momo ($_momo) , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , and the boy with interesting colored hair . In front of them was a large blue screen , flashing her ($_bakugou) picture and ... a file ? It looked like a file ? What ... had they found ? Her ($_bakugou) face turned bright red . Were they ... researching her ($_bakugou) ? 
"
11951565,3,227,"""What's...going on here?"" she ($_bakugou) found herself ($_bakugou) saying , though her ($_bakugou) voice was n't very loud . 
"
11951565,3,228,"`` O-Ochako ! '' Momo ($_momo) gasped , turning around . 
"
11951565,3,229,"The quiet boy turned around as well , folding his arms with a scoff , as though he was annoyed to have been caught . `` It 's a background check . We needed to be sure you were who you said you were . '' 
"
11951565,3,230,"""What?"" Ochako ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) head . Momo ($_momo) had seemed so friendly to her ($_ochako) . Had she ($_ochako) really come across so untrustworthy ? 
"
11951565,3,231,"`` With the way things are with the_Academy ($_the) , we had to be sure you were actually ... well , you understand ? '' Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) poorly explained . 
"
11951565,3,232,"She ($_ochako) did understand . The_Academy ($_the) had gone on a massacre , killing off all bloodlines of royalty and rulers , and yet here she ($_ochako) was claiming to be a princess . Why would they ($_the) ever believe her ($_ochako) ? Actually , she ($_ochako) 'd been lucky Iida_and_Mina ($_the) had believed her ($_ochako) , though who knew ... perhaps they ($_the) had researched her ($_ochako) behind her ($_ochako) back early on too . 
"
11951565,3,233,"Nodding , she ($_ochako) bowed quickly . `` I-I 'm sorry ! I completely understand , '' she ($_ochako) said . `` The_Academy ($_the) can be ... tricky and there was no other way for you to believe me . I hope my file has cleared things up ? '' 
"
11951565,3,234,"`` You 're definitely a part of the Resistance , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) stated . `` We ($_the) know that much for sure . '' 
"
11951565,3,235,"`` Correct - '' 
"
11951565,3,236,"The door behind them ($_the) slid open , and a few loud stomps alerted them ($_the) to the presence of their ($_the) Captain , Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) . `` What the hell are you ($_the) doing with Uraraka_'s ($_uraraka) picture on that screen ? '' he ($_uraraka) said . His ($_uraraka) hands were tucked into his ($_uraraka) pockets , and he ($_uraraka) was leaning forward , scowling at the picture . 
"
11951565,3,237,"`` It 's just a quick background check , '' Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) said . Momo ($_momo) let out a soft groan , rolling her eyes . 
"
11951565,3,238,"`` Hah ? '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) snapped . `` What in the hell for ? '' 
"
11951565,3,239,"`` No reason , '' Ochako ($_ochako) chimed in quickly . `` Just to see if I was telling the truth about my identity . I mean it makes sense , '' she babbled . `` Princesses are n't supposed to exist anymore , and yet I claim to be one . The only person who can really confirm my story is you and - '' 
"
11951565,3,240,"She stopped speaking , watching as Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) lip twitched . She had a feeling no matter what she said it was going to be too late to stop his anger .

"
11951565,3,250,"`` Yes , excuse me ($_uraraka) for trying to keep your ($_bakugou) damn ship safe , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) hissed , grabbing at Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) wrist .
