10644189,4,1,"Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) was mean . Explosive. Rude . And a thousand other adjectives , but he ($_halfie) wasn t barbaric -LRB- at least , according to Eijirou -RRB- . Which was why he ($_halfie) hated the way his ($_halfie) skin crawled as he ($_halfie) saw the_bigger_Mer ($_the) latch onto the smaller one , trying to grab a hold of Deku ($_deku) and subdue him ($_halfie) . Their eyes met , those striking green eyes and his ($_halfie) own . It was a plea for help . There was no way he ($_halfie) could mistake that for anything else . 
"
10644189,4,2,"He ($_halfie) couldn t remember much about the day he ($_halfie) had almost drowned , but he ($_halfie) recalled the warm arms around him ($_halfie) that brought him ($_halfie) to shore , even if he ($_halfie) had been a brat about it . The way the_Mer ($_the) had smiled and ruffled his ($_halfie) hair with a smile . Kacchan . 
"
10644189,4,3,"With a groan , Bakugou ($_bakugou) pulled out his ($_bakugou) phone . Ei , get here . Watch over Deku ($_deku) . 
"
10644189,4,4,"What s going on ? 
"
10644189,4,5,"Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) s trying to mate with him ($_halfie) . I ($_hitoshi) ll go find Halfie ($_halfie) . 
"
10644189,4,6,"Huh ?! 
"
10644189,4,7,"He ($_halfie) cut the call and sprinted outside , recalling he ($_halfie) had seen the mess of white and red hair up on the deck . Todoroki ($_todoroki) had been away for a while , but the others working at the aquarium told him ($_halfie) about how close the_owner ($_halfie) s son was to the captive Mer . Bakugou ($_bakugou) remembered the disgust in Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) s keeper s eyes after the order from Todoroki_Enji ($_todoroki) reached them . 
"
10644189,4,8,"The_Mer ($_the) is going into heat . Put it ($_the) with the other one and they ($_the) ll both get over it ($_the) faster that way . 
"
10644189,4,9,"It ($_the) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) loathed the word . The_man ($_halfie) had fathered a child with a Mer , and still called them It . He ($_halfie) saw Todoroki in the distance , talking to a group of visitors with a smile on his ($_halfie) face . When the_man ($_halfie) caught sight of him ($_halfie) , he ($_halfie) wrinkled his ($_halfie) nose . Bakugou ($_bakugou) huffed and jogged to a stop , flicking his ($_bakugou) head in the direction he ($_bakugou) had come from . 
"
10644189,4,10,"Deku ($_deku) . 
"
10644189,4,11,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) s eyes took on a different look . What? 
"
10644189,4,12,"The merman . You don t know , do you ? 
"
10644189,4,13,"Know what ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) s face scrunched up in confusion . 
"
10644189,4,14,"Just go to Hitoshi s tank ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) shoved the boy away . I ll take over . 
"
10644189,4,15,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) took one more glance at him ($_bakugou) before running off . Hopefully it wouldn t be too late . 
"
10644189,4,16,"***
"
10644189,4,17,"Shouto ($_shouto) s heart hammered away in his ($_shouto) chest . There had been this urgency in Bakugou ($_bakugou) s voice , a seriousness the half-Mer ($_half-mer) hadn t heard before . He ($_shouto) ran down to Hitoshi s tank , at the other end of the aquarium . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was leaning in against the glass , his ($_shouto) shoulders tense . 
"
10644189,4,18,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked me to come here . 
"
10644189,4,19,"The redhead stepped away , his ($_eijirou) face pale . Todoroki ($_todoroki) ! I don t know what to do ! 
"
10644189,4,20,"What s going on ? Did something happen to Hitoshi ? 
"
10644189,4,21,"As he ($_eijirou) stepped forward to take a look , Eijirou ($_eijirou) muttered , You could say that again . 
"
10644189,4,22,"Shouto ($_shouto) heard the pained shrill before seeing it . Izuku ($_izuku) , pinned onto the sand , his ($_izuku) exposed shoulder bleeding out in a stream of dark violet that clouded the water . His ($_izuku) tail could hardly move , pressed down by the length of Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) s above his ($_izuku) . 
"
10644189,4,23,"It was hard to understand what happened next . Red , hot anger rose within like molten lava , spurting out in scorching quantities . Eijirou ($_eijirou) took a step back as Shouto ($_shouto) ran up to the deck of Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) s tank and dove in . He ($_eijirou) hadn t swum about in a while , but moving came naturally . All he ($_eijirou) knew was that he ($_eijirou) had to keep Izuku ($_izuku) away from the_other_Mer ($_the) , keep him ($_eijirou) from danger . He ($_eijirou) descended onto Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) and shoved the_Mer ($_the) off , snarling . He ($_eijirou) didn t have fangs - but his ($_eijirou) canines were still sharp enough to bite the_Mer ($_the) and claw the long tail . Strangely , Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) only struggled the first minute before he ($_eijirou) backed off and retreated to his ($_eijirou) cave . 
"
10644189,4,24,"Shouto ($_shouto) waited an agonisingly slow moment to see if Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) would come out , but the_Mer ($_the) made no appearance . Swallowing , he ($_shouto) turned back to Izuku , still lying on the sand , his ($_shouto) chest heaving and eyes dilated . 
"
10644189,4,25,"Izuku ($_izuku) ? he ($_shouto) ventured , when the_Mer ($_the) did not turn his ($_shouto) head . There was no response . He ($_shouto) cautiously moved to settle by Izuku ($_izuku) s uninjured shoulder . Beneath all the blood and distress signals , he ($_shouto) could smell a sweet musk that made him ($_shouto) uncomfortable . 
"
10644189,4,26,"Izuku ($_izuku) , I m here . You re safe now , he ($_shouto) murmured , brushing back some of the smaller Mer s hair . Finally , green eyes came back into focus , and a whimper rose into the . Shouto ($_shouto) stilled when arms wrapped tightly around his ($_shouto) neck , pulling him ($_shouto) close . 
"
10644189,4,27,"Mers can t shed tears like humans , he ($_shouto) remembered his ($_shouto) mother telling him ($_shouto) . 
"
10644189,4,28,"He ($_shouto) ran his ($_shouto) hands down Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulder blades , hoping it would help to calm him ($_shouto) down . He ($_shouto) wanted to wreck something as the smaller Mer s body trembled under his ($_shouto) , little tremors he ($_shouto) couldn t seem to control . 
"
10644189,4,29,"You re back . Izuku ($_izuku) s voice was hoarse . Shouto ($_shouto) opened his ($_shouto) mouth , but the words died on his ($_shouto) tongue as Izuku ($_izuku) s imploring eyes searched his ($_shouto) own . Where were you ? 
"
10644189,4,30,"My father sent me away on some work , Shouto ($_shouto) looked down . I didn t know he ($_shouto) d moved you . He ($_shouto) told me I could see you in the evening because they were cleaning your tank . He ($_shouto) laughed , a hollow echo of his ($_shouto) usual ones . 
"
10644189,4,31,"Why did I even trust him ($_shouto) for a second ? Why did he ($_shouto) put you here ? I didn t think Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) would attack anyone like that . 
"
10644189,4,32,"Izuku ($_izuku) looked away , one arm splayed out on the sand . He ($_izuku) wouldn t have . 
"
10644189,4,33,"What? Shouto ($_shouto) asked , his ($_shouto) tone sharp . 
"
10644189,4,34,"He ($_izuku) couldn t help it , probably , Izuku ($_izuku) closed his ($_izuku) eyes , voice breaking . 
"
10644189,4,35,"What do you mean ? 
"
10644189,4,36,"Izuku ($_izuku) forced himself ($_izuku) to look Shouto ($_shouto) in the eyes , his ($_izuku) ears taking on a reddish tinge . It s mating season . 
"
10644189,4,37,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked at Izuku ($_izuku) , absolutely still . 
"
10644189,4,38,"Oh Gods above . How could he ($_izuku) not have realised ? It all made so much sense - And it had never struck him ($_izuku) that Mers would have a mating season . Was that why his ($_izuku) father had put Izuku ($_izuku) in with Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) ? Because the enclosure made it impossible for them to keep distance from each other ? So that Izuku could quickly return to looking pretty for the visitors ? He ($_izuku) could practically taste the bitterness in his ($_izuku) mouth . 
"
10644189,4,39,"Come on , Izuku ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) tugged the_Mer ($_the) up to sitting . What do you say we return to your enclosure ? 
"
10644189,4,40,"Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes widened . We can ? 
"
10644189,4,41,"Shouto ($_shouto) nodded , brushing back a clump of green hair . He ($_shouto) pressed a kiss to Izuku s forehead on instinct , relishing the way the_Mer ($_the) relaxed in his ($_shouto) grip . 
"
10644189,4,42,"Let s go . 
"
10644189,4,43,"He ($_shouto) pulled Izuku ($_izuku) up to the surface when Eijirou ($_eijirou) was standing , with Hitoshi ($_hitoshi) s keeper in tow . 
"
10644189,4,44,"Even if your father fires me ($_momo) , tell him ($_shouto) I ($_momo) had no regrets , she told Shouto , her eyes steely . I ($_momo) ve had enough of his ($_shouto) ridiculous plans . 
"
10644189,4,45,"Thank you ($_momo) , Momo ($_momo) , he ($_shouto) bowed . She nodded , and within half an hour , they had Izuku back in his ($_shouto) tank . The_Mer ($_the) splashed about a little , the colour returning to his ($_shouto) face and he ($_shouto) finally moved into his ($_shouto) cave , curling onto the sand . Shouto ($_shouto) followed him ($_shouto) , pausing at the entrance before he ($_shouto) was given permission to enter . 
"
10644189,4,46,"Shouto ($_shouto) , it ($_shouto) s alright . Just come in. 
"
10644189,4,47,"You re feeling better ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked , entering the cave . There was an alcove built in at the end of the cave , a slightly elevated set of flat boulders with a bed of moss that Izuku ($_izuku) slept on . He ($_izuku) was lying facedown , his ($_izuku) dorsal fin exposed . Shouto ($_shouto) caught sight of a few rivulets of blood trickling upwards . He ($_shouto) frowned and traced the area around the fin , catching sight of a few scratches scattered down Izuku ($_izuku) s back . 
"
10644189,4,48,"Come with me , he ($_shouto) made light taps to Izuku s freckled shoulder . I ll help to treat your cuts . 
"
10644189,4,49,"Izuku ($_izuku) shook his ($_izuku) head , his ($_izuku) eyes half-lidded . I want to sleep . 
"
10644189,4,50,"But-???
"
10644189,4,51,"Please. My injuries aren t much compared to what happens in the ocean . We heal fast . 
"
10644189,4,52,"He ($_izuku) sighed , moving to sit at the sandy bed of the cave , but Izuku ($_izuku) s hand shot out and grasped his ($_izuku) forearm . His ($_izuku) usually expressive orbs now unreadable . 
"
10644189,4,53,"Stay . Please? 
"
10644189,4,54,"Shouto eased himself ($_izuku) to the space next to Izuku s waist and ran his ($_izuku) hands through green curls . I ll be here , he ($_izuku) promised . With a faint smile on his ($_izuku) face , Izuku ($_izuku) nodded off , his ($_izuku) gills flitting open and close as his ($_izuku) breathing evened out . 
"
10644189,4,55,"The half-Mer ($_half-mer) didn t even know he ($_izuku) had been holding his ($_izuku) breath until the tension leaked out and he ($_izuku) relaxed his ($_izuku) shoulders . He ($_izuku) watched the sleeping Mer , running his ($_izuku) eyes over the thick lashes and freckles that dotted Izuku ($_izuku) s skin like stars speckling the night sky . To think that he ($_izuku) had been gone for just a week and this had happened . He ($_izuku) had let Izuku ($_izuku) get hurt . If he ($_izuku) wanted to help the Mer Prince , there was only one person he ($_izuku) could go to . 
"
10644189,4,56,"Shouto ($_shouto) worried his ($_shouto) lip , his ($_shouto) eyes downcast . 
"
10644189,4,57,"With a shuddering breath and solidifying resolve , he ($_shouto) extricated himself ($_shouto) from Izuku ($_izuku) s grasp and swam up to the surface . There was someone he ($_shouto) had to meet .
