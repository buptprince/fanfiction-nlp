11443656,3,1,"They ve only been flying for a few hours when Shouto ($_shouto) notices that Bakugou ($_bakugou) s wings aren t beating quite as steadily anymore . 
"
11443656,3,2,"When they d set off -- first landing again to fashion a makeshift saddle so Shouto ($_shouto) didn t rub his ($_shouto) legs raw on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s sharp scales -- he ($_shouto) d been secretly glad Bakugou ($_bakugou) would be the one to carry him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) didn t like the idea of relying so much on someone who he ($_shouto) had just met , much less being strapped to their back as they hurtled through the sky . 
"
11443656,3,3,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) was familiar . He ($_shouto) knew Bakugou ($_bakugou) , how to piss him ($_shouto) off , how to calm him ($_shouto) down , when to give up and hide until the explosions died down 
"
11443656,3,4,"He ($_shouto) knew Bakugou ($_bakugou) would never admit it , but after being stuck in a tower together for a decade , they d had no choice but to become friends . 
"
11443656,3,5,"It s this unspoken friendship that prompts Shouto ($_shouto) to lean forward and whack Bakugou ($_bakugou) on the neck . 
"
11443656,3,6,"The fuck do you want ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) yells . It s not as fierce as it usually is : a little quieter , a little more out of breath .

11443656,3,10,"Fucking_Bakugou ($_bakugou) takes a breath . He ($_bakugou) sounds more winded with every word . Stopping for a fucking pocketknife . Seriously. 
"
11443656,3,11,"It s a very important pocketknife , Shouto ($_shouto) says placidly . 
"
11443656,3,12,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) knows he ($_bakugou) has plenty of sharp things that could take the place of a pocketknife . He ($_bakugou) d watched him ($_bakugou) pack . He ($_bakugou) also knows that every year upon his ($_bakugou) birthday , a large shipment of every sort of weapon in the appropriate size was delivered to the tower , and that Shouto ($_shouto) never viewed them with any sort of sentimentality . 
"
11443656,3,13,"But above all , Bakugou ($_bakugou) knows that he ($_bakugou) is not going to last much longer , and that a search for a pocketknife provides a convenient excuse for a rest . 
"
11443656,3,14,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) doesn t say anything . His ($_bakugou) muscles are clearly on the point of exhaustion , though , and Shouto ($_shouto) sits back , confident in the knowledge that Bakugou ($_bakugou) s mind is made up . 
"
11443656,3,15,"We re heading down ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) roars before tucking his ($_bakugo) wings in and diving . Midoriya and Shinsou ($_shinsou) hang above them in the sky for a split second before they too tip into dives .

"
11443656,3,17,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) grumbles something lost in the slipstream . It probably involves lots of swearing . 
"
11443656,3,18,"Through all of this , Shouto ($_shouto) is clinging on for dear life , the wind slicing over his ($_shouto) skin like knives . Through blurry eyes , he ($_shouto) sees the faint blur of the ground resolving into things like rocks and trees and shouldn t Bakugou ($_bakugou) be pulling out of the dive about now ? 
"
11443656,3,19,"Muscles shift beneath him ($_shouto) and suddenly Bakugou ($_bakugou) is doing exactly that . Shouto ($_shouto) pitches forwards , forearms hitting scales and head hitting forearms . 
"
11443656,3,20,"Ow . 
"
11443656,3,21,"Maybe he ($_shouto) should get a helmet or something . 
"
11443656,3,22,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) comes out of the dive higher and gentler than either Midoriya or Shinsou ($_shinsou) , both of whom fall farther before snapping their wings open and levelling out . They drift down from there , soft as feathers on the breeze . 
"
11443656,3,23,"When they land , Midoriya ($_midoriya) immediately rushes up , concern plain in his ($_midoriya) eyes , and asks , What s wrong ? 
"
11443656,3,24,"I dropped something , Shouto ($_shouto) says , stepping over the row of spikes to his ($_shouto) side and preparing to make his ($_shouto) way down Bakugou ($_bakugou) s leg . He ($_shouto) ll have to be careful to avoid the sharp hooks sprouting from his ($_shouto) elbows , as well . 
"
11443656,3,25,"... Bakugou didn t seem nearly this tall when he ($_shouto) first climbed into the saddle . 
"
11443656,3,26,"We stopped half a day before we were supposed to because the princeling dropped something ? Shinsou ($_shinsou) says , curling his ($_shinsou) lip . 
"
11443656,3,27,"Shouto ($_shouto) shrugs . It ($_shouto) was a very important item . 
"

11443656,3,33,"He ($_midoriya) glances at Bakugou , who s now flat on the ground , eyelids drooping and tongue lolling . Even the habitual sparking around his ($_midoriya) flared horns is gone . 
"
11443656,3,34,"Shouto ($_shouto) can t help but wince in sympathy . If he ($_midoriya) s not even bothering to keep up the usual small explosions , he ($_midoriya) must really be worn out .

11443656,3,35,"Shinsou ($_shinsou) draws himself ($_shinsou) up , ready to deliver what will no doubt be a blistering diatribe , when Midoriya ($_midoriya) speaks again . 
"
11443656,3,36,"You know , I m getting a little tired , he ($_midoriya) says , faking a yawn . Maybe we should rest for a bit while Todoroki searches . 
"
11443656,3,37,"... you flew for three days straight on the way down . 
"
11443656,3,38,"Then I guess it s catching up to me . He ($_midoriya) pokes at his ($_midoriya) harness with a claw until it s loose enough to wiggle free before promptly shifting . He ($_midoriya) clasps his ($_midoriya) hands together and stretches his ($_midoriya) arms up , twisting from side to side . His ($_midoriya) back cracks . 
"
11443656,3,39,"But -- we can t stop now , it ll throw the whole schedule off -- 
"
11443656,3,40,"Shouto doesn t bother to pay any further attention to their argument . It s clear Midoriya ($_midoriya) s going to wear Shinsou ($_shinsou) down . 
"
11443656,3,41,"Instead , he ($_midoriya) nudges Bakugou ($_bakugou) s leg . Shift . 
"

"
11443656,3,43,"Shift or I m telling Shinsou ($_shinsou) about the time you got your head stuck in a sword rack .

"
11443656,3,45,"... asshole . 
"
11443656,3,46,"Shouto ($_shouto) nods to himself ($_shouto) in satisfaction . He ($_shouto) steps away from Bakugou ($_bakugou) once he ($_shouto) feels the scales at his ($_shouto) back ripple , signalling the shift . 
"

"
11443656,3,48,"Shouto ($_shouto) just shrugs . 
"
11443656,3,49,"On the other side of the clearing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) seems to have finally won the argument by simply flopping down on the ground and falling asleep . 
"
11443656,3,50,"Impressive, really. 
"
11443656,3,51,"Shinsou ($_shinsou) s given up , resorting to pacing irritably at the edge of the trees . His ($_shouto) tail has left a rather nice wavy pattern in the dirt behind him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) doesn t seem like he ($_shouto) ll make any more effort to continue . 
"
11443656,3,52,"Good.

11443656,3,64,"Shouto ($_shouto) glances at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . He ($_shouto) s still out cold , has been since Shouto ($_shouto) found his ($_shouto) way back and sat down with a book . A half-empty bag of mysterious jerky lies by his ($_shouto) head . Midoriya ($_midoriya) had claimed it replenished a vast amount of energy , but as it had a smell vaguely reminiscent of rat droppings , Shouto ($_shouto) decided to give it a pass .
