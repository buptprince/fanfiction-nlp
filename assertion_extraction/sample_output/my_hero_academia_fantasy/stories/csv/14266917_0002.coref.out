14266917,2,1,"I ll tell you then , how certain stories start before they tell you they do . For example , this one starts a bit earlier than you might think . 
"
14266917,2,2,"No , it didn t start when the_King ($_the) fell in love with the princess . Or when he ($_the) became King . It didn t even start when he ($_the) was born . 
"
14266917,2,3,"To be fair , it doesn t even start with the_King ($_the) . 
"
14266917,2,4,"It starts , in a faraway place from The Kingdom of Lucifer . It starts in the Millennium Forest , where a_woman ($_inko) traveled at night , holding her ($_inko) new-born child in her ($_inko) arms . That_woman ($_inko) was Midoriya Inko . And that s when I first met the servant of Lucifer . 
"
14266917,2,5,"At that time , he was nothing more than a baby . His impact on this story that shaped countries , was nothing more than a vague illusion trapped in my eternal mind . 
"
14266917,2,6,"I followed them close by , as per usual my job is . It was not weird to follow her ($_inko) since the snow that reached her ($_inko) knees was cold enough for even reindeers to shiver . 
"
14266917,2,7,"If you had asked me back then , I would have told you her ($_inko) actions were foolish . The end was inevitable . Only a miracle could be the one to save her ($_inko) , and I was not one to easily believe in them . 
"
14266917,2,8,"But nevertheless , she ($_inko) kept on walking . Fighting against the cold wind , the skin freezing cold , the snow that piled up . She ($_inko) hugged tightly on to the baby in her ($_inko) arms , choosing to give the smallest amount of warmth to the tiny one s body . It was working , if barely . 
"
14266917,2,9,"The child was alive . For now. 
"
14266917,2,10,"It didn t take long for her ($_inko) to reach her ($_inko) limit , staggering as she ($_inko) walked . Soon , her ($_inko) body fell on the snow , and the child cried in her ($_inko) arms . 
"
14266917,2,11,"Please , she ($_inko) cried in desperation . Please . 
"
14266917,2,12,"She ($_inko) was begging to no god . I reached for her ($_inko) , caressing cold cheeks . I stared into her ($_inko) eyes , ready to help her ($_inko) up . 
"
14266917,2,13,"But I hesitated . 
"
14266917,2,14,"She ($_inko) made me hesitate . For a second , for a moment . 
"
14266917,2,15,"With her ($_inko) eyes that screamed , please . 
"
14266917,2,16,"And hesitation was all it took . 
"
14266917,2,17,"Madame , the man in a carriage said . She ($_inko) looked up to see the man offering her ($_inko) hand . Where are you heading ? 
"
14266917,2,18,"She ($_inko) smiled . Thanking in her ($_inko) mind , in her ($_inko) soul , whatever deity she ($_inko) had once forsaken . She ($_inko) reached for his hand , grateful for the opportunity given . 
"
14266917,2,19,"I frowned , aware that this did not change much . I was to take her ($_inko) with me , before midnight . I followed after them , as the carriage worked its way through the snow . Inko , the kind woman , began talking with the man . It was her ($_inko) way of staying sane , after looking me in the eyes . 
"
14266917,2,20,"We re heading to the Kingdom of Ignis , she ($_inko) said . Her ($_inko) voice trembled in cold as I held her ($_inko) hand tightly . 
"
14266917,2,21,"What a coincidence , the man replied . I m heading there too . 
"
14266917,2,22,"Oh , dear heavens , she ($_inko) sighed in content . Relief washed over her ($_inko) face , holding the infant s body tight into her ($_inko) embrace . If there s a god up there , I m glad he heard me . 
"
14266917,2,23,"But what is a lonely woman like you traveling all alone ? the man asked . He was genuinely curious . His voice indicated so . What about your husband ? 
"
14266917,2,24,"We re going to meet him , actually , Inko ($_inko) replied . Her ($_inko) smile widened as she ($_inko) traced the baby s face . I peeked over her ($_inko) shoulder , amazed by the resemblance of them_both ($_inko) . I wanted to reach out and touch his face . But that was not allowed . I was not to take him . 
"
14266917,2,25,"Not today , at least . 
"
14266917,2,26,"He is from Ignis ? the man asked with a frown . Then maybe I know him . All the work there is the same . 
"
14266917,2,27,"Oh no , Inko ($_inko) laughed . He ($_inko) doesn t work in the same field , I m afraid . He ($_inko) works at the palace . 
"
14266917,2,28,"The palace ? the man asked , perplexed . If he ($_inko) works at the palace , why are you two out here in the cold ? 
"
14266917,2,29,"Inko ($_inko) lead her ($_inko) finger to her ($_inko) lips . They were blue with a tinge of purple in the center , looking dry like ashes in a pit . 
"
14266917,2,30,"The man smiled at this . He himself had a lover , after all . One he loved with the deepest of his soul . He d do anything for them . 
"
14266917,2,31,"My name is Inko Midoriya , by the way , she ($_izuku) said instead . 
"
14266917,2,32,"Hizashi_Yamada ($_hizashi) , he ($_hizashi) introduced himself ($_hizashi) with a smile . And who is that_little_guy_over_there ($_hizashi) ? 
"
14266917,2,33,"Izuku ($_izuku) , she ($_izuku) answered . A proud smile flowered in her ($_izuku) face , like a magnolia on May . Midoriya Izuku . 
"
14266917,2,34,"He ($_hizashi) s pretty cute , Hizashi ($_hizashi) commented . He ($_hizashi) takes it from you ! 
"
14266917,2,35,"Oh , my , thank you , Inko ($_inko) laughed a bit , the blush on her ($_inko) face barely tinted pink . But I m afraid he takes it from his father . 
"
14266917,2,36,"I m sorry madam , but I it s hard to believe it when you re the prettiest woman that has gotten in this carriage , the man continued to say . There was a sad smile on his face . He probably noticed me . Not in my appearance , but Inko ($_inko) s. My presence was beginning to take a toll on her ($_inko) body . It was only a matter of time . We re almost there , Inko ($_inko) . So, hang in there, okay? 
"
14266917,2,37,"I wanted him to meet his father , Inko ($_inko) said . A single tear streamed down her ($_inko) face . Her ($_inko) eyelids felt heavy in her ($_inko) eyes . I m kinder than they might let you think . I encouraged her ($_inko) to look down , to look at her ($_inko) child . I gave her ($_inko) a few more moments , a few more seconds , to breathe out her ($_inko) last words . Izuku ($_izuku) , be a nice kid , okay ? 
"
14266917,2,38,"She ($_inko) went limp against the seat . The_little_baby ($_inko) blinked awake and began talking . It was a baby talk which few were the ones to comprehend . 
"
14266917,2,39,"But I could , for I had been a mother once . 
"
14266917,2,40,"Mommy , he called . Despite how serious I took my job , taking away a mother from her ($_inko) child was always when I hesitated the most . 
"
14266917,2,41,"Out of the pity of my heart , I let Inko ($_inko) caress her ($_inko) child s cheeks with her ($_inko) soul . Since that was all there was left of her ($_inko) . 
"
14266917,2,42,"The child stopped babbling and went back to sleep . 
"
14266917,2,43,"Time to go , I told her ($_inko) . You could say I was running late , but it was not quite . I was always where I needed to be at the time I needed to be , but this one just seemed like a little pointless detour . 
"
14266917,2,44,"She ($_inko) didn t fight me . Most people do , especially if they still wanted to stay . But I guess she ($_inko) had sensed me from the moment I touched her ($_inko) . The fact that she ($_inko) had a few more minutes to live , had been more than enough for her ($_inko) . 
"
14266917,2,45,"Her ($_inko) soul followed me without a single complaint . 
"
14266917,2,46,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) continued his ($_hizashi) travel across the border , his ($_hizashi) silent tears the only warmth left in the place . The child would live enough to reach the_Kingdom_of_Ignis ($_the) Ignis ($_ignis) , sealing the fate of its ($_the) people . 
"
14266917,2,47,"I knew , even then , that there was something off . Inko ($_inko) hadn t been able to evade her ($_inko) destiny , but her ($_inko) child had . And now , the child that had escaped my grasp was heading into a country known for its ($_the) brutality , in a slave trader s carriage . 
"
14266917,2,48,"It ($_the) was a ticking bomb . 
"
14266917,2,49,"Nevertheless , I continued my job . It ($_the) s not Death s job to worry about the living . 
"
14266917,2,50,"I met the_King_Lucifer_'s ($_the) mother before I met him ($_the) . 
"
14266917,2,51,"She was still pregnant when I walked into her room . But my presence there was still weak . She did not see me , I don t think anyone sensed me . 
"
14266917,2,52,"Mistuki Bakugou , the Queen of Ignis ($_ignis) . The fairest of all , with golden hair and golden eyes . Strong like a bear , pretty like a hummingbird . 
"
14266917,2,53,"By her side , her husband stood . The glint in his eyes was obvious . He loved the woman like Eros loved Psyche . Probably a bit more , if you stared at their joined hands . I sat close by . 
"
14266917,2,54,"Have you thought of a name ? she asked , rubbing her belly with care . The eyes of a mother shone through her soul . 
"
14266917,2,55,"You have turned down every name I ve given you , the man , the King , said with a laugh . 
"
14266917,2,56,"That s because all the names you chose are too weak , she replied with a huff . He ($_mitsuki) s going to be the King , Masaru ($_masaru) . I want his ($_mitsuki) name to be remembered . To be a name that strikes fear and glory . 
"
14266917,2,57,"He ($_mitsuki) s your child , Masaru ($_masaru) said , kissing the hand of his ($_mitsuki) wife . She blushed at this , feeling the warmth spread through her face . Whatever his ($_mitsuki) name is , he ($_mitsuki) ll strike glory . 
"
14266917,2,58,"Okay , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) smiled . She rubbed small circles in her husband s hands . You pick . Whatever the name you say , that will be his . 
"
14266917,2,59,"Katsuki_,_Masaru ($_katsuki) replied . His ($_katsuki) eyes locked on Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) s , as he ($_katsuki) pronounced the name of his ($_katsuki) son . To win . 
"
14266917,2,60,"That s perfect , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) breathed out . She ($_mitsuki) closed her ($_mitsuki) eyes and simply continued , my water broke . 
"
14266917,2,61,"After a long journey , Hizashi ($_hizashi) arrived at the capital of Ignis ($_ignis) . He ($_hizashi) had buried Inko ($_inko) near the border , where the snow had mostly melted down . There was a hidden longing inside of him ($_hizashi) , to tell someone what had happened . But he ($_hizashi) couldn t bring himself ($_hizashi) to do so . People at the palace were scary . If Hizashi ($_hizashi) gave them a reason , without a doubt he ($_hizashi) would be hanged . 
"
14266917,2,62,"So , instead , he ($_hizashi) reached the capital with a baby in hands . 
"
14266917,2,63,"What s that ? his ($_hizashi) lover asked when Hizashi ($_hizashi) reached home . 
"
14266917,2,64,"A baby , he ($_hizashi) simply answered . A woman gave it to me . 
"
14266917,2,65,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) stared at the baby in his ($_aizawa) lover s arms with a raised eyebrow . 
"
14266917,2,66,"We can t keep it , he ($_aizawa) said . 
"
14266917,2,67,"I know , Hizashi ($_hizashi) replied . He ($_aizawa) looked at the small baby in his ($_aizawa) arms , and guilt swallowed him ($_aizawa) . 
"
14266917,2,68,"He ($_aizawa) was too much of a coward to kill a baby . Not after watching a woman die to keep him ($_aizawa) alive . 
"
14266917,2,69,"But deep down , he ($_aizawa) knew Death would have been a better option than the one he ($_aizawa) was presented with . He ($_aizawa) caressed Izuku s hair , not wanting to let go of the child . 
"
14266917,2,70,"There s no way for us to feed him ($_aizawa) , Aizawa ($_aizawa) said again . There was a little less compassion in his ($_aizawa) voice , but Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew it was not out of lack of empathy . On the contrary . Too much empathy was perhaps his ($_aizawa) lover s biggest quality . 
"
14266917,2,71,"If the boy stayed with them , there was no way he d live . 
"
14266917,2,72,"You need to take him to her , Aizawa ($_aizawa) continued . 
"
14266917,2,73,"Hizashi didn t want to do it . His heart was too fragile to hand the baby over . Much less to - 
"
14266917,2,74,"He s going to die , if he stays with us , Aizawa ($_aizawa) kept on saying . 
"
14266917,2,75,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew it . 
"
14266917,2,76,"They were poor , way too poor . Even if he starved and gave all his food to the baby , it wouldn t survive . He had spent so many hours protecting the small creature from the snow , and he would be dead in a matter of days . 
"
14266917,2,77,"There were only two options now . 
"
14266917,2,78,"It was either death or Midnight . 
"
14266917,2,79,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) stared at Aizawa ($_aizawa) in the eyes . He ($_hizashi) was scared , and Aizawa ($_aizawa) could see so . It wasn t an easy choice , they both knew that . Aizawa ($_aizawa) took the baby from Hizashi ($_hizashi) s arms , as the man he ($_aizawa) had fallen in love with trembled in anguish . 
"
14266917,2,80,"If we manage to save some money , Aizawa ($_aizawa) said , tracing the baby s cheeks with his fingers . We might be able to get him back when he s older . 
"
14266917,2,81,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew it was a lie . There was no way they could save up enough money to buy him back . But it was a wishful thinking . They had , after all , some years to save up . 
"
14266917,2,82,"It wasn t a dream that was possible , but the fantasy of saving the child was enough to give Hizashi ($_hizashi) his ($_hizashi) own breath back . It was enough to let him ($_hizashi) stand up and make up his ($_hizashi) mind . 
"
14266917,2,83,"You heard that , little guy ? Hizashi ($_hizashi) cooed at Izuku , who was peacefully dreaming in Aizawa ($_aizawa) s arms . It was a lovely image . If fate hadn t placed them in such an awful position , he would have loved to have a baby too . We ll save you . 
"
14266917,2,84,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) smiled . 
"
14266917,2,85,"We ll take him to Midnight s in the morning , Aizawa ($_aizawa) said . For now I think we should go to sleep . 
"
14266917,2,86,"I took Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) s hand when she ($_mitsuki) first saw Katsuki ($_katsuki) . He ($_katsuki) was bathed in blood and placenta , only covered in a piece of cloth . 
"
14266917,2,87,"Let me hold him ($_katsuki) , she ($_mitsuki) begged . To both the doctors and to me . I let go of her ($_mitsuki) already cold hand , just to grant her ($_mitsuki) dying wish . 
"
14266917,2,88,"The baby looked so small in her ($_mitsuki) arms . So weak and so powerless. This was the , soon to be , King of Hell . But in her ($_mitsuki) arms , he ($_katsuki) was just Katsuki ($_katsuki) . Son of Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) . Angel on earth . 
"
14266917,2,89,"All humans looked so peaceful when they are just born . 
"
14266917,2,90,"It looks like you , I couldn t help saying . The gift of life was something that always marveled me , as someone whose job was focused on ending it . I very rarely held babies , which only made me want to touch them even more . 
"
14266917,2,91,"I held myself back from placing my hand on him . I took Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) s hand instead . 
"
14266917,2,92,"She ($_mitsuki) was a tough girl , who didn t come with me willingly . Her ($_mitsuki) spirit was something to be reckoned with , for even in Death she ($_mitsuki) stayed strong . But she ($_mitsuki) didn t put a fight either , knowing full well it was a lost fight . She ($_mitsuki) simply staggered , buying time . Kissing her ($_mitsuki) child . Smelling his hair . Touching his skin . Crying his name . 
"
14266917,2,93,"I am , if anything , patient and let her ($_mitsuki) tire herself ($_mitsuki) out . Everyone does . 
"
14266917,2,94,"She ($_mitsuki) closed her ($_mitsuki) eyes and came with me . I expected for her ($_mitsuki) soul to be angry at me , but it wasn t . It was only longing to stay . When I said so , she ($_mitsuki) came with me without complaining . 
"
14266917,2,95,"Masaru ($_masaru) cried his ($_masaru) wife s loss . For a week , he ($_masaru) refused to touch his ($_masaru) child , too heartbroken to even look at him ($_masaru) . He ($_masaru) forgot his ($_masaru) duties as a ruler and as a father , drowning himself ($_masaru) in tears and alcohol . It was a sad sight , for a once powerful ruler to be left into nothing more than ashes . And why? For love . 
"
14266917,2,96,"Love does not conquer Death , I m afraid . There are few who rule over me . One of them is Fate . And the other is Life . 
"
14266917,2,97,"Love is someone I often encounter but never speak with . I m sure they hate me . But they hate themselves more . I do not hate them , I don t have the luxury to do that . 
"
14266917,2,98,"Masaru ($_masaru) continued to cry in his ($_masaru) bed , for minutes , for hours , for days Soon , everyone started worrying about their King . Wondering if he ($_masaru) might recover . If he ($_masaru) , perhaps , would one day be the loving King who ruled by Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) s side . 
"
14266917,2,99,"They kept wondering and wondering they would keep their minds . 
"
14266917,2,100,"By the five-day mark , the whole palace stopped working altogether . It was something they call a Black Week . They were mourning - weird concept - the loss of a great Queen . An amazing leader . A proud wife and lover . 
"
14266917,2,101,"Sunday to Saturday , everyone dressed in black . Giving the prayers to the now dead Queen , as if she herself were a deity . I stared at them because the prayers were to me . Asking me , why I took her . Why her ? Why not them ? Why not the heir ? 
"
14266917,2,102,"I found those kinds of human the most pitiful of all . Were they foolish enough to believe their desires ruled my decisions ? 
"
14266917,2,103,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) was handed Izuku ($_izuku) by Aizawa ($_aizawa) once they woke up . They were sitting on the bed , the coldness of early winter still fresh in their windows . Aizawa ($_aizawa) looked over Hizashi ($_hizashi) s shoulder , as the man cradled the boy in his arms . 
"
14266917,2,104,"Tears filled the blonde s eyes as he simply whispered , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
14266917,2,105,"Don ($_don) t name him , Aizawa ($_aizawa) had suggested . It s easier to get attached that way . 
"
14266917,2,106,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew . Unfortunately , it was already too late for those kinds of warnings . His ($_hizashi) heart had already warmed up to the little baby , who sucked on his ($_hizashi) thumb like it were a bottle . 
"
14266917,2,107,"But that was something he ($_hizashi) needn t say to Aizawa . Probably because his ($_hizashi) lover already knew . 
"
14266917,2,108,"We could keep him ($_hizashi) , Hizashi ($_hizashi) suggested . 
"
14266917,2,109,"He ($_hizashi) could also die , Aizawa ($_aizawa) interjected . The blankets were wrapped around his ($_hizashi) body , twisting when he ($_hizashi) moved . It s early winter , and we barely managed to keep him ($_hizashi) warm . Not to mention milk - . 
"
14266917,2,110,"Yeah , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said with a sigh . He ($_hizashi) knew . That didn t prevent him ($_hizashi) from dreaming . He ($_hizashi) s going to be better off with Midnight . 
"
14266917,2,111,"He ($_hizashi) will be alive with her , Aizawa ($_aizawa) made sure to mark the emphasis on the word alive . It s not the same thing . 
"
14266917,2,112,"Alive is better than death , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said . Izuku ($_izuku) began sobbing in his ($_izuku) arms . The little thing was hungry . Hizashi ($_hizashi) wished there was a way for him ($_izuku) to feed him ($_izuku) . But all they had were dried food . They lasted longer that way . 
"
14266917,2,113,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) had the words on the tip of his ($_aizawa) mouth . The words to tell Hizashi ($_hizashi) depends who you ask . Or perhaps, ???is better to be dead and free, than alive and trapped. 
"
14266917,2,114,"But they both knew those things . There was no point in reminding Hizashi ($_hizashi) that the fate which awaited the child was worse than death . 
"
14266917,2,115,"You think I can hold him ($_izuku) for a bit longer ? he ($_izuku) asked . 
"
14266917,2,116,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) nodded lightly , although he ($_izuku) knew it was the wrong choice . After all , all they were doing was grow more affectionate towards the child . 
"
14266917,2,117,"It s so small , Hizashi ($_hizashi) murmured . I don t think I ve held something so small , ever . 
"
14266917,2,118,"Izuku ($_izuku) was calm in Hizashi ($_hizashi) s arms . He ($_izuku) rubbed his ($_izuku) small head on his ($_izuku) clothes , yawning as he ($_izuku) babbled . It tugged at Hizashi ($_hizashi) s heart , to see such a small thing that had done anything wrong . So weak and so innocent , staring into Hizashi s eyes with absolute trust . 
"
14266917,2,119,"And Hizashi ($_hizashi) was about to give him ($_izuku) away . 
"
14266917,2,120,"It s a baby , of course , it s small , Aizawa ($_aizawa) intervened , reaching to touch the baby s cheeks . It was soft underneath his ($_izuku) roughed and calloused hands . 
"
14266917,2,121,"Izuku ($_izuku) then gave them the faintest of smiles . It was toothless and tiny . His ($_izuku) mouth barely opened , eyes still closed . 
"
14266917,2,122,"I think he ($_izuku) likes you , Hizashi ($_hizashi) joked , moving his ($_hizashi) body so his ($_hizashi) lover had better access to the baby .

14266917,2,123,"Don ($_don) t joke , Aizawa ($_aizawa) lightly scolded . 
"
14266917,2,124,"But when his ($_hizashi) eyes landed on Izuku ($_izuku) once again , he ($_hizashi) couldn t hide his ($_hizashi) own smile . Izuku ($_izuku) reached out for his ($_izuku) thumb with a tiny hand . He ($_izuku) tugged at it , softly and with no strength . 
"
14266917,2,125,"You little runt , Aizawa ($_aizawa) said , allowing a smile as dim as the light of a burnout candle to settle on his ($_aizawa) lips . 
"
14266917,2,126,"The_king ($_the) finally stopped his ($_the) mourning , a week and four days after his ($_the) wife s death . Or well , he ($_the) stopped physically mourning . His ($_the) heart still ached , his ($_the) eyes still got wet , and his ($_the) body still missed her . 
"
14266917,2,127,"But regardless of what his ($_the) own heart was wishing for , he ($_the) knew for a fact that keeping his ($_the) behavior as it was , would only bring pain to his ($_the) people .

14266917,2,128,"So , he ($_the) gathered himself ($_the) up from the bed . He ($_the) let go of his ($_the) wife s pendant , the last thing that remained of her above the soil . He ($_the) put on new clothes .

14266917,2,129,"His ($_the) footsteps echoed across the palace when he ($_the) finally stepped out of his ($_the) room . Everyone stared at the soulless king that walked like a ghost in between halls , trying to reach the throne .

14266917,2,130,"Please , he ($_the) begged when he ($_the) stared down at the throne . There were two seats . One for the_Queen ($_the) . One for the_King ($_the) . Take it away .

14266917,2,131,"He ($_the) pointed at the_queen_s_seat ($_the) . Eyes were pointed at him ($_the) , unsure of how to react . It was his ($_the) advisor who stepped forward , with a raised eyebrow in concern .

14266917,2,134,"With the finality of his ($_masaru) voice , the advisor nodded slowly . He ($_masaru) instructed the guards to take away the giant seat that served as the throne . It was heavy , so it took a while for it to be removed . But as soon as it was , Masaru ($_masaru) dropped to his ($_masaru) own throne and spoke . 
"
14266917,2,135,"I ll resume my activities as the_king ($_the) , with a determined voice . It was the voice of a tired , washed away king . I apologize , as a ruler , for my absence in the seat of power . 
"
14266917,2,136,"The palace began then buzzing with energy once again . Cooks prepared extravagant dinners , maids began cleaning every bit of dust there was , nobles started sorting the paperwork they let pile up , and servants - Servants never really took a break , so they barely noticed an increase of work on their shoulders . 
"
14266917,2,137,"It was not perfect . The absence of the_queen ($_the) was undeniable ; a lingering black mist of grief hanging in the air , which no one dared to point out . But it was good enough . It was just a matter of time , after all , before things fell into place . Soon , everyone would grow used to this . 
"
14266917,2,138,"Everyone would come to accept this grim-like air , as the norm . Everything would be perfectly fine , in a matter of years , they reassure themselves . 
"
14266917,2,139,"The midwife neared the advisor with shaking hands . In her arms , was the last thing that Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) had held and seen . A bundled up little creature with white blankets covering its body . It was bigger than average since it was being fed by the concubines in the palace . 
"
14266917,2,140,"He s a healthy child , the midwife pointed out . She handed with her bony cold hands , the little heir to the advisor . The_king ($_the) will be proud . 
"
14266917,2,141,"The advisor smiled , thanking in a silent voice the woman s effort . 
"
14266917,2,142,"Cradled in his arms , the little heir was comfortably nuzzled . A belly full , warmth in his body , sleeping peacefully . 
"
14266917,2,143,"You have your mother s looks , The advisor said with a fond laugh . Let s go see your dad , shall we ? 
"
14266917,2,144,"The advisor reached for the_king ($_the) s throne , holding the baby close by . It was warm against his ($_the) chest and small in comparison to his ($_the) tall body . If he ($_the) were still serving the military , the baby would have seemed even smaller . 
"
14266917,2,145,"Your majesty , he ($_the) said . The_king ($_the) was looking through papers , making sure everything was in order . 
"
14266917,2,146,"The_king ($_the) looked up from his ($_the) hands , towards the advisor . His ($_the) eyes were nothing more than glassy leaves , overrun by time . 
"
14266917,2,147,"What is it ? the_king ($_the) asked . 
"
14266917,2,148,"The advisor stretched out his hands , to show the boy to the king . He was not an emotional man , but a baby was a baby . It was a pure child , who didn t know better . Whose faults were yet tainted by the world ... 
"
14266917,2,149,"So , when the_king ($_the) reached out and pushed the boy away , the advisor felt bad for the kid . The eyes that were once empty now were filled with rage . The little boy started crying in his arms . 
"
14266917,2,150,"Get that thing away from me , the king spat , turning away from the child . It is the reason why Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) is no longer here . 
"
14266917,2,151,"The advisor did not enjoy the way the_king ($_the) called the baby it . But he was nothing more than an advisor . He couldn t raise his voice and speak out to the king . He simply nodded . 
"
14266917,2,152,"Are you sure of it ? he asked once again , simply to clarify . 
"
14266917,2,153,"The_king ($_the) s eyes narrowed and looked for a minute to the baby . His eyes softened ever so slightly at the sight . 
"
14266917,2,154,"The baby , after all , resembled Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) a lot . 
"
14266917,2,155,"It then opened his eyes . 
"
14266917,2,156,"They were fiery red , like one of the many paintings that adorned the castle . Red eyes that burnt like boiling blood . They were locked on Masaru ($_masaru) s , as the baby laughed . 
"
14266917,2,157,"This is not my child , Masaru ($_masaru) spat . This is a demon . A creature from hell . 
"
14266917,2,158,"The child laughed , unaware of what was being said to him . The advisor lowered his head , taking the child away . 
"
14266917,2,159,"This was the heir to the throne , whether the_king ($_the) wished for it or not . 
"
14266917,2,160,"Yagi , the advisor called for the one guarding the_king ($_the) s door . Only the most elite of knights would be appointed to guard the_king ($_the) . 
"
14266917,2,161,"What is it ? the knight asked . 
"
14266917,2,162,"You have served war , am I wrong ? 
"
14266917,2,163,"No , you re not , the knight answered . During times of need , I was the one who led our troops into the battlefield and won . 
"
14266917,2,164,"Then , you shall take care of him now , the advisor then said . He handed the knight the infant , who simply babbled in obliviousness . Raise an heir who will be worthy of the throne . 
"
14266917,2,165,"The knight looked baffled at the child in his hands . 
"
14266917,2,166,"I m sorry , sir , but I m a warrior . Not a caretaker , Yagi ($_yagi) said , trying to hand the baby back . 
"
14266917,2,167,"That s exactly what we need , the advisor replied . We don t need a baby . We need a king . This one won t hold up much longer . 
"
14266917,2,168,"Yagi ($_yagi) stared at the child in his ($_yagi) arms . It was just a child , but he ($_yagi) was thought as a king already . He ($_yagi) sighed . 
"
14266917,2,169,"I will try my best . 
"
14266917,2,170,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) got out of the carriage with sluggish movements . He ($_hizashi) still didn t want to do this . He ($_hizashi) hated the idea of doing this . 
"
14266917,2,171,"But there was no other option , was there ? 
"
14266917,2,172,"Oh , Hizashi ($_hizashi) , Midnight called , as she walked away from her house . It was small . Really small. It was barely enough for one person , but that was the only way she could survive . What brings you here ? 
"
14266917,2,173,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) bit his ($_hizashi) lip , feeling guilt swallow him ($_hizashi) up . Izuku ($_izuku) cried in his ($_izuku) arms , making Midnight look over to the kid . He ($_izuku) dropped to his ($_izuku) knees , stretching out his ($_izuku) arms to show the little kid . 
"
14266917,2,174,"Is that - , she asked , but couldn t finish . 
"
14266917,2,175,"His ($_izuku) mother died , Hizashi answered before Midnight ($_midnight) had the time to think much about it . You know I m not one to ask for favors but - Nemuri , please . 
"
14266917,2,176,"Midnight ($_midnight) looked over to Hizashi . Her eyes were unreadable as she took in the image of the baby before her . 
"
14266917,2,177,"I can t take care of a baby , Nemuri ($_nemuri) said , perplexed . I can t even take care of myself . 
"
14266917,2,178,"We re not asking you to take care of it , Aizawa ($_aizawa) interrupted , stepping out the carriage . We are giving him ($_aizawa) to you . 
"
14266917,2,179,"Nemuri ($_nemuri) looked down at the baby . 
"
14266917,2,180,"Babies are hard to keep , she ($_nemuri) said . The cold tone of her ($_nemuri) voice overcame her ($_nemuri) previous kind one . Business was different from friends , after all . If you expect me to pay for him ($_aizawa) - 
"
14266917,2,181,"Not pay , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said quickly . Midnight ($_midnight) raised an eyebrow at the disgusted tone of Hizashi ($_hizashi) s voice . What? Wasn t he always selling her ($_nemuri) people ? But well , those were adults , she ($_nemuri) guessed . We just want him ($_aizawa) to survive . 
"
14266917,2,182,"You re giving him ($_aizawa) away , it wasn t a question . She ($_nemuri) blinked . Are you aware of what you re doing ? 
"
14266917,2,183,"Far too aware , Aizawa ($_aizawa) replied . It s the only option . 
"
14266917,2,184,"Midnight ($_midnight) nodded . She ($_nemuri) didn t like her ($_nemuri) job , but they were right . To most , this was the only way to survive . She ($_nemuri) gave them food , they gave her ($_nemuri) money . 
"
14266917,2,185,"Young ones sell better , she ($_nemuri) clarified . Her ($_nemuri) arms reached for the child , looking at it with care . If I want to gain back my investments , I should be selling him ($_aizawa) by five . 
"
14266917,2,186,"Twelve ! Hizashi ($_hizashi) yelled . Sell him ($_aizawa) by twelve ! I ll pay you ! 
"
14266917,2,187,"Midnight ($_midnight) looked up , with a soft blink . 
"
14266917,2,188,"But what if you don t ? Midnight ($_midnight) asked . I ll lose a lot of money by putting off his sale for ten years more . 
"
14266917,2,189,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) couldn t come up with a good answer . He simply stayed quiet , looking at the floor . Midnight ($_midnight) sighed . 
"
14266917,2,190,"Ten , she said instead . Hizashi ($_hizashi) looked up with stars in his ($_hizashi) eyes . It s the most I can maintain him ($_hizashi) . Consider it a favor , for a long-time friend . 
"
14266917,2,191,"Thank you , Hizashi ($_hizashi) breathed out . Tears welled up in his ($_hizashi) eyes , as he ($_hizashi) handed her Izuku . 
"
14266917,2,192,"Please don t , Midnight replied with a frown . Her hands went to carry the child in her arms . It was small and warm . It broke her heart to see such a fragile creature with such a horrendous fate . This is not worth your gratitude . 
"
14266917,2,193,"And she meant it . Her heart had grown cold as stone after so many years on the field . She wouldn t go easy on Hizashi s treasured kid . This was a business after all . Bringing the little blanket to cover up his body , Midnight turned to Hizashi . 
"
14266917,2,194,"He s a healthy one , she said with care . He ll grow up strong . Strong enough to survive??????
"
14266917,2,195,"Thank god , Hizashi ($_hizashi) managed to sigh . 
"
14266917,2,196,"Midnight gave him a weak smile and stroked Izuku ($_izuku) s hair . 
"
14266917,2,197,"If you really want to thank me , she said with a soft voice , then help live long enough to raise this child . 
"
14266917,2,198,"Hizashi ($_hizashi) nodded , ever so slightly , as he ($_hizashi) got up . Aizawa ($_aizawa) walked towards him ($_hizashi) , offering his ($_hizashi) hand to help his ($_hizashi) lover get up . They both stared at Midnight , who smiled widely towards the pair of men . 
"
14266917,2,199,"His ($_hizashi) name is Izuku ($_izuku) , Aizawa ($_aizawa) answered for both of them . Hizashi ($_hizashi) was too grateful to be able to mutter something other than thank you '' . Midnight nodded . 
"
14266917,2,200,"Midnight s smile grew as she held Izuku ($_izuku) in her arms . 
"
14266917,2,201,"And Hizashi ($_hizashi) , she said , turning around to re-enter her house . Don ($_don) t go wasting you ($_don) thanks to useless gods ! 
"
14266917,2,202,"With that , they were both left on the lonely road . The promise to save the child from the future he held , unsaid but present . 
"
14266917,2,203,"So , it s done now , Aizawa ($_aizawa) said with mild awe and bigger sadness . He ($_aizawa) s a slave . 
"
14266917,2,204,"He ($_aizawa) is , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said . A fate worse than the one of a corpse . At least , unless they managed to pay for him ($_aizawa) . Trying to wave away the shock in his ($_aizawa) system , Hizashi ($_hizashi) repeated his ($_aizawa) words , he ($_aizawa) is . 
"
14266917,2,205,"And with that , they were separated from their parents . From the warmth of a mother s embrace , from the tenderness of a father s tale . They grew up to be a slave and a king , without ever being much of something else . 
"
14266917,2,206,"Katsuki was a king . Surrounded by riches and gifts . Whose father was absent and was raised by a soldier . 
"
14266917,2,207,"In turn , Izuku ($_izuku) was a slave . Surrounded by bodies that weren t his ($_izuku) own , without food to fill his ($_izuku) belly or clothes of his ($_izuku) own . Whose parents were no one , raised by a slave trader and the children around him ($_izuku) .
