13563786,5,1,"After being ordered into the castle and bolting the kitchen door , Kirishima ($_kirishima) makes his ($_kirishima) way through the castle to secure the other doors on the off chance Bakugou ($_bakugou) gets himself ($_kirishima) killed . 
"
13563786,5,2,"Cocky bastard . He ($_kirishima) s going to get himself ($_kirishima) killed and then where will we be ? 
"
13563786,5,3,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) ? 
"
13563786,5,4,"The redhead looks over at the one addressing him ($_kirishima) , not surprised to see Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
13563786,5,5,"Izuku ($_izuku) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifts nervously from foot to foot . 
"
13563786,5,6,"Is something wrong ? 
"
13563786,5,7,"A loud explosion answers the green haired young man s question , putting a concerned look on his face . 
"
13563786,5,8,"Ah , well . Some cocky knight came up to rescue you . At least I think that s what he was talking about . I didn t really get a chance to ask before Bakugou ($_bakugou) was starting the fight and telling me to secure things in here . 
"
13563786,5,9,"Wha , what . What do you mean rescue me ? I don t need rescuing . 
"
13563786,5,10,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) shrugs . I know that , you know that , pretty sure Bakugou knows that too . Unfortunately I think the creeps that knocked you out , dressed you as a girl and left you tied to a bridge to be eaten by a dragon told that knight out there something completely different about how you got here . 
"
13563786,5,11,"Izuku ($_izuku) looks horrified before frowning and making his ($_izuku) way over to the doors that lead from the great hall to the courtyard . 
"
13563786,5,12,"Wa , wait ! Izuku ($_izuku) ! I can t let you go out there ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) jumps in front of the other , blocking his ($_kirishima) path . If you got hurt out there , Bakugou ($_bakugou) would have my head . Just help me secure the doors . 
"
13563786,5,13,"But what if something happens to Bakugou , shouldn t you be out there helping him ? 
"
13563786,5,14,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) can handle himself ($_bakugou) , he ($_bakugou) s pretty good in a fight . 
"
13563786,5,15,"Then why secure the castle against one knight ? 
"
13563786,5,16,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) opens his ($_kirishima) mouth to answer , but soon closes it , not having an answer for that . 
"
13563786,5,17,"I m going out there and , Izuku ($_izuku) is cut off by another explosion , louder than the last . Bakugou ($_bakugou) ! Izuku ($_izuku) pushes Kirishima ($_kirishima) out of the way , rushing for the door . 
"
13563786,5,18,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) tries to grab him ($_kirishima) , Izuku ($_izuku) , wait ! But the other is too fast and is pulling the door open before Kirishima ($_kirishima) can make a second grab at him ($_kirishima) . 
"
13563786,5,19,"Outside , Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes widen at the once bare courtyard . Now it is littered with chunks of ice and scorch marks . His ($_kirishima) eyes search for the familiar blonde and see him ($_kirishima) down on his ($_kirishima) knees as the knight with dual colored hair strides towards him ($_kirishima) , sword drawn . 
"
13563786,5,20,"I ll avenge that_boy_you_killed ($_kirishima) . Heartless beast . 
"
13563786,5,21,"No ! Before he ($_kirishima) can even think to stop himself ($_kirishima) Izuku ($_izuku) is running toward the pair and throwing himself ($_kirishima) between them . The knight s eyes widen in surprise at someone throwing themself between the two and causing him ($_kirishima) to lower his ($_kirishima) sword a small amount . 
"
13563786,5,22,"Izuku ($_izuku) ! Get out of here you idiot , before you get yourself hurt ! 
"
13563786,5,23,"I won t let him ($_kirishima) kill you ! 
"
13563786,5,24,"Step aside , this monster doesn t deserve to be protected after what he ($_kirishima) s done . 
"
13563786,5,25,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) growls at the knight , struggling to stand , but failing as he ($_kirishima) clutches his ($_kirishima) side in pain . 
"
13563786,5,26,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) ! Izuku ($_izuku) moves to turn towards the fallen beast lord , but finds his arm being grabbed and used to yank him out of the way by the knight . 
"
13563786,5,27,"No ! Izuku ($_izuku) pulls his ($_izuku) arm free before grabbing the knight s own arm . You re wrong ! He ($_izuku) s not a monster , he ($_izuku) hasn t hurt anyone ! 
"
13563786,5,28,"The villagers down the mountain would say otherwise . With a shake of his ($_izuku) arm the knight has knocked Izuku ($_izuku) to the ground , once more making to move forward towards the growling beast lord . 
"
13563786,5,29,"They lied to you ! Izuku screams . Whatever they told you it was a lie ! I m the one they sent up here . 
"
13563786,5,30,"The knight pauses , his gaze shifting from Bakugou ($_bakugou) to look at Izuku ($_izuku) out of the corner of his eye . 
"
13563786,5,31,"You re the boy that came to spare your village ? 
"
13563786,5,32,"Is that what they told you ? 
"
13563786,5,33,"Izuku ($_izuku) ! Both turn back to the still kneeling Bakugou , his glare murderous . Go back inside. Where it 's safe ! 
"
13563786,5,34,"No ! 
"
13563786,5,35,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) growls at Izuku ($_izuku) as the green haired young man hurries over to him ($_bakugou) in an attempt to steady the beast king . 
"
13563786,5,36,"Izuku ($_izuku) looks back at the knight , defiance unwavering in his ($_izuku) green eyes . I did not come to spare that village of my own choice . They knocked me out and sent me up here to be their sacrifice . Lord_Bakugou ($_lord) has been nothing but kind to me . He ($_lord) took me in and gave me a job . And you come up here , misinformed and thinking I need saved , avenged ? 
"
13563786,5,37,"The knight has the decency to look ashamed of himself at the accusation . 
"
13563786,5,38,"I don t need rescued ! I m happy here , I finally have people that care about me . Izuku ($_izuku) looks ready to continue but is stopped by a warm pair of arms wrapping around his ($_izuku) torso and a face burying itself into his ($_izuku) back . They squeeze firmly . 
"
13563786,5,39,"Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
13563786,5,40,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) ? 
"
13563786,5,41,"The arms tighten , but no other answer is given . 
"
13563786,5,42,"Izuku ($_izuku) looks back up at the knight , his ($_izuku) sword now lowered and a lost look on his ($_izuku) face . 
"
13563786,5,43,"I m sorry . I , I had no right to charge in and attack like that . 
"
13563786,5,44,"Izuku ($_izuku) can feel Bakugou shifting to look around him ($_izuku) at the knight . You re damn right you didn t . Now leave. You re not wanted here you half n half bastard . 
"
13563786,5,45,"Izuku ($_izuku) sighs and let s his ($_izuku) shoulders slump , just glad that for now neither was going to try and continue to fight . 
"
13563786,5,46,"So , uh , is it safe to come out now ? 
"
13563786,5,47,"All three turn back to the large double set of doors leading into the castle to see Kirishima ($_kirishima) poking his ($_kirishima) head out cautiously . 
"
13563786,5,48,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) goes to lunge at the red head but stumbles and falls flat on his ($_bakugou) face after only a few steps , his ($_bakugou) injuries too much for him ($_bakugou) to get far . Before any of the others can react a squirrel runs up to the downed beast lord and pats his ($_bakugou) unruly blonde hair in sympathy . Don ($_don) t patronize me ! The squirrel is soon joined by several others and a few birds while Bakugou ($_bakugou) thrashes on the ground , not hitting a single one . 
"
13563786,5,49,"Good , he ($_bakugou) s not that hurt if he ($_bakugou) s thrashing like that . Kirishima ($_kirishima) jogs down to stand by Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
13563786,5,50,"Don ($_don) t think I forgot you ($_don) let Izuku ($_izuku) come out here Shit-for-brains . You ($_don) had one job and you ($_don) failed at it ! The woodland critters are still nudging their king and acting as if they can tend his wounds as the beast lord sits up , shooting a glare at the redhead . 
"
13563786,5,51,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) simply stares in astonishment that the brash and abrasive young dragon king is being so tolerant of such defenseless creatures . It ($_todoroki) was a dichotomy he was not prepared for , but it ($_todoroki) also explained the green haired young man s reaction . His gaze drifts over to the young man laughing and now kneeling beside the beast king . He was gently shooing the furry creatures off the angry looking blonde and looking over his wounds at the same time . 
"
13563786,5,52,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) , let me look at your ($_don) wounds . 
"
13563786,5,53,"I ll be fine ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) , you ($_don) shit , stop laughing ! This isn t funny ! And you ($_don) , Shit Prince , What are you ($_don) still doing here ? I told you ($_don) to leave , you ($_don) re not wanted here ! 
"
13563786,5,54,"Uh , well . I just , why did the villagers think they needed to send a sacrifice in the first place ? 
"
13563786,5,55,"This again ! Those fucking idiots down there just misunderstood the fucking message . 
"
13563786,5,56,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) tilts his head , hoping for an explanation . 
"
13563786,5,57,"We just wanted a maid to help keep the castle clean . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rubs the back of his ($_kirishima) head when the prince looks at him ($_kirishima) , an eyebrow raised at the explanation . 
"
13563786,5,58,"That s , you ($_don) told them you ($_don) wanted a maid ? And they thought you ($_don) wanted a maiden ? 
"
13563786,5,59,"Yeah , it was kind of confusing to be fair . He could have worded it more clearly . 
"
13563786,5,60,"Ow ! What the hell , stop poking at it . 
"
13563786,5,61,"I should get you ($_don) inside so we can clean these properly . 
"
13563786,5,62,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) steps over to the two and goes to pick Bakugou ($_bakugou) up . You ($_don) idiot , go unbolt to kitchen door , I don t want to bleed all over everything . 
"
13563786,5,63,"Eheh , right . 
"
13563786,5,64,"As Kirishima ($_kirishima) runs back inside to unbolt the kitchen door , Izuku ($_izuku) flounders , wondering if he can lift the dragon king enough to help him get to the kitchen or if he ll need to wait for Kirishima ($_kirishima) to come back . 
"
13563786,5,65,"Let me help , it 's my fault he s like this anyway . 
"
13563786,5,66,"I don t want your ($_don) help ! 
"
13563786,5,67,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) , we need to get your ($_don) wounds treated , let him help . I can t carry you ($_don) on my own . Izuku ($_izuku) s disappointed look was all it took for the glowering beast lord to give in and let Todoroki ($_todoroki) lift him onto his back . 
"
13563786,5,68,"So , it 's just the three of you ($_don) up here ? 
"
13563786,5,69,"Don ($_don) t get cozy Half n Half , you ($_don) re not staying ! 
"
13563786,5,70,"It is . Well us and Bakugou ($_bakugou) s subjects . The grin on Izuku ($_izuku) s face is full of humor and earns him a growl from the beast lord . 
"
13563786,5,71,"His subjects ? 
"
13563786,5,72,"The woodland creatures . He takes his job as Beast King very seriously . Just the other day he settled a dispute between groundhog and a rabbit over which one owned a burrow . 
"
13563786,5,73,"Shut up! That wasn t funny , that rabbit was squatting in the groundhog s burrow ! 
"
13563786,5,74,"When the kitchen door finally opens , Kirishima ($_kirishima) is met by the sight of Izuku ($_izuku) and the knight both laughing while Bakugou ($_bakugou) scowls at both of them from his ($_bakugou) place on Todoroki ($_todoroki) s back . 
"
13563786,5,75,"You both can fuck yourselves ! 
"
