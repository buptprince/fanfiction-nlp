11443656,4,14,"Oh no , what a shame ! Everyone should know about healing spells , especially the ones that can be worked into an amulet and used by someone without magic ! 
"
11443656,4,15,"Shouto ($_shouto) really does not like where this is going . Is that so. 
"
11443656,4,16,"Mhm ! Ooh , I have an idea . How about I make a healing amulet , and you use it on Bakugou ($_bakugou) ? 
"
11443656,4,17,"I don t think that s such a good idea ? 
"
11443656,4,18,"Midoriya beams at him ($_shouto) , and really , it s not right that someone so bright and cheery can then say something as calculated and uncalled for as , It s a better idea than dropping a pocketknife .

11443656,4,19,"Shouto ($_shouto) can t deny that . ... fine . 
"
11443656,4,20,"Thank you for your help ! 
"
11443656,4,21,"Their nightly stops turn into medical lectures . Shouto ($_shouto) learns an astounding amount about dragon anatomy , healing magic , how Quirks can interfere with healing magic , how Quirks can enhance healing magic , healing magic , how to imbue amulets with healing magic , healing magic , and finally , healing magic . 
"
11443656,4,22,"Oh , and how to smack Bakugou ($_bakugou) with an amulet that should instantaneously heal his ($_bakugou) wing . The sole bit of knowledge that Shouto ($_shouto) actually needs . Even though once his ($_bakugou) wing is healed they still plan to have him ($_bakugou) fly on Shinsou ($_shinsou) so he ($_bakugou) doesn t injure himself ($_bakugou) again . 
"
11443656,4,23,"You know a lot about healing magic , Shouto ($_shouto) remarks one evening , after a short tangent had turned into a thirty minute lecture . 
"
11443656,4,24,"Midoriya flushes . Shouto ($_shouto) blinks . What could be embarrassing about knowing how to heal? 
"
11443656,4,25,"Ah , well , when I was younger I got injured a lot , so I guess I figured it would be easier if I just learned to how heal myself instead of going to a medic every time !

Recovery Girl -- his ($_shinsou) doctor -- eventually refused to ... what was it ? Enable such heedless disregard for one s own health and wellbeing ? Something like that . She stopped healing him ($_shinsou) , but he ($_shinsou) didn t stop breaking bones .

"
11443656,4,35,"The making of the amulet is rather anticlimactic . Midoriya ($_midoriya) digs around in his ($_shinsou) pack and pulls out a dirty coin , then mumbles a few words over it and lets a few drops of some potion fall on it . Shouto half-expects it to flare up in a blaze , but it seems not all magic is as flashy as the Gandalf test . Instead , the potion sinks into the coin , a shimmer ripples over it , and then it s back to being a plain old coin . 
"
11443656,4,36,"There you are , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , pressing the coin into Shouto ($_shouto) s palm . Wait until he ($_midoriya) s a dragon , and then place this on him ($_midoriya) as close to the wing joint as you can . Don t worry about holding it in place or anything . As soon as it touches you should be good to go .

11443656,4,40,"Like fuck I can t ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) roars . He ($_bakugou) steps back from the fire and shifts , shaking his ($_bakugou) body like a dog shaking off water . 
"
11443656,4,41,"Oh wow , I can t believe it , Shouto ($_shouto) deadpans . He ($_bakugou) waits for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to raise a wing , then takes aim and flings the coin . It hits dead on . 
"
11443656,4,42,"Nice aim , Shinsou ($_shinsou) remarks . Did Izuku ($_izuku) tell you to throw it ? 
"
11443656,4,43,"No , but it was implied , he ($_bakugou) replies . 
"
11443656,4,44,"I didn t imply anything of the sort ! Midoriya squawks . Shouto ($_shouto) can t help but grin , ignoring Bakugou ($_bakugou) s sudden bout of explosions . 
"
11443656,4,45,"Some gratitude . 
"
11443656,4,46,"The days pass quicker and quicker , filled with Bakugou ($_bakugou) s grumbling and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s smiles and the wind on Shouto ($_shouto) s face as they fly through the wide , wide sky .

"
11443656,4,50,"Walls of the same red rock run around the edge of the island , rough and curving in slightly . Shouto ($_shouto) can only see one opening , guarded by a hovering dragon . Her scales gleam in the sunlight , black and pink and white .

"
11443656,4,69,"She and the Yuueian dragons chatter away about Aoyama s latest nonsense or how oblivious Mirio and Tamaki are , catching them up on the latest gossip . Bakugou ($_bakugou) , having never met most of these people , is fuming , sparks popping on his ($_bakugou) palms . Shouto ($_shouto) s not too bothered ; it ($_shouto) saves him ($_bakugou) having to make conversation , and lets his ($_bakugou) attention rest on the city around them . 
"
11443656,4,70,"There are no humans to be seen , the Yuueians evidently preferring their dragon forms . They fill the sky , big , small , short , long , scaled , smooth , iridescent , dull , every color imaginable 
"
11443656,4,71,"Yuuei ($_yuuei) isn t anything like the capital city of Endeavor ($_endeavor) , dim and dreary and overcrowded in his ($_yuuei) memories . There are no sharply-defined roads , only the rust-red earth and patches of green vegetation . What he ($_yuuei) had initially thought were walls around the edge of the island are caves , opening up towards the center , with dragons flying in and out . Homes , maybe . 
"
11443656,4,72,"As they go farther , there are more and more chunks of rocks floating in the air , like a giant fist smashed into the ground and the rubble was frozen in the air before it could fall back down . They vary in size , from boulders as tall as Shouto ($_shouto) to massive rocks that could match any of the buildings in Endeavor ($_endeavor) . The larger ones have been carved out , making spaces for shops and homes . Dragons fly freely , darting through the rocks with ease , a constant stream of color , rumbling voices bouncing off the rock and filling the air .

11443656,4,74,"Shouto ($_shouto) s never imagined anything like this .

11443656,4,76,"All right , here we are ! Uraraka chirps. 
"
11443656,4,77,"Council s inside , I sent a message once you ($_uraraka) arrived .

11443656,4,78,"Once we reminded you ($_uraraka) , you ($_uraraka) mean , Shinsou ($_shinsou) says with a small smile . Uraraka ($_uraraka) rolls her ($_shinsou) eyes good-naturedly .

"
11443656,4,80,"Thanks , Ochako , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , grinning . He ($_midoriya) lifts a wing to give her ($_shinsou) a quick hug , and then they walk into the spire . 
"
11443656,4,81,"The spire has been carefully hollowed out , intricate designs etched onto the walls and delicate openings providing ventilation . Just as the walls around the island have caves carved into them , the walls of the spire have chambers hollowed out . A central staircase spirals up , with thin paths branching out to connect to the walls . 
"
11443656,4,82,"The dragons , of course , don t bother with the stairs and just fly up . 
"
11443656,4,83,"They don t stop until they ve reached the very top and flown out into the open air . The top of the spire has been leveled out into an immense plateau , far above the rest of the island .

"
11443656,4,85,"Every dragon there is massive , grown large with their years . They spread over the flat red stone in a jumbled half circle . An enormous red , blue , and yellow dragon sits in the center , two golden yellow horns spiraling high from the crest of his skull .

11443656,4,95,"It was the best option at the time , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , flaring his ($_midoriya) wings the slightest bit . All will be explained in my report .

"
11443656,4,100,"My , how interesting ! the white dragon chirps . You say the curse was the work of a Quirk ?

"
11443656,4,108,"An air of tense curiosity hangs over the plateau , every dragon waiting for something more , whether dangerous or benign . You never quite knew what a spell would do on its way out . 
"
11443656,4,109,"What this spell does , apparently , is nothing , and the tension is promptly broken by the large yellow dragon standing up and declaring , Fantastic ! Now , how about a celebration for a new successful Hero ? '' 
"
11443656,4,110,"Shouto ($_shouto) spends the celebration watching Midoriya ($_midoriya) greet all his ($_midoriya) old friends and important people from under a piece of red rock .

11443656,4,147,"Shouto ($_shouto) carefully gets up from the bench . 
"
11443656,4,148,"There s nothing he ($_shouto) can use as a weapon in the cell , but if he ($_shouto) throws the blanket over the first head to poke into his ($_shouto) cell , maybe he ($_shouto) can cause a slight distraction . Why now? Why not the first night , the second night , why put him ($_shouto) in a cell at all ? 
"
11443656,4,149,"The scales stop , right outside his ($_shouto) cell . Shouto ($_shouto) crouches by the door , blanket bundled in his ($_shouto) arms . A muffled whispering , metal clinking , hinges creaking 
"
11443656,4,150,"Shouto flings the blanket and ducks under the dragon s legs . 
"
11443656,4,151,"What the - 
"
11443656,4,152,"Whoa! 
"
11443656,4,153,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) , it ($_todoroki) s us , calm down ! 
"
11443656,4,154,"Shouto doesn t bother looking back , more focused on sprinting away from the dragons . 
"
11443656,4,155,"Hitoshi , could you 
"
11443656,4,156,"On it . Todoroki ($_todoroki) . 
"
11443656,4,157,"Shouto ($_shouto) comes to a sudden stop . Why was he running , again ? 
"
11443656,4,158,"Ooh , Shinsou ($_shinsou) , you ve gotten stronger ! 
"
11443656,4,159,"Come on , you two , before he starts running again ! 
"
11443656,4,160,"Those voices sound familiar . 
"
11443656,4,161,"Shouto ($_shouto) can t help himself ($_shouto) . He turns around , and his jaw drops . 
"
11443656,4,162,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Shinsou ($_shinsou) . And , oddly enough , Uraraka ($_uraraka) instead of Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
"
11443656,4,163,"What are you doing here ? Shouto hisses , stepping back . 
"
11443656,4,164,"It s a rescue mission , of course , Midoriya ($_midoriya) whispers . We re getting you out ! 
"
11443656,4,165,"How did you 
"
11443656,4,166,"Uraraka s head jolts up . No time ! Tokoyami s coming . 
"
11443656,4,167,"Shit ! 
"
11443656,4,168,"We ll explain later , Midoriya ($_midoriya) promises , scooping up Shouto ($_shouto) and dropping him ($_midoriya) on his ($_midoriya) back . It s oddly reminiscent of their departure from his ($_midoriya) tower , if much less painful . Trust us ! 
"
11443656,4,169,"What other choice does Shouto ($_shouto) have ? 
"
11443656,4,170,"-LRB- And would he ($_midoriya) really choose any differently ? -RRB- 
"
11443656,4,171,"They make their way through the jail , corridors twisting and turning . Shouto ($_shouto) tries to keep track of their path , but he ($_shouto) loses it after they make four consecutive rights and somehow don t end up where they were before . 
"
11443656,4,172,"Before long , they re out of the prison and slinking across the floor of the central spire -LRB- and he ($_shouto) realizes that s how all the turns were possible , the floor was steadily sloping up -RRB- . They stick to the shadows , avoiding anything that looks even remotely like a dragon , until they re through the door and into open air . 
"
11443656,4,173,"Yuuei ($_yuuei) is quiet at night_,_lights_shining_from_caves_,_but_few_dragons_in_the_sky ($_,) . They make it ($_,) to the gate safely . 
"
11443656,4,174,"Shouto ($_shouto) almost swallows his ($_shouto) tongue in shock when a rough red dragon pops up out of seemingly nowhere . 
"
11443656,4,175,"You got him ($_shouto) ? he ($_shouto) asks . 
"
11443656,4,176,"We got him ($_shouto) . Thanks for covering for us , Kirishima ($_kirishima) ! Uraraka ($_uraraka) says . 
"
11443656,4,177,"Take care of Kacchan , Midoriya ($_midoriya) calls , already turning and spreading his ($_midoriya) wings . Don t let him ($_midoriya) do anything stupid . Help him ($_midoriya) become a Hero . 
"
11443656,4,178,"He ($_midoriya) ll be the manliest Hero ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) promises , grinning . Stay safe , you guys ! 
"
11443656,4,179,"You too , Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
"
11443656,4,180,"And then they ($_kirishima) re flying off into the boundless sky once again .
