15592914,1,1,"Izuku ($_izuku) had woken up early that morning and prepared breakfast for himself ($_izuku) and his ($_izuku) mother . He ($_izuku) ate by himself ($_izuku) , letting her sleep in until the sun rose . While he ($_izuku) waited , he ($_izuku) had returned to his ($_izuku) attic room to get more work done on his ($_izuku) most recent projects . 
"
15592914,1,2,"Inko_Midoriya ($_midoriya) had bought a small hat shop years before Izuku ($_izuku) was born . She ($_midoriya) and her ($_midoriya) late husband had ran the shop together , and when Izuku ($_izuku) came along they would take turns managing the shop and taking care of their son . After his ($_izuku) father disappeared without a trace , presumed dead , Izuku ($_izuku) had stepped up to take on his ($_izuku) role and try and relieve his ($_izuku) mother of the burdens of raising a child and running a shop by herself ($_midoriya) . 
"
15592914,1,3,"That was how at eighteen , Izuku_Midoriya ($_midoriya) was still working at home while all his ($_midoriya) friends had gone off on apprenticeships elsewhere . It was typical for teenagers , especially those with magical potential , to become apprentices and learn the trades they wanted to perseu . When he ($_midoriya) was younger , he ($_midoriya) d expected to learn what type of magic he ($_midoriya) had and become an apprentice as soon as he ($_midoriya) could ! That dream however , had remained just a dream for all these years . His ($_midoriya) His_childhood_bully ($_midoriya) had once told him ($_midoriya) that it wasn t his ($_midoriya) place to seek his ($_midoriya) fortune and he ($_midoriya) wouldn t amount to anything . He ($_midoriya) supposed that was right . 
"
15592914,1,4,"After all , he ($_midoriya) was an adult now and he ($_midoriya) still had no magical powers . Even his ($_midoriya) mother could levitate objects under five pounds from short distances , and his ($_midoriya) father had the ability to breathe fire . Izuku ($_izuku) inherited neither . On top of that , he ($_izuku) was plain looking and he ($_izuku) spent most of his ($_izuku) time running the shop for his ($_izuku) mother , so he ($_izuku) hadn t many friends . 
"
15592914,1,5,"His ($_izuku) His_best_friend_Uraraka ($_other) Uraraka ($_uraraka) had discovered her ($_other) levitation magic when they ($_other) were both eight years old . She ($_other) used to help out at the hat shop when they ($_other) were kids , but this past year she ($_other) had taken an apprenticeship with the Wizard Thirteen . His_only_other_friend_Iida ($_other) His ($_izuku) only other friend Iida was in training with his ($_izuku) brother to become a soldier . The_Iidas ($_the) had always been loyal guards to the royal family and with the growing hostilities their ($_the) kingdom had , they ($_the) needed every guard they ($_the) could get . 
"
15592914,1,6,"Izuku ($_izuku) sighed . It was lonely here without them ($_the) . Sure , he ($_izuku) did enjoy making hats and he ($_izuku) loved his ($_izuku) mother more than anything but that didn t mean he ($_izuku) didn t spend the the past year throwing himself ($_izuku) at hat making completely to give him ($_izuku) something to focus on other than the emptiness . He ($_izuku) d come to accept lately , that he ($_izuku) would spend his ($_izuku) life magicless and alone . He ($_izuku) would never become like his ($_izuku) idol , All Might , the most powerful Wizard there was . 
"
15592914,1,7,"He ($_izuku) methodically sewed wax flowers and berries into the ribbon on a wide brimmed sun hat . He ($_izuku) tried to picture what kind of person might buy the hat , as he ($_izuku) did with each one he ($_izuku) made . 
"
15592914,1,8,"You re not flashy , but you re still pretty , he ($_izuku) said to the hat . He ($_izuku) had a habit of talking to them and muttering , even when he ($_izuku) didn t realize it . Some young lady will treasure you and wear you every sunny day for years to come . You ll help her catch the eye of someone very special . 
"
15592914,1,9,"His ($_izuku) reassurance was to the hats , not himself ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) liked to think of the hats felt good about themselves then people would feel good wearing them . This theory hadn t failed him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) had started as a child , and since people did feel good wearing his ($_izuku) hats there was no real reason to stop now . 
"
15592914,1,10,"He ($_izuku) picked up his ($_izuku) newly finished hat and headed downstairs to wake up his ($_izuku) mother . The sun was starting to rise now . The pale light of the sunrise peaked into the house through unshielded windows . He ($_izuku) put down the hat outside her room , and went in . 
"
15592914,1,11,"Mom ? It s morning . I made tea and I cooked eggs on toast . Your food is waiting in the kitchen when you re ready . 
"
15592914,1,12,"She grumbled and woke up , rubbing sleep from her eyes . 
"
15592914,1,13,"Is it that time of day already ? Gosh . She let out a yawn . 
"
15592914,1,14,"We re running a bit low on bread and milk , Izuku ($_izuku) mentioned . So I was going to head to the market and pick some up . Do you need anything while I m out ? 
"
15592914,1,15,"Hmm could you get some cheese and jam as well ? I was thinking we could take tomorrow off and have a picnic ! You ve been working so hard , and you deserve a break sometimes Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
15592914,1,16,"Mom , I m not so sure taking a break is he best idea . We re barely scraping by as it is , I don t mind working longer hours . 
"
15592914,1,17,"It was true . The hat shop didn t make a ton of money , but it was what his mother loved doing and they were in no position to sell it . Where would they live ? What would they do to make money ? It was hats or nothing . If he had to work long hours to make sure him and his mother could afford food , water , and other necessities , he wasn t bothered . 
"
15592914,1,18,"Izuku ($_izuku) , I am your mother and the owner of this store . As your boss , I say tomorrow we both need to rest up . Besides , you ve been working so hard on making hats lately , I barely see you and would like to catch up ! Have you heard from your friends on their apprenticeships ? Any juicy gossip ? And boys or girls you re interested in ? 
"
15592914,1,19,"M-mom ! Izuku ($_izuku) protested . She giggled at his ($_izuku) embarrassment . 
"
15592914,1,20,"A mother likes to take time and chat every now and then ! I miss talking to my little boy . 
"
15592914,1,21,"Were he ($_izuku) any closer to her , she would have lovingly pinched his ($_izuku) cheek or mussed up his ($_izuku) hair . She meant well , but as a parent it was her job to embarrass her son from time to time . 
"
15592914,1,22,"I-I ll head to the market now . I guess picnic preparations are in order . Bye ! He said it all very quickly and excused himself so he wouldn t have to acknowledge his mothers questions or risk more teasing . Plus , he didn t have anything in the ways of a love life so all he could have shared were the details from Uraraka ($_uraraka) and Iida s letters . 
"
15592914,1,23,"
"
15592914,1,24,"The trip to the market was a bit far into town , but Izuku ($_izuku) didn t mind . He liked walking around admiring everything there was to see along the way . He had dressed in a grey button up shirt , black dress pants , and red shoes with his usual tan hat with a green ribbon tied around it . 
"
15592914,1,25,"He admired his handiwork on the headgear in a passing window . The green ribbon was tied in a small bow , with the two string ends sticking up into the air dynamically . They reminded him of All Might s hair that stuck up similarly . The outfit was a bit plain , but he d been told his whole life that he was a plain person and he d come to accept that . 
"
15592914,1,26,"The market was crowded by the time he got there , but he got the required items and was heading back when he felt a hand grab his arm . 
"
15592914,1,27,"Startled , he yelled and nearly jumped a foot into the air . He looked at his assailant only to find his childhood friend Bakugo standing there looking particularly upset . 
"
15592914,1,28,"Ka - Kachan ! You re back from your apprenticeship ? So soon? Um, congrats-???
"
15592914,1,29,"I didn t complete it you idiot , the other boy said with a tone of malice and impatience . The guy I was working under only took me in because he wanted to teach me fucking manners , so I quit . I ll find a new teacher who won t hold me back this time . 
"
15592914,1,30,"Oh , y-yes that makes sense . I was wondering how you had completed an apprenticeship so quickly and why you would come back here if you had since you d be a certified magician and - 
"
15592914,1,31,"You re rambling dumbass . 
"
15592914,1,32,"R-right . Did you um need something from me ? 
"
15592914,1,33,"You re the first person I ve seen since I got back and I figured you could fill me in on any wizards taking in new apprentices . You still stalk all the famous wizards , right loser ? 
"
15592914,1,34,"It was true . The part about him keeping tabs on wizards , not the part about him being a loser . He supposed whether he was a loser or not was subjective . Still , when he wasn t working at the hat shop he was taking notes on all the stories and rumors he heard about the famous wizards . He had all but given up on ever having magic , but he had been analyzing magic users for as long as he remembered and he found it calming to study their strategies and ways of life . 
"
15592914,1,35,"Still ... he didn t have time for this . He had to get home and work at the shop more if he was taking tomorrow off . 
"
15592914,1,36,"I really don t have time for this Kachan . I need to get going , s-sorry ! 
"
15592914,1,37,"I wasn t asking dumbass , I was telling ! His estranged childhood friend readied a fist like he was about to summon an explosion , which caused Izuku ($_izuku) to instinctively flinch . They were a few streets away from the market , and no one else seemed to be around to notice or care about the threat . 
"
15592914,1,38,"I haven t even heard anything that interesting ! Since All Might went missing most of the other wizards are just picking up his slack . Then that mysterious castle showed up on the hill , but I don t know much about it other than it belongs to the Wizard Todoroki , and he s said to eat the hearts of pretty people but I don t know if that s entirely accurate because - 
"
15592914,1,39,"Bakugo ($_bakugo) interrupted with an explosion next to his ($_bakugo) head . 
"
15592914,1,40,"You ($_deku) re just spouting useless rumors , I told you ($_deku) to tell me something useful , Deku ($_deku) ! 
"
15592914,1,41,"Izuku ($_izuku) started to panic . He ($_izuku) really didn t know anything useful , and he ($_izuku) hadn t anticipated having to face Bakugo ($_bakugo) again so soon after he ($_izuku) d left for his ($_izuku) apprenticeship with the Fabric Wizard , Best Jeanist . His ($_izuku) ear was ringing from the explosion by his ($_izuku) head and Bakugo ($_bakugo) reached out to grab him ($_izuku) by the front of shirt , when Izuku ($_izuku) felt himself ($_izuku) being gently lifted to the side briskly . 
"
15592914,1,42,"There you ($_deku) are , I 've been looking everywhere for you ($_deku) , said a calm deep voice attached to the arm that had wrapped itself around his ($_izuku) waist . 
"
15592914,1,43,"Izuku ($_izuku) looked up to see a taller man dressed in a white tunic with a blue and silver embroidered jacket hanging off his ($_izuku) shoulders . His ($_izuku) hair was a silvery white on one side of his ($_izuku) head , and split down the center it was red along the other side . His ($_izuku) facial features were soft and elegant , with eyes of two different colors and nearly flawless skin . The only thing keeping it from being completely flawless was a massive burn scar that stretched from his ($_izuku) left eye to his ($_izuku) hairline . 
"
15592914,1,44,"He ($_izuku) looked calm , and had swept Izuku ($_izuku) out of the way before Bakugo ($_bakugo) could grab him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) also seemed to be ignoring the angry blonde wizard in training , who didn t take kindly to not being acknowledged . The_stranger ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) head to Izuku in an angle that Bakugo ($_bakugo) couldn t see his ($_izuku) face and gave him ($_izuku) a wink . 
"
15592914,1,45,"Oh , r-right ! Izuku ($_izuku) blurted out awkwardly . He ($_izuku) stiffened up at the touch , and was grateful to be rescued from his ($_izuku) childhood bully , but unsure yet if this was any better yet . 
"
15592914,1,46,"We really should be getting back , he ($_izuku) said guiding Izuku ($_izuku) forwards with the hand around his ($_izuku) hip . He ($_izuku) walked him ($_izuku) away from Bakugo ($_bakugo) and towards the end of the street . 
"
15592914,1,47,"Hey! Don ($_don) t you ($_don) ignore me you ($_don) half and half freak ! 
"
15592914,1,48,"The half and half bastard in question proceeded to dismiss the comment and walked Izuku ($_izuku) around the nearest corner . 
"
15592914,1,49,"He ($_izuku) s going to keep following isn t he ($_izuku) ? The_mysterious_man ($_izuku) said without a fluctuation in his ($_izuku) tone of voice . It was phrased like a question , but said as a statement . 
"
15592914,1,50,"Yea , Izuku replied worriedly . 
"
15592914,1,51,"Take my hand , and get ready to run , he ($_izuku) warned . He ($_izuku) wore an intense look on his ($_izuku) face , and he ($_izuku) pitched forward with Izuku ($_izuku) s hand in his ($_izuku) own . 
"
15592914,1,52,"They rounded the next corner , making sure to be out of sight from the_angry_man_who_pursued_them ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) assumed that running was the only plan , and didn t even notice when his ($_izuku) steps started to lift off the ground . The_stranger ($_izuku) s hand that wasn t holding his ($_izuku) own reached around him ($_izuku) to hold him ($_izuku) steady as they started to walk higher and higher into the air . Izuku ($_izuku) let out a surprised gasp , and stared at the ground that was getting farther and farther away from him ($_izuku) . 
"
15592914,1,53,"I wouldn t look down if I were you ($_deku) , he ($_izuku) was warned . 
"
15592914,1,54,"Izuku ($_izuku) was so shocked by the turn of events . He ($_izuku) nearly dropped the basket with the bread , cheese , milk , and jam as they floated along . He ($_izuku) looked to his ($_izuku) side at the_strange_man ($_izuku) , trying to read his ($_izuku) face . He ($_izuku) looked stoic , but there was the tiniest hint of a smile on his ($_izuku) lips . His ($_izuku) eyes showed a determination and satisfaction that Izuku ($_izuku) was almost intimidated by . He ($_izuku) knew that being carried through the air by a stranger should be terrifying , but Izuku ($_izuku) was never good at being scared in situations like this . Instead he ($_izuku) was ... curious . 
"
15592914,1,55,"Who are you ($_deku) ? he ($_izuku) asked . I mean if you ($_deku) re making us float you ($_deku) must be some sort of Wizard but I don t remember hearing of any local levitation wizards around town aside from Uraraka and my mother you ($_deku) are certainly neither . Though maybe you ($_deku) don t only specialize in levitation ? Maybe you ($_deku) don t have a specification or maybe you ($_deku) re working on multiple fields of magical studies or - 
"
15592914,1,56,"You ($_deku) re overthinking it . I m nobody of consequence really . 
"
15592914,1,57,"Izuku ($_izuku) didn t believe that for a second . In all the panic and intrigue he ($_izuku) hadn t thought to pay attention to where they were going until he ($_izuku) saw they were approaching the balcony of the hat shop . 
"
15592914,1,58,"So if you ($_deku) re not one of the local wizards I m familiar with then you ($_deku) must be new in town , right ? Are you ($_deku) doing an apprenticeship ? You ($_deku) don t look much older than myself ($_deku) so i ca n't image you ($_deku) re a_fully_trained_wizard_yet ($_the) , but you ($_deku) do seem very powerful for a Wizard in training . 
"
15592914,1,59,"That s very presumptuous , don t you ($_deku) think ? 
"
15592914,1,60,"The_mystery_wizard ($_the) perched on the railing on of the buildings balcony , as he ($_the) gently lowered Izuku ($_izuku) all the way down to the wooden planks that made up the structure . Izuku ($_izuku) suddenly felt his ($_izuku) full weight return to him ($_izuku) as a soft hand retracted from his ($_izuku) own . 
"
15592914,1,61,"It was lovely to meet you ($_deku) , Deku ($_deku) . Try not to get into anymore trouble , the_Wizard ($_the) teased . He ($_the) started to step away , but Izuku ($_izuku) caught his ($_the) hand before he ($_the) could . 
"
15592914,1,62,"Wait! 
"
15592914,1,63,"The_wizard ($_the) looked surprised at the attention . His ($_the) eyes widened , but then thinned again into an look that was equal parts inquisitive and intrigued . 
"
15592914,1,64,"Yes? 
"
15592914,1,65,"If you ($_deku) re going to leave at least tell me your ($_deku) name ! I try to learn about every wizard that I meet , but I haven t heard of you ($_deku) before and I d like to make an entry in my journal but I can t just put dual hair colored mystery wizard . Well I could but it would be awkward and not entirely accurate . Plus - 
"
15592914,1,66,"The_wizard ($_the) smirked a little at that , and he ($_the) knelt down to kiss the hand that was holding his ($_the) own . The_man ($_the) s lips were soft as they graced Izuku ($_izuku) s skin , and the contact made his ($_the) breath hitch slightly . In his ($_the) surprise at the gesture , Izuku ($_izuku) let his ($_the) grip on the hand loosen and the_wizard ($_the) took a step back into thin air . He ($_the) started to leave but he ($_the) looked back before he ($_the) departed . 
"
15592914,1,67,"My name is Shouto , he ($_the) replied . 
"
15592914,1,68,"Shouto_Izuku ($_shouto) echoed . 
"
15592914,1,69,"And just like that he ($_the) was off . He ($_the) walked across thin air and out of sight . Izuku ($_izuku) let out a breath he ($_the) hadn t realized he ($_the) d been holding in , and turned to walk into the shop when the balcony door opened and his ($_the) mother burst through . 
"
15592914,1,70,"Izuku ($_izuku) ! She had tears running down her eyes as she tackled him ($_the) into a hug and dawned over him ($_the) . 
"
15592914,1,71,"Mom ! Hi! 
"
15592914,1,72,"You had me so worried when you took so long getting food . I always worry when you don t return soon . It remind me of the night that night when your father Her voice trailed off , and her tears continued . 
"
15592914,1,73,"I m safe , don t worry ! He hugged her tightly . I ran into Kachan ($_kachan) and he wanted to catch up , when this_wizard ($_the) saw me and took me home safely . 
"
15592914,1,74,"I saw ! You were flying ! I m glad you re back home in one piece honey but you need to be more careful ! What if that had been the Wizard Todoroki ? He would have eaten your heart and I d have never gotten you back ! She wailed . 
"
15592914,1,75,"Don t be silly mom , Todoroki only eats the hearts of beautiful people . Besides , he told me his name was Shouto ($_shouto) . 
"
15592914,1,76,"He said the last part to convince her , but he noticed as he said so that Shouto ($_shouto) had only given him a first name . He was also definitely hiding a lot . Maybe he would see him around town again soon and he could find out more ? He certainly hoped so . Plus , then he could tell the_wizard ($_the) that his name wasn t Deku , and that was just a mean childhood nickname . 
"
15592914,1,77,"It wasn t that Izuku ($_izuku) wanted to see Shouto ($_shouto) because had been handsome or that he saved him , it ($_shouto) was definitely only because he was mysterious and Izuku ($_izuku) wanted to answer those questions in his notebooks . It was purely scientific curiosity and had nothing to do with how he felt looking at the_wizard ($_the) s soft lips or his beautiful blue and grey eyes . It was nothing to do with the kiss on his hand at all . 
"
15592914,1,78,"He went back to working the shop and daydreaming about seeing Shouto ($_shouto) again . Only his hopes wouldn t be fulfilled . At least , not the way he dreamed they would be . 
"
15592914,1,79,"
"
15592914,1,80,"That night , Izuku ($_izuku) was closing up the shop . He ($_izuku) had sold a few good pieces that afternoon and he ($_izuku) was sure the smile on his ($_izuku) face from the days earlier interaction helped with his ($_izuku) already decent customer service . 
"
15592914,1,81,"In his ($_izuku) recently dull life , today had been exciting ! He ($_izuku) hoped he ($_izuku) got to see more of the_new_wizard ($_the) , and he ($_izuku) looked forward to tomorrow s picnic with his ($_izuku) mother . Hopefully he ($_izuku) wouldn t run into Kachan ($_kachan) again so he ($_izuku) could go about life normally for a while . Plus he ($_izuku) was sure the_angry_blonde_man ($_izuku) would have a million questions about Shouto ($_shouto) and Izuku ($_izuku) didn t want to answer any of those . 
"
15592914,1,82,"The smile on his ($_izuku) face faded as he ($_izuku) heard the door to the shop open . He ($_izuku) sighed . Some people had no respect for closing hours . He ($_izuku) really needed to start locking the door before closing shop , not after . 
"
15592914,1,83,"I m sorry , were closed , he ($_izuku) said without looking to see who it was . 
"
15592914,1,84,"You are a fool to think I would come here for one of your tacky hats , said an intimidating voice . 
"
15592914,1,85,"Izuku ($_izuku) looked up to see a tall muscular man dressed sharply and looking down at him ($_izuku) with extreme distaste . 
"
15592914,1,86,"C-can I help you ? Izuku ($_izuku) was starting to be afraid . No , this was past afraid . Every instinct told him ($_izuku) to run , and he ($_izuku) felt a powerful energy coming from this man . Was that the man s magic ? 
"
15592914,1,87,"Run . Run to the door that leads upstairs and lock it behind you . Barricade it with anything you can find and hope he ($_izuku) goes away . 
"
15592914,1,88,"It was a naive thought , and even if he ($_izuku) could have made it to the door he ($_izuku) doubted it would do much good against magic . Instead he ($_izuku) stayed stationary at the register of the shop , trying not to appear phased by the death stare he ($_izuku) was being given . 
"
15592914,1,89,"You can tell me , where has Shouto ($_shouto) gone ? That_fickle_boy ($_izuku) was here earlier . I can sense his ($_izuku) use of magic all around you . There is no use in hiding it . 
"
15592914,1,90,"The_intimidating_man_glared_at_Izuku ($_izuku) Izuku ($_izuku) s hand that Shouto ($_shouto) had kissed earlier . Izuku ($_izuku) pulled the hand behind his ($_izuku) back quickly . He ($_izuku) d assumed the magic the man sensed was the levitation magic from earlier , but that look suggested otherwise . What exactly was that kiss ? 
"
15592914,1,91,"Shouto ($_shouto) ? Izuku ($_izuku) shifted on his ($_izuku) feet . How exactly do you know him ($_izuku) ? 
"
15592914,1,92,"The muscular man was clearly getting impatient . He took a deep breath before his face lit up with flames around his beard and mustache , and the same fire spread to his shoulders and hands . His face was a portrait of wrath .

15592914,1,93,"This is your last chance to tell me what I need to know or suffer the consequences , boy . 
"
15592914,1,94,"Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes widened . He ($_izuku) should have recognized the man standing before him ($_izuku) from his ($_izuku) own notes , but he ($_izuku) had never seen the man in person and he ($_izuku) had never seen a drawing of him ($_izuku) without his ($_izuku) fire surrounding him ($_izuku) . Standing here in the shop was the number two most powerful magic user in the land , the Wizard of the Wastes Endeavor . 
"
15592914,1,95,"No , you can t be here ! All Might set up protections around the city , they should have stopped you - 
"
15592914,1,96,"All_Might ($_all) is gone . I saw too it ($_all) personally . Without him ($_izuku) here , his ($_izuku) magic can not protect you , the man stated as he ($_izuku) lifted up his ($_izuku) hand . And you can not protect my_Shouto ($_my) . The_boy ($_izuku) s foolish rebellion has gone on long enough . I will not suffer the likes of you prolonging it ($_my) . What is my son thinking hanging around weak creatures like yourself . 
"
15592914,1,97,"Son ($_son) . He said son ($_son) . Izuku ($_izuku) started to put the pieces together , but all too late . Endeavor s raises hand let out a powerful blast of magic , a curse , right at Izuku ($_izuku) and there was no avoiding it . 
"
15592914,1,98,"He clutched at the countertop and cried out in pain as the curse took hold . His grip loosened and he fell to the floor , feeling weak and frail all of a sudden . He curled up in a fetal position , expecting the worst . He clutched at his chest and gasped for air , but the feeling stopped just as suddenly as the curse had begun . 
"
15592914,1,99,"He picked himself up as best he could , but his joints all ached horribly and he felt as if he was drained of a his upper body strength . He looked up to see Endeavor smiling down at him . 
"
15592914,1,100,"That should teach you not to keep information from me . Let this be a lesson in respecting your elders , boy , he said as he walked towards the exit . He paused as he opened the door . The best part is , you won t even be able to tell anyone about this . Especially not my_Shouto ($_my) . 
"
15592914,1,101,"And with that he was gone . Izuku ($_izuku) mustered all his strength to lift himself up off the floor . He didn t feel injured , just weak and tired . Still , something was different . 
"
15592914,1,102,"He hobbled over to the nearest mirror to examine the damage , and was shocked at what he saw . He covered his mouth to stifle a scream of shock and horror .
