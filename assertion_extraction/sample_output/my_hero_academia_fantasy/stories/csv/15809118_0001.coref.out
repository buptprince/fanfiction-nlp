15809118,1,1,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned . He ($_midoriya) had been travelling with his ($_midoriya) friend , the Zero-Gravity Witch , Uraraka ($_uraraka) , but they had gotten separated during a battle , and now he ($_midoriya) was wandering around in an unfamiliar forest . Alone , with only his ($_midoriya) sword and martial arts skills to defend himself ($_midoriya) . 
"
15809118,1,2,"I hope that Uraraka ($_uraraka) is alright ... he ($_uraraka) thought . Wait, what is that...? He ($_uraraka) felt a huge amount of power emanating from a certain direction . He ($_uraraka) began to walk in the direction of the aura , and eventually came to a clearing . Somebody wearing a darkly coloured clock was standing in the middle . 
"
15809118,1,3,"""Hello?"" Midoriya ($_midoriya) called out . The figure turned . They had oddly coloured dark blue hair , tied in to a loose ponytail that hung over their shoulder . Their face was covered with bandages , so with blood on them , fresh or a bit old . Despite the long robe he ($_uraraka) -LRB- Midoriya ($_midoriya) figured it was a he ($_uraraka) -RRB- had bruises and cuts peppering his ($_uraraka) arms . He ($_uraraka) had a gold bracelet on his ($_uraraka) right arm and an anklet on his ($_uraraka) left leg , both of which had jewels -LRB- emitted faint auras -RRB- embedded in them . There were a several small bags slung over their shoulder as well as a scabbard on his ($_uraraka) back . 
"
15809118,1,4,"`` Ah . I did n't sense your presence . You must be very talented to conceal your magic so well . '' 
"
15809118,1,5,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled . `` Haha ... I 'm not . I. . . do n't have magic , a quirk . '' The stranger frowned and looked away , as if in thought . `` That 's quite rare . Did I offend ? I did n't even consider that possibility ... '' They sighed . `` Huh ($_huh) ? Oh , that must she 's here . '' 
"
15809118,1,6,"`` Oh there you are ! Do n't just run off in the early morning before I 'm even awake . You know it 's dangerous . '' A_girl_with_black_hair_with_a_spiky_ponytail ($_yaoyorozu) walked into the clearing . She ($_yaoyorozu) looked like she ($_yaoyorozu) was the daughter of a noble or something . 
"
15809118,1,7,"`` Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) , I 'm not helpless , even if I ca n't see anymore . Are you really underestimating me ? '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) ? That was an Endeavoran noble family . No wonder she ($_yaoyorozu) seemed familiar . Who does n't know the Yaoyorozus ? The only other more well known Endeavoran family would be the royal family themselves , the Todorokis . `` Of course not-hmm ? Who is that? I 'll assume their not an enemy , or you would have probably stabbed them already . '' `` Now you 're making me seem like a murderer or something . One extreme or another , it should seem . '' 
"
15809118,1,8,"`` Oh , I guess I 'll introduce myself then . I 'm Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Midoriya_Izuku_,_from_Yuuei_,_though_despite_that_,_I_do_n't_reconize_these_Yuuein_woods ($_,) , so do n't ask me for directions . I 'm travelling with a friend , who I got seperated from , and while looking for her ($_,) I ended up here . We 're going to the Dragon Kingdom . Your turn . '' 
"
15809118,1,9,"`` I 'm Sh ... Shiro ($_shiro) . That 's it . '' Huh ($_huh) , he ($_huh) wo n't share much . Does this mean something ? `` I ($_huh) 'm Yaoyorozu Momo , travelling with Shiro ($_shiro) , and at his ($_shiro) request , we 're going to any kingdom that 's not the one we came from . Coincedentally , that 's the_Dragon_Kingdom ($_the) . '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) raised his ($_midoriya) eyebrows . `` Then we can travel together . '' `` The more the merrier , right ? '' Uraraka ($_uraraka) walked into the clearing . Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) quickly created a sword . Oh? That must be what her ($_yaoyorozu) quirk is . Interesting and powerful , can be used in many situations and - `` Aww , thank you ! I could hear you muttering about it . I 'm not special besides that , though ... '' she ($_yaoyorozu) trailed off . 
"
15809118,1,10,"`` Did I surprise you ? Sorry , I 'm Uraraka Ochako , travelling with Deku ($_deku) . '' `` Deku ($_deku) ? '' Shiro ($_shiro) asked . `` That 's her ($_yaoyorozu) nickname for me ($_shiro) . Someone I ($_shiro) knew when I ($_shiro) was younger called me ($_shiro) that before too . '' Shiro ($_shiro) nodded . '' That makes sense . '' ""Let's go then! We 're on a deadline , after all . '' exclaimed Midoriya ($_midoriya) . `` Deadline ? For what?"" Midoriya ($_midoriya) mentally hit himself ($_midoriya) . I 'd have to explain later anyway , but who said I have to give every detail ? Perhaps , since Endeavor and Yuuei ($_yuuei) are n't on the best terms , I 'll leave out a bit of information . 
"
15809118,1,11,"`` Well , you see , Yuuei ($_yuuei) and the_Dragon_Kingdom ($_the) have a combined festival that 's coming up , to celebrate mark the peace between the kingdoms . Their sort of in a half-alliance , more like a truce really . It 's an agreement between the kingdoms so there are n't wars between them . It 's beneficial to both kingdoms , and if they were to have a war , it 's agreed that for all the years those two kingdoms are at war with each other , the festival would n't happen . It 's tradition that the festival is held on the border , but during that time Uraraka and I also take some time to visit the king , so ... Also , a bit after this festival , the_Dragon_Kingdom ($_the) has a festival with Crimson to celebrate the combining of their kingdoms . '' 
"
15809118,1,12,"`` Ah , I never knew that . For all my reading and studying , I never could find much about the other kingdoms . '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) sighed . Shiro ($_shiro) nodded . `` True , all the books in my ($_shiro) library scarce mentioned the cultures and festivals of the other kingdoms . Must be because the king does n't like any kingdom but his own ... '' 
"
15809118,1,13,"`` Anyway , we really should get going . The All Might 's probably already there . He likes to arrive a week or two early_,_right_Deku ($_deku) ? '' Damn it . Just do n't act up , Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Hope they pay it no mind . ""Right. We 're already slightly behind schedule , so it 'd be bad to become even later - '' `` You are acquainted with the king of Yuuei , All Might ? '' Shiro ($_shiro) asked suddenly . `` Huh ($_huh) ? Yeah , we are . Guess it 's unusual , huh , quirkless little me ($_shiro) knowing the king of Yuuei ($_yuuei) ? Who would 've even imagined that ... '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) chuckled mirthlessly . `` That 's not what I ($_shiro) was implying - oh , what have I ($_shiro) gotten myself ($_shiro) into ... ? Acquaintences of the king of Yuuei ($_yuuei) ... '' Shiro ($_shiro) seemed to be in thinking about something once again . Uh-oh , I ($_shiro) hope that these guys are n't like , Endeavoran spies or something . That would be bad . What have I ($_shiro) gotten myself ($_shiro) into ? 
"
15809118,1,14,"`` I ($_shiro) believe earlier you stated you did n't know these woods . How then , would you know which direction to go in ? '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) asked . Damn , I ($_shiro) never thought of that . `` I ($_shiro) could try using my ($_shiro) quirk to send someone into the air and scout around a bit , not bothered by the trees ? '' Uraraka ($_uraraka) suggested . ""Oh, alright then."" `` Deku ($_deku) , are you alright with being the scout ? '' Uraraka ($_uraraka) asked . No problem . ""Sure."" She ($_uraraka) tapped his shoulder , and lifted him into the air with her ($_uraraka) magic . 
"
15809118,1,15,"`` You ($_uraraka) 're a air elementalist ? I know someone that 's a wind elementalist . '' Uraraka ($_uraraka) looked surprised . `` You ($_uraraka) actually got that right , Shiro_,_I ($_shiro) 'm impressed ! A lot of people confuse my quirk as a wind controlling one , but it 's really more like levitation , which falls under the category of air . I wonder why they do n't just combine the categories for wind and air magic to make it less confusing . '' `` Alright , I 've figured out which direction to go in ! You can put me down now , Uraraka ($_uraraka) ! '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) called out from above them . ""Okay!"" 
"
15809118,1,16,"Once back on the ground , Midoriya ($_midoriya) pointed in the west . `` That 's where we have to go to get to the Dragon Kingdom . '' `` Now that we know what direction to go in , let 's get going ! '' 
"
15809118,1,17,"Soon , evening came . They had arrived at a river . `` It 's getting dark now . Let 's stop for today . '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) decided . `` We should start a campfire , before monsters come here . It 'll give us light and warmth , at least . '' suggested Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Shiro ($_shiro) frowned . `` It wo n't ward them off , unless it 's a magical fire . '' Uraraka ($_uraraka) sighed . `` We do n't really want any monsters coming , but we also have no way of making a magical fire . '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) looked at Shiro ($_shiro) apologetically . He ($_yaoyorozu) shook his ($_yaoyorozu) head in response . `` No , I have ... some materials in one of these bags that can . '' `` I 'll go see what I can hunt . '' Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) put hew bag on the ground and left . 
"
15809118,1,18,"Shiro ($_shiro) collected a several dried branches and leaves , knelt on the ground , and made a pile . . He ($_yaoyorozu) took one of the small bags and took some powder out and put in on the pile . Then he ($_yaoyorozu) started rubbing the sticks together like a normal fire . A spark appeared , but soon fizzled out . `` Damn it . '' he ($_yaoyorozu) muttered . Then , there was a faint glow , and the pile soon became a nice campfire . ""Ah, there must have been more sparks underneath what was visible."" Shiro ($_shiro) then got up . `` Monsters wo n't bother us now . Mostly. The most dangerous kinds will ignore magical fires if the fires are n't strong enough , but they rarely ever show up in this area . '' He ($_yaoyorozu) picked up the_bag_Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) had put on the ground and took out a few cups and a pot . Then , he ($_yaoyorozu) took some dried leaves out of one of his ($_yaoyorozu) bags , collected some water in the pot , put the leaves in , and hung the pot over the fire . 
"
15809118,1,19,"`` That will make some tea that when drunk , will help you restore magic quicker -LRB- as when used , it consumes energy -RRB- during sleep . '' Later , Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) returned . They cooked what she ($_yaoyorozu) caught , and when they finished eating , Uraraka ($_uraraka) asked , `` Hey , did you hear about how the king of Endeavor is really angry because the prince has disappeared . '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) nodded . `` Is n't he ($_midoriya) blaming All Might , or at least Yuuei ($_yuuei) ? '' Yaoyorozu and Shiro ($_shiro) stiffened . Oh? ""What's wrong?"" asked Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) exhaled . `` Nothing . It 's just ... it 's never good when he 's angry . '' `` I 'd heard that he has quite a temper . So it 's true ? '' asked Uraraka ($_uraraka) . `` That 's putting mildly , but yeah . '' muttered Shiro ($_shiro) . `` Anyways , I 'm going to sleep . ''
