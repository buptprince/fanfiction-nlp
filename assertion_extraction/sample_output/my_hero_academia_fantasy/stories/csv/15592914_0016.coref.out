15592914,16,1,"The shop was just as Izuku ($_izuku) remembered it being that day they had visited his ($_izuku) mother . The hats were all gone , not even a piece of ribbon or a silk flower was left behind . The only things that had been left behind by the move were dust and spiders , which Shouto ($_shouto) enjoyed but Izuku ($_izuku) rather wished he ($_izuku) could evict . 
"
15592914,16,2,"The day before , Shouto ($_shouto) had shown him ($_izuku) around the castle . He ($_shouto) could barely sleep that night he ($_shouto) was too excited to get the shop started . He ($_shouto) had woken up early that morning so he ($_shouto) could get to work . He ($_shouto) d originally planned to check in with his ($_shouto) mother that day , but he ($_shouto) realized that it would be better to check in with her after the shop was in business . They d have more to talk about that way . 
"
15592914,16,3,"He ($_shouto) got one of the fresh notebooks that Shouto ($_shouto) had made him ($_shouto) and headed to the field of flowers to take notes , muttering continually as he ($_shouto) went along . He ($_shouto) took note of what flower combinations might be pretty , and then he ($_shouto) went back into the library to get a book on flower symbolism . He ($_shouto) figured no one would really care about the meaning of the bouquets so much as they would care about the look , but he ($_shouto) was never one to do things in half measures . If he ($_shouto) was going to make bouquets he ($_shouto) would make the nicest , most meaningful bouquets that Market Chipping had ever seen . 
"
15592914,16,4,"He ($_shouto) wrote down the meanings of flowers in his ($_shouto) notebook next to the illustrations he ($_shouto) d drawn of each plant . Each page listed the name , meaning , and color variations of the flower , with a drawing to the side . Further room for notes and different flower combinations beside it . Some pages he ($_shouto) even had pressed blossoms or leaves that he ($_shouto) stuck to them . 
"
15592914,16,5,"At the moment he ($_shouto) was filling out the chapter on roses . They seemed to be what would sell the best , since everyone knew what they were and thought they were so romantic . Each color meant something different . He ($_shouto) was sure the traditional red declaration of true love would be the most popular , but he ($_shouto) quite enjoyed the other colors as well . Yellows were pretty , but their meaning varied from warm friendship to jealousy and betrayal , so he ($_shouto) figured he ($_shouto) would avoid those . He ($_shouto) noticed some variegated roses in the garden that he ($_shouto) thought were the most beautiful of them all . The ones that Shouto ($_shouto) had grown were red with orange stripes , but Izuku ($_izuku) wondered if he ($_shouto) could get some to grow in red and white like the_wizard ($_shouto) s hair . 
"
15592914,16,6,"In all his ($_shouto) excitement cataloging plants he ($_shouto) almost missed Momo ($_momo) walking down the stairs dressed in a white sundress with a thick petticoat and a high button up collar and no sleeves . She had a parasol in her hand and white gloves that buttoned up to her mid forearm . Her hair was pulled back into a bun except for her bangs which were held back by a golden hair clip . She looked beautiful . 
"
15592914,16,7,"Momo ($_momo) you ($_momo) look amazing ! Are you ($_momo) going somewhere special ? 
"
15592914,16,8,"She blushed and smiled , then placed her hand over her heart . 
"
15592914,16,9,"I ($_momo) have a date with Jirou ($_jirou) ! A real date , not just walking around on her lunch hour or watching her play in a tavern . I ($_momo) made dinner reservations for us at a restaurant on the other side of town , and then we re going to see a live play at the local theatre ! 
"
15592914,16,10,"Wow! Sounds exciting! 
"
15592914,16,11,"Yes , I m a bit nervous but I ($_momo) m swallowing that fear and trying to focus on how happy I ($_momo) ll be to spend time with her . 
"
15592914,16,12,"Wait! If you ($_momo) re going on a date you ($_momo) ll need this , Izuku ($_izuku) said as he ($_izuku) rushed out of the door for a moment and came back with a bouquet of flowers . It was a small arrangement , but it was elegant and the flowers were all red which seemed to be a color that suited Momo ($_momo) . There was a single cut orchid surrounded by strands alstroemeria . It was wrapped in a white lace handkerchief with a red ribbon tying the whole thing together . He ($_izuku) handed it over to Momo . 
"
15592914,16,13,"Oh , Izuku ($_izuku) ! This is beautiful , thank you ($_momo) ! 
"
15592914,16,14,"It was nothing , I ($_momo) hope you ($_momo) have a lovely date ! 
"
15592914,16,15,"Thanks , I ($_momo) ll be back later ! 
"
15592914,16,16,"Izuku ($_izuku) watched her ($_izuku) leave with a spring in her ($_izuku) step and a smile on her ($_izuku) face . She ($_izuku) clutched the bouquet like it was an award she ($_izuku) was accepting . He liked to think the bouquet was a way to pay her ($_izuku) back for all the pastries she ($_izuku) d bought , but in truth he would have given it to her ($_izuku) anyways . She ($_izuku) was important to him , and Jirou ($_jirou) was important to her ($_izuku) , so he wanted to support them both in whatever ways he could . Besides , he d already cut a bunch of flowers that morning , it wasn t hard to throw together a quick arrangement of them for her ($_izuku) to take on her ($_izuku) date . 
"
15592914,16,17,"After watching her ($_izuku) go , Izuku ($_izuku) decided it was best to try and open up the shop now . He ($_izuku) went through the door and gathered up the bundles of flowers he ($_izuku) d cut that morning , and brought them to the shop , where he ($_izuku) tied them with twine and placed them in vases . 
"
15592914,16,18,"He ($_izuku) looked at his ($_izuku) notebook for a spell that helped preserve cut flowers . There were several ingredients that he ($_izuku) d need to get from the potion s room and then he ($_izuku) d have to boil them and then place it in the same room as the flowers while wafting the scent towards them . Maybe he ($_izuku) d try that later , he ($_izuku) decided . In the meantime he ($_izuku) decided the flowers could get by on a pep talk instead . He ($_izuku) got up on the stool that was at the counter , and made sure he ($_izuku) could be heard by all of them . 
"
15592914,16,19,"Hello , thank you for joining me today , he ($_izuku) said to them . Was that too formal? Did he ($_izuku) need an introduction ? I just wanted to let you know that you re all wonderful flowers who are going to last a very long time and make people happy ! I can t want to watch people walk out of th shop with smiles on their faces and bouquets in hand . I have every confidence that people will love you ! 
"
15592914,16,20,"With his speech done , Izuku ($_izuku) carefully got down from the stool . Maybe getting up there with his aching bones was a bad idea anyways . He couldn t want until he could get this curse lifted . 
"
15592914,16,21,"As he started to set up other things around the shop he found himself trying to analyze Shouto ($_shouto) s curse . He d do it line by line , just like he and Momo ($_momo) had tried to do when they thought it was an innocent spell they had to cast . He thought of the first line , Go and catch a falling star . That day Shinsou ($_shinsou) had said the_wizard ($_shouto) had caught a shooting star , so that was already done . But why had he done it ? If there was something wrong with catching shooting stars , then what had prompted Shouto ($_shouto) do to it himself ($_shouto) ? Besides , if a shooting star was a living thing then what had happened to the creature ? The only other living thing Shouto ($_shouto) had was - 
"
15592914,16,22,"Izuku ($_izuku) ran up the stairs and into the main room with the hearth . He ($_izuku) startled Rei , who had been sleeping in the dog bed by the fire . She ($_izuku) leapt at the intrusion , but upon seeing it was Izuku she ($_izuku) calmed down and went back to sleep again . Shinsou ($_shinsou) looked over at the man who d ran into the room . 
"
15592914,16,23,"What are you running for ? Are you alright ? 
"
15592914,16,24,"I m fine , I was just wondering were you ever a shooting star Shinsou ($_shinsou) ? 
"
15592914,16,25,"You finally noticed ? 
"
15592914,16,26,"Hey , I don t need your sass young man , Izuku ($_izuku) retorted . 
"
15592914,16,27,"I m not young , Izuku ($_izuku) . I m thousands of years old ! You should have more respect for your elders , you re only eighteen . 
"
15592914,16,28,"Izuku ($_izuku) stuck his ($_izuku) tongue out at the demon , who in turn brought out a fiery tongue and stuck it at Izuku ($_izuku) . Shinsou ($_shinsou) was older than Izuku ($_izuku) would ever get to be , even if his ($_shinsou) lifespan hadn t been magically shortened by sixty years . It made Izuku sad for a moment as he ($_shinsou) was reminded that if they didn t fix this curse he ($_shinsou) d only live about twenty years of life , maybe thirty if he ($_shinsou) was lucky . There was no way of knowing how long his ($_shinsou) lifespan was , even with all the detection magic in the world . He ($_shinsou) could have until tomorrow , or he ($_shinsou) could have a whole decade . 
"
15592914,16,29,"Anyways , The demon continued , snapping Izuku ($_izuku) out of his ($_izuku) negative thoughts . Now that you know I m a shooting star I can talk to you about it . The contract allows that much . 
"
15592914,16,30,"So you fell , and Shouto ($_shouto) caught you ? 
"
15592914,16,31,"Yes , it was shortly after he ($_shouto) left his ($_shouto) father I believe . I wasn t there for is life with Endeavor , but I ve seen everything afterwards . 
"
15592914,16,32,"What was it like , falling ? Momo and I tried to catch a star , but it said it was destined to die , and so it wouldn t let us save it . 
"
15592914,16,33,"It was terrifying , Shinsou ($_shinsou) admitted wearily . I felt myself lose my grip on the sky , and I started to fall to the earth below me faster than I d ever gone before . I was fighting it , trying to stay up desperately . I knew I was supposed to die , but before I could hit the ground I felt hands around me , lifting me up again . I looked up and there was this child , he had to be twelve or thirteen , and he was holding me . 
"
15592914,16,34,"And that was Shouto ($_shouto) . 
"
15592914,16,35,"Yes. He looked at me with wonder like I was the most amazing thing he d ever seen . When I told him I was dying , he offered to keep me alive the way that humans are kept alive . I would have done anything to stay alive , so I offered him a contract on the spot . He didn t really want my power , I think he just felt sorry for me . 
"
15592914,16,36,"Really? 
"
15592914,16,37,"Yes. Neither of us knew what we were getting ourselves into . We didn t realize what it was we were giving up , or what would happen once we did . 
"
15592914,16,38,"You can t tell me what it was that he gave you ? 
"
15592914,16,39,"Sorry , I can only spill so many beans . You ll have to figure that out on your own , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
15592914,16,40,"Heck , he cursed . Well , are you impressed that I figured out the first part ? 
"
15592914,16,41,"Yes , it only took you how long ? Has it been two weeks yet ? 
"
15592914,16,42,"I m not sure , I haven t been counting . It s so easy to get distracted in this place , with all the magic and - # ($_#) . And Shouto , the demon finished . 
"
15592914,16,43,"Well , I wasn t going to say that but - 
"
15592914,16,44,"You two have been acting different lately . You re holding hands more often and don t think I haven t notice you two are sharing a bed now - # ($_#) . Wow , Shinsou ($_shinsou) , would you look at the time ? I ve got to get going , Izuku ($_izuku) lied . 
"
15592914,16,45,"You re the worst , you re fooling no one , the demon bitterly cried after him as he retreated back down into the shop . 
"
15592914,16,46,"Izuku ($_izuku) was feeling quite impressed with himself ($_izuku) for figuring out part of the contract . Sure , he d had hints , but he d finally put it together . Who would guess looking at the demon that he was once a star in their sky ? He certainly didn t seem graceful enough for it . Were all the stars as crass as Shinsou ($_shinsou) was ? 
"
15592914,16,47,"That left Izuku ($_izuku) to analyze the other lines . There was , get with child a mandrake root , next and Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t sure what that one meant . Shouto ($_shouto) said it was one of two things to not happen yet . He ($_shouto) d have to keep mandrakes away from the wizard for the time being . Tell me where all past years are , seemed to be obvious to Shotuo but Izuku ($_izuku) didn t understand . The way that Shouto ($_shouto) had said it , it seemed like he ($_shouto) was saying he ($_shouto) could travel through past years as if it was nothing . Was traveling through the years even possible ? Izuku ($_izuku) knew that seeing into them was easy with divination or memory spells , but this was completely different . 
"
15592914,16,48,"He ($_shouto) had no clue what the line about the devil s foot meant . Shinsou ($_shinsou) was a demon and that was like a devil wasn t it ? But Shinsou ($_shinsou) was just fire , he ($_shinsou) didn t have legs . At the thought of Shinsou ($_shinsou) walking around on legs made of fire , Izuku ($_izuku) decided to move on immediately . If Shouto ($_shouto) figured that out already , it was good enough for him ($_shouto) . 
"
15592914,16,49,"The mermaids were also accounted for , so that just left the final line . Find what wind serves to advance an honest mind . Who was an honest mind ? It can t be me , I ve been doing a whole lot of lying recently . he ($_shinsou) thought to himself ($_shinsou) . He ($_shinsou) wasn t honest in his ($_shinsou) words or appearance , and neither was Shouto ($_shouto) with his ($_shinsou) potions and secrets . Who else is there that could be part of the curse ? Rei ($_rei) has been secretive as well , but Momo has been pretty open right ? Though I don t see how she ($_rei) falls into the curse . Maybe it s Shinsou ($_shinsou) ? He ($_shinsou) s not forthcoming with information but he ($_shinsou) s never actually lied to me that I know of . Then again , what does that have to do with wind ? 
"
15592914,16,50,"A ringing bell interrupted Izuku ($_izuku) s train of thought as he ($_shinsou) noticed the shop door open . In stepped a certain wizard , who seemed to take a moment to admire the lovely bouquets that were all around the shop now . Izuku ($_izuku) smiled . 
"
15592914,16,51,"I m sorry sir , the shop isn t open yet . You ll have to wait another day or so until I m ready for customers , he teased as he walked over to Shouto . 
"
15592914,16,52,"Oh no , whatever will I do ? I guess I ll just wait here then . 
"
15592914,16,53,"Welcome home , said Izuku as he stood on his tippy toes and leaned on Shouto ($_shouto) s chest to plant a kiss on his cheek . 
"
15592914,16,54,"Thanks . The shop is coming along nicely , Izuku ($_izuku) . Do you need any help setting up ? 
"
15592914,16,55,"I think I m more or less good . I was afraid the spell for preserving flowers would take too long , so I gave the bouquets a pep talk instead . Hopefully it should last a little while . 
"
15592914,16,56,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked closely at the flowers , seeming to consider whether they ($_shouto) were sufficiently magical or not . His ($_shouto) eyes widened , and he ($_shouto) turned back to Izuku . 
"
15592914,16,57,"I I think you went a little overboard . These flowers won t wilt for three months . 
"
15592914,16,58,"Oh , how long does the spell usually last ? 
"
15592914,16,59,"Three weeks , muttered Shouto , who was clearly deep in thought . You must have really inspired them ($_shouto) or scared them ($_shouto) . I m unsure , but they ($_shouto) re very motivated to not wilt . 
"
15592914,16,60,"I just asked them ($_shouto) kindly ! Izuku ($_izuku) was offended at the idea that he ($_izuku) would be anything but kind to his ($_izuku) plants . He ($_izuku) had assumed being mean to the flowers would make them ($_shouto) wilt all the sooner . 
"
15592914,16,61,"I believe you , don t worry . I can t picture you ever being mean , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
15592914,16,62,"T-thanks , Shouto ($_shouto) . 
"
15592914,16,63,"Was that it , or did you need any other assistance ? 
"
15592914,16,64,"Well , Izuku ($_izuku) tried to think . He ($_izuku) didn t want Shouto ($_shouto) to leave , but what did he ($_izuku) need help with . He ($_izuku) blurted out the first thing that came to mind . I need you to put this vase up on that shelf ! 
"
15592914,16,65,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked at the shelf in question . It ($_shouto) was the second one up , and while it ($_shouto) was probably about face level with Izuku ($_izuku) that was n't out of reach for either of them . He ($_izuku) looked puzzled . 
"
15592914,16,66,"That shelf ? Are you sure ? 
"
15592914,16,67,"Y-yes ! It s too high for me . I m so short , you know 
"
15592914,16,68,"Shouto ($_shouto) took the vase without hesitation , but he ($_shouto) was evidently still questioning the other man s motives . He ($_shouto) placed it centered on the shelf , and made sure it was straightened before he ($_shouto) looked back to Izuku . 
"
15592914,16,69,"Is that good ? Do you need anything else ? 
"
15592914,16,70,"Yes and yes! I he ($_shouto) started to look around , but before he ($_shouto) could respond he ($_shouto) noticed Shouto ($_shouto) come over and lean on the countertop , looking at him ($_shouto) doubtfully . 
"
15592914,16,71,"You know if you just want me to stay here , all you have to do is ask . 
"
15592914,16,72,"Oh. 
"
15592914,16,73,"I m here to help if you need me , even if that help if just keeping you company for a bit . 
"
15592914,16,74,"Yea ... I think I d like that . Thank you Shouto . 
"
15592914,16,75,"The wizard chuckled at him ($_shouto) , and if it wasn t such a cute laugh Izuku might have been upset . He ($_shouto) pretended to be upset , but in a way that was obvious it was a joke . He ($_shouto) dipped his ($_shouto) hand into a water basin that was holding plants . When he ($_shouto) brought it back up he ($_shouto) flicked the water at Shotuo . Not about to let Izuku ($_izuku) have the satisfaction of throwing water at him ($_shouto) , he ($_shouto) heated up the side of his ($_shouto) body enough that the water evaporated instantly . 
"
15592914,16,76,"That s cheating and you know it , Izuku ($_izuku) protested quietly . 
"
15592914,16,77,"Still , the smirk on Shouto ($_shouto) s face made it easy to forgive him ($_shouto) . Looking at that smiling face it was easy to forget the curses and contracts that they were both confined by . All the things Shouto ($_shouto) had been through and would go through if this curse took hold weren t on Izuku ($_izuku) s mind when he ($_shouto) looked at the wizard . It was nothing but the smile of the man he ($_shouto) loved .
