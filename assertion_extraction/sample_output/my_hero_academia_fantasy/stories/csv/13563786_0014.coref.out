13563786,14,1,"Even as the others are following him ($_bakugou) away from where he ($_bakugou) is sure the person living here is hiding , Bakugou ($_bakugou) keeps his ($_bakugou) senses focused on the person spying on them . When it 's clear they will not be followed and the person is beyond his senses he stops and turns to his party . 
"
13563786,14,2,"Not one of you noticed them , buncha idiots . 
"
13563786,14,3,"Noticed who? 
"
13563786,14,4,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) tilts his ($_kirishima) head , looking back from where they had been , his ($_kirishima) frill flapping as he ($_kirishima) shakes his ($_kirishima) head . 
"
13563786,14,5,"You mean the person spying on us before we crossed the river ? 
"
13563786,14,6,"Hah ! At least one of you boneheads noticed them . 
"
13563786,14,7,"If we were being spied on , why didn t either of you say anything ? What if they re dangerous ? 
"
13563786,14,8,"They stayed behind after we moved into the trees . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s probably scared them off from trying to do anything . 
"
13563786,14,9,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) nods , He s right . Most bandits and thieves would certainly try to avoid a confrontation with a dragon . 
"
13563786,14,10,"Oh , I suppose that s true . So , do you think whoever they were they left ? 
"
13563786,14,11,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) shrugs , Maybe , but let s not worry about that right now . Come on , the ruins are this way . 
"
13563786,14,12,"It 's not long before they come across a crumbling stone wall . Gaps in the stone that may have at one time been windows show that the structure once was spacious inside . Now though several trees and bushes have grown between the stones of the floor , forcing up the ground where roots have heaved the floor . 
"
13563786,14,13,"This place is ancient . 
"
13563786,14,14,"Yeah. Izuku ($_izuku) is the first to crawl through one of the gaps and into the ruins . Once inside he stares around with a strange look on his face . 
"
13563786,14,15,"Izuku ($_izuku) ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) and Todoroki ($_todoroki) hurry after their smaller companion while Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifts his ($_kirishima) bulk from foot to foot , his ($_kirishima) size preventing him ($_kirishima) from following . 
"
13563786,14,16,"Don t run ahead like that ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabs the green haired young man s arm , drawing his ($_bakugou) attention to the beast king . 
"
13563786,14,17,"Sorry , it 's just , this place feels familiar . It 's weird . 
"
13563786,14,18,"It 's possible you came here on occasion before the_capitol ($_the) fell , this place is rather beautiful , I imagine it ($_the) would have once been a place that families might have visited . 
"
13563786,14,19,"Izuku ($_izuku) doesn t look convinced , That doesn t seem right . Something draws Izuku ($_izuku) attention further into the ruins and he turns , taking a step . 
"
13563786,14,20,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) s grip on his ($_bakugou) arm is the only thing holding him ($_bakugou) back . 
"
13563786,14,21,"Footsteps make their way toward them from the direction Izuku is facing and Bakugou ($_bakugou) s grip tightens on the other s arm . A growl rises from his ($_bakugou) throat as a shadowed figure becomes visible , their hands held up in a sign of peace . 
"
13563786,14,22,"I mean you no harm . The figure steps from the shadows of the trees into a beam of light , golden hair catching the light . The man s lank form is swimming in an oversized tunic that has seen better days . 
"
13563786,14,23,"Who the fuck are you old man ? 
"
13563786,14,24,"Izuku ($_izuku) . The man takes a steps forward , his eyes locked on the green haired young man and his arms held open as if to embrace him . 
"
13563786,14,25,"Izuku ($_izuku) likewise is unable to remove his gaze from this broken looking man . 
"
13563786,14,26,"I was so worried , I feared the worst when you and your mother never returned . 
"
13563786,14,27,"Izuku ($_izuku) blinks , locked in place by his ($_izuku) own shock and the tightening grip Bakugou ($_bakugou) has on his ($_izuku) arm . You know me ? 
"
13563786,14,28,"The blonde man frowns , his ($_izuku) gaunt face looking all the more broken at Izuku ($_izuku) s comment . You don t remember me ? 
"
13563786,14,29,"No_,_I_m_sorry_,_Izuku ($_,) shakes his ($_,) head . I lost most of my memories years ago . I know a few things , like I used to live in the_capitol ($_the) , but I must have hit my head when my mother and I were escaping . 
"
13563786,14,30,"The man s shoulders curl in , his head dropping from it 's proud position . He looks impossibly more broken . Yes , I knew you . I ve been waiting for you , for so long . Tell me , what happened to your mother . 
"
13563786,14,31,"My mother ? Izuku ($_izuku) s face shows his ($_izuku) guilt , this man must have known her ($_izuku) as well . I m sorry , she ($_izuku) died years ago . The journey through the mountains was too much for her ($_izuku) with the injuries she ($_izuku) sustained during our escape . 
"
13563786,14,32,"The man s shoulders shake and he turns his face away from them , grief overtaking his features before he turns back to those standing across from him . I m sorry to hear that . Your mother was a kind and caring woman . The man turns from the small party , waving a hand in a beckoning motion to have them follow him . Come this way . I have something for you that was left by your father . I have been waiting here for you in the hopes you would return to claim it . 
"
13563786,14,33,"Izuku ($_izuku) moves to follow , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) yanks him ($_izuku) back by his ($_izuku) arm . Not so fast old man . You didn t answer my question . Who are you ? 
"
13563786,14,34,"The blonde looks back over his ($_izuku) shoulder at the question . I am Yagi Toshinori , a former knight under the king turned hermit . Does that answer your question young man ? 
"
13563786,14,35,"Tch ($_tch) , suppose it ($_tch) does . The angry blonde lets go of Izuku ($_izuku) s arm , letting him ($_izuku) follow after the other blonde . 
"
13563786,14,36,"Izuku ($_izuku) looks back at Bakugou ($_bakugou) before following after Yagi , the other two keeping pace with him ($_izuku) .
