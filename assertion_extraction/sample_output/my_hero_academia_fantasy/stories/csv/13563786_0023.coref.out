13563786,23,1,"In the moment following Izuku ($_izuku) s statement Bakugou and Todoroki ($_todoroki) share a look . It is an exchange of words without a single sound , they both understand this will not end well for any of them if they stay , but one of them will have to . 
"
13563786,23,2,"Come here. Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabs the from of Todoroki ($_todoroki) s shirt and yanks him ($_bakugou) forward , his ($_bakugou) other arm still wrapped around Izuku ($_izuku) . Been wanting to do this for while , so don t let it be the last . Following those words he ($_bakugou) closes the distance between them and kisses the dual-colored prince . 
"
13563786,23,3,"Izuku ($_izuku) makes a choked sound that squeaks from his ($_izuku) throat at the kiss taking place inches from his ($_izuku) own face . When Bakugou ($_bakugou) releases Todoroki ($_todoroki) , the prince looks dazed and flustered . 
"
13563786,23,4,"Don ($_don) t die , got it . He ($_don) breathes out before his ($_don) eyes settle on the now red face of the other prince . He ($_don) offers the other a smile before leaning down and pressing his ($_don) lips to Izuku ($_izuku) s. Go , you two need to get out of here . 
"
13563786,23,5,"But , Todoroki ($_todoroki) , Bakugou is already lifting Izuku ($_izuku) , despite his ($_izuku) struggles , and climbing onto Kirishima ($_kirishima) s back . Bakugou ($_bakugou) , we can t , we can t leave him ($_izuku) ! 
"
13563786,23,6,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) had been shielding them from the knights and soldiers as well as the king s hellfire , when he ($_izuku) feels himself ($_izuku) being climbed on he ($_izuku) spares a moment to see that it is Bakugou ($_bakugou) and Izuku ($_izuku) , though the_smaller_man ($_don) is struggling to be let go . 
"
13563786,23,7,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) , make sure they ($_kirishima) get out of here . I ll do what I can to buy you all time . 
"
13563786,23,8,"At the dragon s hesitation Todoroki ($_todoroki) draws his ($_izuku) sword and begins to summon ice . 
"
13563786,23,9,"Go , there isn t much time . 
"
13563786,23,10,"An explosion rips through the throne room as Bakugou ($_bakugou) uses his ($_izuku) new height to blast a hole in the ceiling , bits of wood raining down on everyone as Kirishima ($_kirishima) unfurls his ($_izuku) wings from their protective cocoon in order to begin flapping them to gain altitude . 
"
13563786,23,11,"The moment he ($_izuku) does a lance of energy races towards him ($_izuku) and in the blink of an eye it pierces through his ($_izuku) heart . 
"
13563786,23,12,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) watches in horror as Kirishima ($_kirishima) lets out a billowing roar full of pain before slumping to the floor of the throne room , his passengers being flung off somewhere by the violent crash . 
"
13563786,23,13,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) ! 
"
13563786,23,14,"The dragon lay unmoving , an ever larger puddle of red seeping out from beneath him . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s face is twisted in rage as tears gather in his ($_bakugou) eyes before escaping in twin rivers down his ($_bakugou) cheeks . 
"
13563786,23,15,"You bastards , you ll pay for this ! 
"
13563786,23,16,"I rather think I will not . 
"
13563786,23,17,"Both young men turn to see the seer , All For One , striding out across the room , a wicked grin on his face . 
"
13563786,23,18,"You ll both be joining your friend soon enough . 
"
13563786,23,19,"Izuku coughs as he rises to his knees after being thrown from Kirishima ($_kirishima) . He can hear Bakugou ($_bakugou) screaming about something , but his mind is too muddled from everything that s happened to understand it . 
"
13563786,23,20,"The crunch of rubble under feet has the prince looking up and seeing the source of all the evil in his life towering over him . He can vaguely hear the others shouting at him , explosions going off and pounding footsteps . 
"
13563786,23,21,"Hand over the sword , boy , and I ll be willing to make this painless . 
"
13563786,23,22,"No , His voice is weak , trembling as this man from a nightmare towers over him . Even so he wonders why the king s fire has stopped , and the knights . Looking behind the sorcerer he sees the king , frozen in a moment , hand raised to release his fire , but his eyes are empty black husks . A fearful glance around shows the same to be true for the knights . 
"
13563786,23,23,"What , what did you do to them ? 
"
13563786,23,24,"It 's not easy to take down a dragon , their lives were necessary to prevent your escape . Now hand over the sword and your friends won t need to suffer the same fate . 
"
13563786,23,25,"A wall of ice is thrown up between the two as Todoroki ($_todoroki) finally reaches Izuku ($_izuku) s side . 
"
13563786,23,26,"Izuku ($_izuku) , are you alright ? 
"
13563786,23,27,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) . Tears well in the green haired man s eyes . I m sorry , I don t think , His words are cut off by the shattering of ice and the scream from the dual colored prince as his shoulder is pierced by a stone spike , pinning him to the floor beside Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
13563786,23,28,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) ! 
"
13563786,23,29,"Now , hand over the sword or watch him die . The sorcerer holds out his free hand toward the smaller prince . 
"
13563786,23,30,"Don ($_don) t do it . Izuku ($_izuku) , don t. 
"
13563786,23,31,"Tears still in his ($_izuku) eyes Izuku ($_izuku) manages to gain his ($_izuku) feet , sword once more held shakily between his ($_izuku) hands in a tight grip . I won t , I won t let you hurt anymore people . Not my friends , not anyone . I ll stop you . 
"
13563786,23,32,"All For One flicks his wrist at Izuku ($_izuku) s stubborn stance , a sharp projectile flying past him and leaving a scratch on his cheek before hitting it 's target with a wet thunk . 
"
13563786,23,33,"The world around them slows down as Izuku ($_izuku) looks over his ($_izuku) shoulder to see the light ebbing from Todoroki ($_todoroki) s eyes , a crystal spike embedded in the center of his ($_izuku) chest . 
"
13563786,23,34,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) ? the blade slips from slack fingers as Izuku ($_izuku) drops to his ($_izuku) knees beside the now dead prince . Todoroki ($_todoroki) ! Wake up! Please , no , you can t Izuku ($_izuku) grips the front of his ($_izuku) companion s shirt in both hands , fisting it as his ($_izuku) sobs shake his ($_izuku) small form . 
"
13563786,23,35,"You bastard ! An explosion hits All For One from behind , causing him ($_izuku) to stumble as he ($_izuku) was bending to pick up the fallen sword . The explosion served as enough of a distraction for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to run in between Izuku ($_izuku) and the sorcerer and grab the sword himself ($_izuku) . Armed with the sword in one hand and explosions ready in his ($_izuku) other , the beast king faces off with their enemy . 
"
13563786,23,36,"Tch , you think you can stop me . A flick of his ($_izuku) wrist and several spikes of crystal hover around him ($_izuku) . You don t stand a chance boy . Another gesture and the spikes all fly at Bakugou , one embedding itself in the elbow of the arm not holding One For All . 
"
13563786,23,37,"Is that all you ve got old man ? 
"
13563786,23,38,"Oh , I wasn t aiming for you . 
"
13563786,23,39,"Eyes widening in horror Bakugou slowly turns to look behind him ($_izuku) to see Izuku ($_izuku) slumped forward over Todoroki , crystal spikes embedded in his ($_izuku) back near his ($_izuku) heart . The green haired prince s eyes stare vacantly into the distance , their light gone . 
"
13563786,23,40,"Izuku ($_izuku) ? Burning , prickling rage begins to overtake Bakugou ($_bakugou) as he ($_bakugou) turns with fire in his ($_bakugou) eyes towards the cause of all this death . You , He ($_bakugou) reaches up and grips the sword he ($_bakugou) holds between his ($_bakugou) teeth , his ($_bakugou) now free hand jerking the crystal spike from his ($_bakugou) elbow before going back to the hilt of the sword . I ll kill you , for what you ve done , I ll show you no mercy . 
"
13563786,23,41,"All For One lets out a sinister chuckle at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s words . You don t stand a chance of stopping me boy , and once I kill you , that sword of power will be mine . 
"
13563786,23,42,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) growls as he ($_bakugou) looks down at the sword , a weapon of the fae . This_man_before_him ($_bakugou) him ($_bakugou) had razed entire cities to obtain it ($_bakugou) . Had killed everyone he ($_bakugou) cared about . All for this blade that rests in his ($_bakugou) hands . 
"
13563786,23,43,"No , it won t. with a wince of pain , Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabs the blade with his ($_bakugou) other hand , now holding it at the hilt as well as along the blade . Blood drips from his ($_bakugou) palm as his ($_bakugou) grip tightens . 
"
13563786,23,44,"What are you doing ? 
"
13563786,23,45,"I m not letting you get what you want . 
"
13563786,23,46,"Explosions begin to go off in each of his ($_bakugou) hands , his ($_bakugou) fingers and palms bursting from the strength of them , but even with his ($_bakugou) hands destroyed , the blade falls to pieces at his ($_bakugou) feet and he ($_bakugou) gives the sorcerer a smirk of triumph . 
"
13563786,23,47,"Even if you kill me now , you still won t get what you want , bastard . 
"
13563786,23,48,"The scream of rage echoes through the destroyed throne room and All For One through his palms out toward Bakugou ($_bakugou) a concussive force slams into him , causing his chest to cave in under the pressure . Blood trickles from his mouth as he s thrown on top of Izuku and Todoroki ($_todoroki) , the smile still on his face at having prevented this_mad_man ($_bakugou) from getting what he wanted . His eyes drift closed and he goes limp , his last breath stilling in his lungs .
