"
12859776,2,2,"Izuku ($_izuku) hunched his ($_izuku) shoulders as he ($_izuku) continued to scribble furiously in his ($_izuku) notebook . This was his ($_izuku) 13th notebook dedicated to analyzing the unique wandless magic that everyone in the magical community possessed . 
"
12859776,2,3,"Quirks . 
"
12859776,2,4,"In addition to performing wand magic , each magical individual could perform a wandless spell that was quite versatile and varied in nature . There were inherently combat quirks , transportation quirks , enhancing quirks , metamorphosis quirks , etc. . Izuku ($_izuku) enjoyed observing and analyzing quirks , particularly because he ($_izuku) lacked one of his ($_izuku) own . He ($_izuku) wanted to understand how these wandless spells worked and why they , along with wand magic , were only present in part of the population . 
"
12859776,2,5,"In his ($_izuku) notebooks , Izuku ($_izuku) recorded his ($_izuku) observations about his ($_izuku) classmates . Bakugou in particular had quite a few pages dedicated just to him ($_izuku) . Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) quirk was that he ($_izuku) could cause explosions to erupt from his ($_izuku) body . The effect seemed to be localized to his ($_izuku) hands , but Izuku ($_izuku) concluded that this might not necessarily be the case . 
"
12859776,2,6,"Izuku_'s ($_'s) musings were interrupted by a loud bang and a smoking hand that had slammed down on his ($_'s) open notebook . Bakugou ($_bakugou) grinned menacingly as Izuku ($_izuku) hesitantly met his ($_bakugou) gaze . 
"
12859776,2,7,"`` What 's this , Deku ($_deku) ? '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked as he ($_bakugou) snatched the notebook off the desk . `` Hero Analysis for the Future ? The fuck are you writing this for ? You 'll never be a hero . In fact , I ($_bakugou) 'll do you a favor right now . '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) held the notebook between two open palms . Izuku ($_izuku) scrambled out of his ($_izuku) chair . He ($_izuku) knew what was about to happen . 
"
12859776,2,8,"`` Kacchan wait - '' He ($_izuku) was interrupted by another loud bang . The notebook erupted into quickly fading flames . Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked before tossing the remains out the window . Izuku ($_izuku) ran to watch as the book fell into the school 's koi pond . He ($_izuku) almost fell as he ($_izuku) leaned over the windowsill , held up only by the hand that grabbed the back of his ($_izuku) uniform . 
"
12859776,2,9,"`` Hang on , Deku ($_deku) . If you die now , I 'll be the one in trouble . '' The hand yanked him ($_izuku) back roughly , letting him ($_izuku) fall to the floor . Bakugou ($_bakugou) walked towards the door , his ($_bakugou) goons scrambling after him ($_bakugou) . 
"
12859776,2,10,"`` But if you want to take a swan dive off the roof when I leave ... well that 'd be no one 's fault but your own . '' He ($_bakugou) gave a bark of laugher , `` Maybe you 'll have magic in your next life . '' He ($_bakugou) walked off , still laughing . 
"
12859776,2,11,"Izuku ($_izuku) felt tears welling in his ($_izuku) eyes . As much as he ($_izuku) wanted to think that Bakugou ($_bakugou) did n't mean what he ($_izuku) said , he ($_izuku) had known the boy for many years now . Bakugou , no matter how cruel it may seem , always said what he ($_izuku) meant . Izuku ($_izuku) climbed to his ($_izuku) feet slowly and finished packing his ($_izuku) bag . On his ($_izuku) way out of school , he ($_izuku) stopped by the koi pond . He ($_izuku) fished out his ($_izuku) notebook , noting that it was n't salvageable and that he ($_izuku) 'd need to copy his ($_izuku) notes to another book . 
"
12859776,2,12,"Izuku_'s ($_'s) mind whirred with sad thoughts and questions . 
"
12859776,2,13,"If Kacchan ($_kacchan) says I ($_kacchan) should die ... maybe he ($_kacchan) 's right . Am I ($_kacchan) useless ? Can I ($_kacchan) not be a hero ? 
"
12859776,2,14,"As he ($_kacchan) walked under a bridge , a scraping noise rang from behind him ($_kacchan) . Izuku ($_izuku) was still lost in his ($_izuku) thoughts when a figure crept up from behind and grabbed him ($_izuku) . Slimy appendages caught Izuku_'s ($_'s) hands and kept them trapped behind his ($_izuku) back . 
"
12859776,2,15,"`` Wha-what 's going on ? Help! Somebody he ($_izuku) - '' Izuku_'s ($_'s) cries were cut off as more slimy appendages covered his ($_'s) mouth . Once again , Izuku_'s ($_'s) eyes filled with tears . A loud clanging noise sounded from behind the two grappling figures . 
"
12859776,2,16,"`` TEXAS SMASH ! '' yelled a large voice as the figure attacking Izuku ($_izuku) was blown away . Izuku_'s ($_'s) eyes widened - only one person was renown for their famous smashes . 
"
12859776,2,17,"`` It 's all right now , '' the tall and broad figure grinned widely , `` Why ? Because I AM HERE ! '' 
"
12859776,2,18,"Izuku ($_izuku) blacked out . 
"
12859776,2,19,"Izuku ($_izuku) woke up to a large hand shaking his ($_izuku) shoulder gently . 
"
12859776,2,20,"`` Young man ? I can not leave until I know you are safely on your way home . '' said a loud voice . 
"
12859776,2,21,"Izuku ($_izuku) scrubbed his ($_izuku) eyes , still incredulous about what was happening . 
"
12859776,2,22,"`` Ah , there we go . Thank you for your help ! If you had n't stalled him ($_izuku) , a dangerous criminal would still be on the loose . '' All_Might ($_all) stood back up next to the restrained villain . Izuku ($_izuku) finally got a good look at who had attacked him ($_izuku) , and he ($_izuku) immediately began analyzing and attempting to comprehend the villain and his ($_izuku) abilities . The_villain ($_izuku) himself ($_izuku) was rather plain-looking , if one ignored the slimy tentacle-like appendages that lay limply on the ground , shackled to each other . As Izuku ($_izuku) began muttering to himself ($_izuku) about the technicalities of such a quirk , All Might prepared to disapparate away . 
"
12859776,2,23,"`` Farewell , young man . '' Izuku_'s ($_'s) eyes widened as he ($_'s) regained his ($_'s) senses just in time . 
"
12859776,2,24,"`` No wait ! '' Izuku ($_izuku) launched himself ($_izuku) at All Might right as the man completed his spell . The three figures vanished from beneath the bridge , leaving a pair of empty shackles in their wake . All_Might ($_all) stumbled as he ($_'s) landed on the roof of a nearby building . The_additional_passenger ($_'s) had not been accounted for in his ($_'s) spell , and he ($_'s) could not complete the journey lest some harm befall the boy . He ($_'s) quickly glanced at his ($_'s) surroundings , ensuring the criminal was still present before turning his ($_'s) attention to Izuku , who was collapsed on all four limbs . 
"
12859776,2,25,"`` Are you all right , my boy ? That was a very dangerous thing you did , but I must admit I 'm curious about your reason . '' he ($_'s) asked . 
"
12859776,2,26,"`` Yes ... I ($_izuku) 'm ... fine , '' Izuku ($_izuku) replied , panting with exertion , `` I. . . need ... a moment . '' 
"
12859776,2,27,"`` Of course . '' said All_Might ($_all) , glancing at his ($_'s) watch in his ($_'s) peripheral vision - three hours had already passed since he ($_'s) began chasing the_villain ($_izuku) . 
"
12859776,2,28,"Izuku ($_izuku) finally stood up , his ($_izuku) entire frame shaking in awe and anticipation , but kept his ($_izuku) face down . 
"
12859776,2,29,"`` All Might ... can I still be a hero , even without magic ? Is it possible for someone like me to ever become as amazing as you ? I 've always looked up to you , ever since I saw your debut . What you do - saving countless people with a fearless smile on your face - it 's extraordinary . But ... I do n't have magic , and when I say I still want to be a hero , everyone laughs . But if just one person believes in me , especially you , then I know - '' Izuku ($_izuku) glances at his ($_izuku) idol and shrieks . Rather than the tall and strong-looking man he ($_izuku) expected to see , the only figure in Izuku_'s ($_'s) vision was an emaciated and gaunt living skeleton . 
"
12859776,2,30,"`` W-where 's All Might ? '' he ($_izuku) asked . The man opened his mouth to answer , but instead spit out blood . He glanced at his hands in resignation before looking up . 
"
12859776,2,31,"`` I am All Might . '' he says . `` I 've been using a glamour spell to hide myself . '' All_Might ($_all) slowly sits down on the concrete roof . `` Fearless smile ? Everyone has fear , kid . '' He lifts his shirt to point out a gruesome scar over his heart . `` 5 years ago , I was severely injured by a villain . My organs were irreparably damaged and what you see now are the consequences . I did n't tell the public because they call me the Symbol of Peace . If the hero with a fearless smile gets taken down by a criminal , people will lose hope . That smile I wear is to reassure those I try to save , but that does n't mean I 'm fearless . No hero is fearless , and to conquer that fear we must use the best tools at our disposal . Being a hero without having magic , the most powerful tool of all , wo n't be possible . '' He stood up again and made his way to the door . `` Heroes are n't the only ones who save people . You could always join the non-magical society and become a policeman or a fireman , or even a doctor . They might not be as popular as heroes , but they do their fair share of saving too ... Dreams are good , kid , but do n't ignore reality . '' All_Might ($_all) shut the door behind him . 
"
12859776,2,32,"Izuku ($_izuku) was destroyed . 
"
12859776,2,33,"`` I-if even All Might ... '' he mumbled to himself as he slowly headed towards the door . Izuku ($_izuku) had lost all hope . 
"
12859776,2,34,"`` Maybe Kacchan 's right . I am a useless nobody . Maybe they 're all right . Why does the magical gene have such a large impact on someone 's life ? Should society really be structured this way ? Is that fair to those who are n't magical ? Whether they 're squibs or part of the non-ma - '' Izuku ($_izuku) was interrupted by a large boom . He ($_izuku) looked to his ($_izuku) right and saw smoke plumes rising above the buildings . Without a second thought , he ($_izuku) ran straight towards the noise . The closer he ($_izuku) got , the more frequently the noises sounded . He ($_izuku) saw a large crowd , all of them clamoring to see the cause of the disturbance . Izuku , unable to see anything over their heads , suddenly glanced down in despondence . 
"
12859776,2,35,"`` Why am I torturing myself by coming here ? '' he ($_izuku) asked himself ($_izuku) . As he ($_izuku) turned to leave , he ($_izuku) overheard some voices in the crowd . 
"
12859776,2,36,"`` Oh , I ($_izuku) feel so bad for that poor middle-school kid . '' 
"
12859776,2,37,"`` Yeah , those heroes are n't even doing anything , even though a villain 's got him . '' 
"
12859776,2,38,"`` That 's an amazing quirk he 's got - exploding things . Too bad it wo n't do him any good right now . '' 
"
12859776,2,39,"Izuku ($_izuku) spun back around , worry and apprehension stinging his ($_izuku) nerves . He ($_izuku) ran into the crowd , ducking and dodging people 's arms and legs as he ($_izuku) headed to the front of the group . When he ($_izuku) reache dthe front , he ($_izuku) was pushed back by a hero , identifiable only by costume rather than behavior . 
"
12859776,2,40,"`` Stay back , kid . Let the heroes handle this . '' they say . Izuku ($_izuku) peers over the arm held in front of him ($_izuku) . One of his ($_izuku) worst fears is confirmed when he ($_izuku) saw Bakugou ($_bakugou) in the midst of chaos . There were fires all over the place , and the villain Izuku ($_izuku) had encountered earlier was present as well , smiling with grotesque features . Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) arms and legs were tangled with slimy-looking tentacles , which allowed the villain to control his ($_bakugou) every move . This was quite dangerous considering the boy was letting off near-constant explosions as he ($_bakugou) struggled to escape . The_villain ($_izuku) had also covered Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) mouth and nose with slimy fingers , which was a clear indication that he ($_bakugou) meant to suffocate him ($_bakugou) . Izuku_'s ($_'s) eyes locked with Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) and Izuku ($_izuku) ran . For the first time since they ($_bakugou) were toddlers , Izuku ($_izuku) saw a cry for help within the bright red eyes of his ($_izuku) once friend . 
"
12859776,2,41,"Izuku_'s ($_'s) mind whirred as his ($_'s) feet carried him ($_'s) towards Bakugou ($_bakugou) . He ($_'s) had not carefully thought about what he ($_'s) would do next , but he ($_'s) knew he ($_'s) had to do something . Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) eyes widened as Izuku ($_izuku) approached , unidentifiable emotions shining through . Izuku ($_izuku) was merely a few feet away from the villain when he ($_izuku) got an idea . He ($_izuku) shrugged off his ($_izuku) backpack and launched it towards the_villain_'s ($_izuku) face . Then , he ($_izuku) quickly grabbed Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) bicep and jerked him ($_izuku) to the side , effectively preventing the_villain ($_izuku) from using Bakugou ($_bakugou) as a shield . Izuku ($_izuku) began pulling off the tentacles on Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) face , struggling as he ($_izuku) noticed that they were a jello-like substance rather than something solid . He ($_izuku) realized that this was why the heroes were hesitating but kept struggling nonetheless . Somehow , he ($_izuku) managed to free Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) mouth , allowing him ($_izuku) to take a deep breath . 
"
12859776,2,42,"`` Why are you ($_izuku) here ? What are you ($_izuku) doing ? '' he ($_izuku) asked as soon as he ($_izuku) had caught his ($_izuku) breath . Isuzu began yanking at Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) arms , trying and failing to free him ($_izuku) . 
"
12859776,2,43,"`` I ($_izuku) 'm sorry , Kacchan ! I ($_izuku) could n't help it , once I ($_izuku) saw your eyes crying for helping , my ($_izuku) feet moved on their own ! '' Izuku ($_izuku) replied . 
"
12859776,2,44,"`` I. . ."" Bakugou ($_bakugou) trailed off , refusing to finish his ($_bakugou) thought . The two were still struggling to no avail when a voice was heard . 
"
12859776,2,45,"`` DETROIT SMASH ! '' exclaimed All_Might ($_all) , punching the air in front of the_villain ($_izuku) . Extreme air pressure blew the_villain ($_izuku) away , leaving the two boys in place solely due to the hands gripping their arms . The crowd cheered , calling out the Symbol of Peace 's hero name with joy and awe . Meanwhile , EMTs ($_emts) swarmed Izuku ($_izuku) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) , checking them ($_emts) for injuries . 
"
12859776,2,46,"`` That was very brave of you . Did you use precision magic to ensure your backpack hit its mark ? '' one of them ($_emts) asked Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
12859776,2,47,"`` W-well , I do n't actually have any magic ... '' Izuku_'s ($_'s) voice faded out as he ($_'s) saw the shock and disapproval rising on the_EMT_'s ($_the) face . 
"
12859776,2,48,"`` That was a very dangerous thing you did ! Next time , leave it to those with magic , kid . '' replies the_EMT ($_the) before he ($_'s) heads Izuku ($_izuku) his ($_'s) backpack . 
"
12859776,2,49,"Izuku ($_izuku) walked home , sadness and , strangely , contentment permeating the air around him ($_'s) . He ($_izuku) spun around when he ($_izuku) heard footsteps thundering behind him ($_izuku) . # . "" DEKU ! '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) said as he ($_izuku) glared , `` You ($_izuku) may have saved me ($_bakugou) , but do n't think that this makes you ($_izuku) better than me ($_bakugou) ! I ($_bakugou) 'm still going to be the number one hero , even if I ($_bakugou) might owe you ($_izuku) ! '' He ($_izuku) spun around on his ($_izuku) heel and marched back where he ($_izuku) came from . 
"
12859776,2,50,"Izuku ($_izuku) turned back around and began walking again . He ($_izuku) had n't expected Bakugou ($_bakugou) to show any gratitude , but Izuku ($_izuku) was glad to see that he ($_izuku) had rebounded so quickly from a near-death experience . He ($_izuku) truly hoped that he ($_izuku) was able to achieve his ($_izuku) dream , even if Izuku himself ($_izuku) had given up . 
"
12859776,2,51,"It is n't so bad , not being a hero . I was still able to help save Kacchan , Maybe that 's enough ... 
"
12859776,2,52,"A gust of wind blew from beside him ($_izuku) , and suddenly , the sun was blocked from his ($_izuku) person . He ($_izuku) looked up and saw All Might , complete with the majestic glamour that hid the hero 's true self . 
"
12859776,2,53,"`` You know , all heroes start their journey somewhat the same . If they find someone in danger , they do n't stop for a second to think before trying to help . Of course , such reckless behavior may lead to disaster , but ... such extraordinary courage is a trait present in all those who become great heroes . What you did today ... I hesitated , kid . When I saw that boy in trouble , I hesitated because I had used up all my energy trying to capture that villain in the first place . If it was n't for you , running in when no one else would , I would n't have found the courage to draw out strength when I thought there was none left . Thank you . '' The illusion faded away , leaving the gaunt figure of All Might 's true body . `` What I told you earlier , that was wrong . I had forgotten the true meaning of being a hero . A hero is someone who does what 's right , even if they have to struggle more than others . And you , my boy , can reach your dream . '' Izuku ($_izuku) fell to his ($_izuku) knees , sobbing as hope welled inside him ($_izuku) . 
"
12859776,2,54,"`` You can be a hero . ''
