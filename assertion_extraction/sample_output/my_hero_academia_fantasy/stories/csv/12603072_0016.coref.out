12603072,16,1,"Are you sure about this ? 
"
12603072,16,2,"I ve never been more sure . 
"
12603072,16,3,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked to the page with extreme confusion and concern when he ($_bakugou) suddenly came back and asked if he ($_bakugou) could meet Leviathan ($_leviathan) . This meeting was something he ($_bakugou) planned to do after he ($_bakugou) proposed to Izuku if he ($_bakugou) were to ever say yes to the engagement . 
"
12603072,16,4,"But now? 
"
12603072,16,5,"Asking for this meeting so suddenly could lead to two possible conclusions : something happened to Izuku while he ($_bakugou) was out and the_king ($_bakugou) was unaware of the happenings , or it was just Izuku ($_izuku) s curiosity getting the better of him ($_bakugou) again . Which is to say , Bakugou ($_bakugou) chose the ladder , since he ($_bakugou) did remember mentioning Leviathan ($_leviathan) a couple times while in Izuku ($_izuku) s presence . But Izuku ($_izuku) knowing about Leviathan ($_leviathan) wasn t the issue . The issue was the fact that Leviathan ($_leviathan) will be meeting another human being besides Bakugou ($_bakugou) for the first time in decades . Considering his ($_bakugou) history , it s possible that the result of seeing Izuku ($_izuku) could end badly . 
"
12603072,16,6,"Though there were other exceptions besides Bakugou ($_bakugou) that had been taken in over the years , he ($_bakugou) knew that Leviathan ($_leviathan) won t be turning the other way this time , since he ($_bakugou) was a full blooded human . If anything , it s going to take a vast amount of convincing to let Izuku ($_izuku) stay and become apart of the dragons . 
"
12603072,16,7,"If the eldest dragon were to ever reject Izuku , then it ll be difficult for the two to marry , and Izuku ($_izuku) would have no choice but to go back home , where Todoroki ($_todoroki) ruled over . 
"
12603072,16,8,"After all , Leviathan ($_leviathan) was the true guardian of all dragons . Everything the dragons had built was all done by the guidance of the teal creature , and all sorts of control and decisions rested on the dragon s back . Which is why Bakugou ($_bakugou) had brought his ($_bakugou) dagger with him ($_bakugou) in case Leviathan ($_leviathan) was around the nesting area when he ($_bakugou) took Izuku ($_izuku) out to see the whelps and fledglings . His ($_bakugou) home was very close to the mothers and the children in case something happened to Yurick under any circumstances , and was even close to the other dragons homes should any human dare to attack . 
"
12603072,16,9,"It did make the king worry about Leviathan ($_leviathan) s thoughts on Izuku ($_izuku) , and was now very sure about bringing his dagger with him this time . Since he ll be taking Izuku ($_izuku) straight to where the grand king lives . 
"
12603072,16,10,"Of course , Bakugou ($_bakugou) knew this day was coming , but he ($_bakugou) wasn t expecting it so soon and completely ahead of time . 
"
12603072,16,11,"Alright , the blonde said , quickly holding up a finger once he ($_bakugou) saw Izuku ($_izuku) about ready to book it to the door . However , you need to stay by my side at all times . Do not wander , do not speak unless spoken to , and do not talk back or make any rash comments . Also , you need to submit as soon as you see Leviathan ($_leviathan) . That old geezer is not a dragon you should ever fuck with . Do you understand ? 
"
12603072,16,12,"Izuku ($_izuku) was taken aback by Bakugou s tone suddenly turning into one of seriousness . With the way he ($_izuku) enforced rules , it really brought a sense of fear to him ($_izuku) , and it made him ($_izuku) question if now was really a good time to be meeting Leviathan ($_leviathan) . But then he ($_izuku) remembered Todoroki ($_todoroki) s proposal , and how his ($_izuku) ignorance was what gave him ($_izuku) the answer to a complicated question he ($_izuku) had been contemplating on for a while . Yes , he ($_izuku) was shaken , shaken down to the core of seeing this all mighty dragon in all of his ($_izuku) glory . But this was a decision he ($_izuku) chose for himself ($_izuku) , in hopes to prove himself ($_izuku) to Bakugou , whom he ($_izuku) now holds romantic feelings for . This dragon they were about to meet was the real deal , and if he ($_izuku) wants his ($_izuku) head to remain on his ($_izuku) shoulders , he ($_izuku) better follow along with Bakugou ($_bakugou) s instructions . 
"
12603072,16,13,"Yes. . 
"
12603072,16,14,"Alright . I m calling Theia ($_theia) . 
"
12603072,16,15,"Izuku ($_izuku) was about to cover his ($_izuku) ears for the impending sound of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s scream , but was stopped . 
"
12603072,16,16,"You don t have to cover your ears this time . 
"
12603072,16,17,"Oh...uh...okay??????
"
12603072,16,18,"The_king ($_bakugou) s red eyes glanced down and found there were leaves that were scattered beneath his ($_bakugou) feet . While they were plentiful healthy in their green color , he ($_bakugou) had to choose one rather carefully , for they had to be in mint condition or it wouldn t work . He ($_bakugou) inspected them closely , looking each one over , before finally choosing one and pressing the leaf to his ($_bakugou) lips . The wind that drifted through his ($_bakugou) being relaxed his ($_bakugou) body , and the sound of the leaves rustling gave him ($_bakugou) the rhythm he ($_bakugou) need to let his ($_bakugou) lips create beautiful sounds from the leaf alone . It left Izuku ($_izuku) in a state of shock at how Bakugou ($_bakugou) could create such a beautiful tone from just a single leaf , and felt his ($_bakugou) cheeks grow rosy at the sight before him ($_bakugou) . 
"
12603072,16,19,"It was beautiful sight indeed . 
"
12603072,16,20,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked as if he ($_bakugou) was at peace , and the wind picked up his ($_bakugou) tattered mantel that heavily matched the red in his ($_bakugou) eyes that stared over the red orange horizon of the impending sunset . 
"
12603072,16,21,"He ($_bakugou) didn t stop the little song , nor did he ($_bakugou) notice the way Izuku stared at him ($_bakugou) as he ($_bakugou) played . To the page , it felt as if Bakugou ($_bakugou) had manifested into reality from his ($_bakugou) reoccurring dream . Every detail of the beautiful red , and the sharp shape of his ($_bakugou) eyes as he ($_bakugou) gazed over the horizon , and the naturally spiky blonde hair . While Izuku ($_izuku) thought Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked handsome before , he ($_bakugou) now found that he ($_bakugou) was beautiful ... very beautiful ... and it made his ($_bakugou) heart race in both embarrassment and worry . 
"
12603072,16,22,"A part of him ($_bakugou) grew worried ; wondering if he ($_bakugou) truly held romantic feelings for him ($_bakugou) for the man he ($_bakugou) was , or because of his ($_bakugou) outer beauty without paying any sort of stricken attention to his ($_bakugou) inner self . 
"
12603072,16,23,"He ($_bakugou) hoped the other possible outcome was not the case , for he ($_bakugou) would end up becoming like the others if that were true . 
"
12603072,16,24,"Nowadays , it was all about the person on the outer shell , but never the inside of them . It was like sense of morals had completely faded , and had been replaced with an insatiable greed for something . On few occasions , he ($_bakugou) would walk into his ($_bakugou) church , and hear the words of prayer from the other villagers . 
"
12603072,16,25,"Some would ask for wealth , a small minority would ask for fame , and he ($_bakugou) would count the number of crusaders who would ask God for glory . 
"
12603072,16,26,"Thinking about it now , it disgusted him ($_bakugou) how his ($_bakugou) people would ask so much out of God , as if they deserved to be blessed . 
"
12603072,16,27,"Yet he ($_bakugou) would always hope the prayers were answered , for those who were less fortunate . 
"
12603072,16,28,"Soon , Bakugou ($_bakugou) had finished his ($_bakugou) song , and looked over towards the doe eyed page , a grin slowly forming on his ($_bakugou) lips . 
"
12603072,16,29,"What? Never heard a leaf flute before ? 
"
12603072,16,30,"A leaf flute . . ? 
"
12603072,16,31,"Yeah , leaf flutes are usually something you see kids would try to play with when fresh leaves are scattered everywhere . But this sort of thing is more like a call for Theia ($_theia) to come . She ($_deathfire) kinda likes the sound of music , so I used to practice playing a tune as a call for her ($_deathfire) all the time until I finally got a tune she ($_deathfire) liked . 
"
12603072,16,32,"Izuku ($_izuku) slowly grew a little smile at the compassion Bakugou ($_bakugou) would always show for his ($_izuku) dragons . It must ve taken him ($_izuku) years to memorize every name , every personality , every color , and what they personally enjoyed . With Deathfire ($_deathfire) , she ($_deathfire) just loved to baby the_king ($_bakugou) , for Yurick , it was as if a trust bond had formed between them , and for Theia ($_theia) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) used her ($_bakugou) love for music as a way to call for her ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) truly was an amazing king , and Izuku ($_izuku) was becoming more sure that his ($_bakugou) feelings manifested into one of purity . 
"
12603072,16,33,"That s. . . amazing Izuku slowly said , standing next to the male and smiling over at him ($_bakugou) . You have such an amazing bond with all of these dragons ... it s. . . incredible??????
"
12603072,16,34,"They both stared in silence for a moment , before mutually looking away from one another ; cheeks flushed and hearts beating hard in their chests . Perhaps this is what most fanfiction writers would call : mutual pining . 
"
12603072,16,35,"By the very frail yet loud call of an incoming dragon , Izuku ($_izuku) stared in amazement at how beautiful this dragon was . Theia ($_theia) was a white dragon , with shimmering blue eyes and scales almost the shape of feathers around her ($_deku) neck , body and wings . No such horns on her ($_deku) head as opposed to the other dragons Izuku ($_izuku) had seen thus far , and her ($_deku) teeth were not as sharp as the others . She ($_deku) also looked fairly young , seeming to not have an abundance of prominent wrinkles or scales on her ($_deku) form . With one look , Bakugou ($_bakugou) instantly got the sign that Izuku ($_izuku) wanted some information in regards to Theia . 
"
12603072,16,36,"Deku ($_deku) , this is Theia ($_theia) , she ($_deku) just recently earned her ($_deku) name in the naming ceremony and is an herbivore fairy dragon . . 
"
12603072,16,37,"Wow???. I didn t know herbivorous dragons exist . . 
"
12603072,16,38,"Oh yeah , Bakugou ($_bakugou) said with a tiny grin . Years ago , it was said that a_dragon ($_the) found disgust in flesh and blood , and enjoyed eating plants . Though , that s the basic summary of what I was told . And yes , we also have omnivorous dragons as well . 
"
12603072,16,39,"This information was what amazed Izuku ($_izuku) the most . Growing up , he used to be scared of dragons , even had nightmares of them , but after three months of seeing them up close and personal , and learning all sorts of species , he was no longer scared of these feared creatures . If anything , he was invested , and always excited to learn more . Finding out that such dragons exist , brought a hope that dragons and humans can in fact find a peaceful way to co-exist . The difficult part of it all though , was humanity s way of thinking towards them , and it would be very troublesome to try to convince them that dragons were not as dangerous as many have claimed . Maybe he should start keeping a journal on the dragons to keep up with the species and take note of each and every one that he meets . 
"
12603072,16,40,"That s incredible ! 
"
12603072,16,41,"Theia ($_theia) looked over to Izuku curiously , her head tilted to the side as her throat rumbled a little shrill croon . It ($_theia) made Izuku ($_izuku) giggle at the adorable sight before him , and he couldn t help but walk over and give a small pet to her muzzle . 
"
12603072,16,42,"Hi there Theia He said in a soft voice , earning a much happier croon and a little nuzzle to his chest before her flat , pink tongue skimmed upon his cheek . 
"
12603072,16,43,"Seems like Theia ($_theia) likes you ... then again , she likes everyone .

"
12603072,16,46,"The trip to the grand king was silent , and both males knew why . 
"
12603072,16,47,"This was going to be a meeting that determined the future for both of them , and wordlessly , they didn t want to be separated like this . Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t want to lose Izuku ($_izuku) , and Izuku ($_izuku) didn t want to go back to the world full of cruelty and ignorance . Neither of them knew their inner thoughts , yet they held hopes that the other felt the same way . 
"
12603072,16,48,"During the silent ride , Bakugou ($_bakugou) soon came to a decision that he ($_bakugou) would rather be banished from the home of the dragons than let Izuku ($_izuku) go so easily .

12603072,16,51,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) remained silent , only letting the feeling of Izuku ($_izuku) s cheek resting on his ($_izuku) back and his ($_izuku) hands wrapping themselves a little tighter around his ($_izuku) waist .

12603072,16,53,"Izuku ($_izuku) looked up at Bakugou ($_bakugou) , shocked of the information , since he ($_izuku) remembered being told that Leviathan ($_leviathan) was a dragon to never mess with . Yet somehow , Leviathan ($_leviathan) once had a rider ? A human he ($_izuku) once trusted ? 
"
12603072,16,54,"A long time ago , Leviathan ($_leviathan) once trusted a human , and the first human he ($_izuku) trusted , was my ($_leviathan) my_great_grandfather ($_izuku) .

Neither left each other s side . They fought together , raised the dragon civilization from its ashes , and my ($_leviathan) my_great_grandfather ($_izuku) , was the first man to ever form a bond with an actual dragon within our dragonborn family line . He ($_izuku) even taught Leviathan ($_leviathan) how to speak telepathically , whether dragonborn or not , though it ($_leviathan) was mostly due to the stone he ($_izuku) had the_dragon ($_the) swallow to be able to do so , for he ($_izuku) was also a bit invested in alchemy .

"

"
12603072,16,58,"The great war ? 
"
12603072,16,59,"It was a war between humans and dragons . Nobody knows exactly how it started , but many believed that people grew greedy for more land , and during that war , a human killed my_great_grandfather ($_izuku) .

They all retreated to where they are now , and allowed the humans to win the amount of land they wanted out of his ($_leviathan) own grief .

"
12603072,16,62,"What about your other dragonborn family ? 
"
12603072,16,63,"That s the thing . There used to be a lot of us , but we quickly diminished over the course of time , until it was just my great grandfather and great grandmother , my grandparents who later had my mother , and another small dragonborn family with just my father and his parents . This was mainly due to the amount of miscarriages that happened , or breathing for 10 seconds before passing away right after birth . .

"
12603072,16,65,"Our bloodline might ve been the most powerful for anyone to have , but that was the problem . Sometimes it would be too powerful for anyone to handle , and often times a child would pass away around the ages of infantry to 5 years old for being unable to handle the power they possess . Some were born lucky ... others ... not so much . they were born as weak vessels to the power that was passed down to them , which made it difficult for our dragonborn family line to continue .

12603072,16,98,"The silence killed the king , and his mind raced with what Leviathan ($_leviathan) could be thinking about at this very moment . 
"
12603072,16,99,"If he ever tried to kill him , then there will be some teeth crossing with a dagger . He promised himself that he would protect Izuku ($_izuku) from this dragon , and even told himself that he would much rather abandon his life of dragons than lose Izuku ($_izuku) and wait another 10 years . 
"
12603072,16,100,"In the midst of the silence , Izuku ($_izuku) looked over Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulder when his ears picked up the sounds of squeaks and tiny croons . He grew excited when he found fledglings playing around near Leviathan ($_leviathan) with Theia ($_theia) keeping a close eye on them . In an instant of a quick comparison , he found that the fledglings belonged to Theia and Leviathan ($_leviathan) , and he couldn t help but grow a fond smile at the way they excitedly played without much of a care of what was happening around them . His mind had turned off when he slowly moved from his spot and started making his way towards the playing little dragons , and he just wanted to at least come to terms with them as maybe a way to prove to the grand king that he meant no harm . 
"
12603072,16,101,"DEKU ! Bakugu shouted , quickly rushing to Izuku once Leviathan ($_leviathan) s growl got louder and he zoomed in on the page . 
"
12603072,16,102,"Izuku ($_izuku) could only freeze as everything had happened too fast for him to process . Within a split second , Bakugou ($_bakugou) had stood in front of him , one hand held behind him towards the page as a way to keep him back behind him , with the other hand pointing his dragon toothed dagger towards Leviathan ($_leviathan) who had closed in very close to Izuku ($_izuku) with the intention to kill . If Bakugou ($_bakugou) was a hair too late , the dragon would ve surely killed him , and that thought alone pissed him off to no end . 
"
12603072,16,103,"He told Izuku ($_izuku) to not act on his own , to stay by his side at all times , to not speak unless spoken to , and to fully submit to Leviathan . But his stupid actions almost got him killed , and knowing that terrified him . 
"
12603072,16,104,"Both dragon and dragonborn stared at each other in very silent , yet hard glares . Leviathan ($_leviathan) s were cold , while Bakugou ($_bakugou) s held a promise of killing the creature if he so much as lay a single tooth on him . 
"
12603072,16,105,"With a little glance , Izuku ($_izuku) could see the fledglings had taken notice of what was going on and went straight to their mama for comfort . Hearing their father s growling roar certainly scared them and Izuku ($_izuku) could see their fear in their whimpers and shaking bodies that they tried to hide in the soft belly of Theia ($_theia) . 
"
12603072,16,106,"He messed up . 
"
12603072,16,107,"He knew he did . 
"
12603072,16,108,"He messed up his chances of gaining Leviathan ($_leviathan) s trust , along with the very acceptance of staying here and living with the dragons and Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
"
12603072,16,109,"The movements were very slow , but Leviathan ($_leviathan) soon started to silently back off along with Bakugou ($_bakugou) mutually proceeding to back off as well . Bakugou ($_bakugou) slowly placed his ($_bakugou) dagger back into it s fitting scabbard before speaking in a low voice . 
"
12603072,16,110,"Deku ($_deku) ... get on Theia ($_theia) ... we re finished here so it ($_deku) would seem . 
"
12603072,16,111,"But-???
"
12603072,16,112,"Do as your told !! 
"
12603072,16,113,"Izuku ($_izuku) flinched at the king suddenly raising his ($_izuku) voice , yet he ($_izuku) did as he ($_izuku) was asked , slowly climbing onto Theia ($_theia) s back who was ready to take both the king and the page back to Bakugou s home ; her ($_izuku) muzzle gently nuzzling against her ($_izuku) young to reassure them that everything was alright . 
"
12603072,16,114,"The ride back home was long and silent . 
"
12603072,16,115,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) was too pissed to say anything , and Izuku ($_izuku) was too scared to start up a conversation . 
"
12603072,16,116,"The air around them was warm , but both of them were shaking from the left over adrenaline and fear they felt back in Leviathan ($_leviathan) s watering hole . 
"
12603072,16,117,"Izuku ($_izuku) tried everything he ($_izuku) could to say something , but everytime he ($_izuku) would open his ($_izuku) mouth , no words could come out . 
"
12603072,16,118,"What ... in the hell were you thinking . ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked , trying to keep his ($_bakugou) anger contained , but it was becoming more and more difficult to do so knowing what could ve happened if he ($_bakugou) didn t step in . 
"
12603072,16,119,"Izuku ($_izuku) was afraid to answer that question , knowing he ($_bakugou) wasn t really thinking when he ($_bakugou) decided to pull that stunt towards Leviathan ($_leviathan) s children , but even then , deep down in his ($_bakugou) thought process , he ($_bakugou) truly thought that kindling with the fledglings would show that he ($_bakugou) meant no harm towards the dragons the grand king would watch over .

12603072,16,122,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) hated how he ($_bakugou) made Izuku ($_izuku) flinch by his ($_bakugou) sudden shouting . But dammit , he ($_bakugou) was so damn angry that he ($_bakugou) could no longer contain it .

12603072,16,129,"Why was Izuku ($_izuku) talking back like this ? This was something he ($_izuku) didn t want to argue about , but dammit he ($_izuku) was so frustrated and pissed , that he ($_izuku) just couldn t contain it at all . Even if he ($_izuku) were to speak out his ($_izuku) frustrations like this , Izuku ($_izuku) wouldn t be able to understand .

Even the birthmothers loved him ($_bakugou) . So then why???. why would he ($_bakugou) tell such a lie ? Why would he ($_bakugou) hurt Izuku like this ? Was it just to win the argument ?
