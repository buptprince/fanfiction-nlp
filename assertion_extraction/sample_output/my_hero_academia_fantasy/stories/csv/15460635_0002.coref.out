15460635,2,1,"When Bakugou ($_bakugou) cracked open his ($_bakugou) eyes the next morning , he ($_bakugou) was met with giant green orbs staring at him ($_bakugou) . 
"
15460635,2,2,"Ack ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) instinctively kicked at whatever was in front of him ($_bakugou) and scooted away on his ($_bakugou) fur pelts . 
"
15460635,2,3,"It was only after he ($_bakugou) kicked whatever it was that there came a cry of pain and Bakugou ($_bakugou) realized that it was Deku ($_deku) who was staring at him ($_bakugou) . 
"
15460635,2,4,"What the hell , Deku ($_deku) !? Bakugou ($_bakugou) exclaimed while watching the green-haired boy on the ground clutching at his ($_bakugou) nose . 
"
15460635,2,5,"I-I m sorry ! 
"
15460635,2,6,"The blond let out a sigh of annoyance and relaxed his ($_bakugou) muscles . Crawling over to where Deku ($_deku) was curled on the floor , he ($_bakugou) turned him ($_deku) over only to see bright red blood . 
"
15460635,2,7,"Dammit , you re bleeding . 
"
15460635,2,8,"Deku ($_deku) reached up to dab at the blood dripping down from his ($_deku) nose and then inspected it . 
"
15460635,2,9,"Oh no , I m so sorry ! 
"
15460635,2,10,"The freckled boy immediately took out a handkerchief and began dabbing at his nose . That didn t do anything and so Bakugou ($_bakugou) stood up and started to leave the cave . 
"
15460635,2,11,"Where are you going ? Deku ($_deku) asked . 
"
15460635,2,12,"Wait here , Bakugou ($_bakugou) answered while quickly walking out into the fresh morning . 
"
15460635,2,13,"It was chillier than usual and Bakugou ($_bakugou) wished he ($_bakugou) had grabbed his ($_bakugou) fur pelt to wear . There was a small stream nearby and with some incredible luck he ($_bakugou) found some ice since the temperatures had dropped unusually low the night before . Gathering the ice from the stream with his ($_bakugou) hands and putting it in a cloth , he ($_bakugou) made his ($_bakugou) way quickly back to the cave . 
"
15460635,2,14,"As soon as he ($_bakugou) reentered , he ($_bakugou) saw that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was awake and was looking with concern at Deku ($_deku) . At the sight of him ($_bakugou) again , Deku ($_deku) smiled and Kirishima ($_kirishima) simply gave him ($_bakugou) a disapproving look . 
"
15460635,2,15,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) , why did you ($_bakugou) kick Midoriya ? he ($_bakugou) asked . 
"
15460635,2,16,"The blond rolled his ($_bakugou) eyes and walked over , making sure the red-head moved out of his ($_bakugou) way . 
"
15460635,2,17,"As he ($_bakugou) knelt beside Deku ($_deku) whose handkerchief was almost covered in blood , he ($_bakugou) responded , I didn t do it on purpose . If this idiot wasn t staring at me when I woke up I wouldn t have kicked him ($_bakugou) . It s his ($_bakugou) fault , honestly . 
"
15460635,2,18,"I said I m sorry ! Deku ($_deku) said sadly . 
"
15460635,2,19,"Letting out a sigh , Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed Deku ($_deku) s chin with his ($_bakugou) fingers causing the green-haired boy to go quiet immediately . Silence fell between them as the blond forced Deku ($_deku) s to lean forward slightly and face downwards slightly . He ($_bakugou) then proceeded to pinch Deku ($_deku) s nostrils together with his ($_bakugou) thumb and forefinger and pressed against the freckled boy s face . 
"
15460635,2,20,"They sat like this for five minutes or so and then when Bakugou ($_bakugou) let go , the blood had seemed to stop . Deku ($_deku) blinked and reached up to gingerly touch his ($_deku) sore nose . 
"
15460635,2,21,"You got it to stop ! he ($_deku) said happily . 
"
15460635,2,22,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) nodded and then shoved the ice he ($_deku) gathered into Deku ($_deku) s hands . 
"
15460635,2,23,"Here , put this ice on your nose . It ll help prevent bruising and keep the nosebleed from coming back . 
"
15460635,2,24,"The blond made sure to avoid looking at Deku ($_deku) when doing this and stood up . He ($_deku) brushed past Kirishima who looked dumbfounded and grabbed his ($_deku) spear that was leaning against the wall of the cave . Slipping on his ($_deku) fur cloak , he ($_deku) left without a word to go hunting . 
"
15460635,2,25,"Hey wait! Kacchan ! 
"
15460635,2,26,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) paused once outside the cave and saw Deku ($_deku) jogging after him ($_deku) , ice still held up to his ($_deku) nose . 
"
15460635,2,27,"What the hell are you doing , idiot ? Go back to the cave and rest ; I don t want to have to stop the bleeding again . 
"
15460635,2,28,"Deku ($_deku) frowned and clutched at the satchel he ($_deku) had across his ($_deku) torso . Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned and continued to walk and he ($_deku) let out a groan of frustration as he ($_deku) heard soft footsteps in pursuit behind him ($_deku) . Choosing to ignore the boy that followed him ($_deku) , he ($_deku) made his ($_deku) way hiking towards the river which held all of the trout and salmon . 
"
15460635,2,29,"As they made their journey , Deku ($_deku) eventually ditched the ice bag since the swelling was non-existent and his ($_deku) nose was only slightly bruised . Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned his ($_bakugou) head to peer over his ($_bakugou) shoulder and saw those hypnotic green eyes watching him ($_bakugou) endearingly . Almost as soon as he ($_bakugou) looked , he ($_bakugou) turned away to face forward again , hastening his ($_bakugou) pace . 
"
15460635,2,30,"He ($_bakugou) could hear Deku ($_deku) panting slightly behind him ($_bakugou) , trying to keep up . 
"
15460635,2,31,"You sure know your way around this forest ! 
"
15460635,2,32,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) responded , I ($_bakugou) ve lived here long enough to know my ($_bakugou) way . 
"
15460635,2,33,"How long have you lived here ? Judging by how well you get around I d say you ve been here for a while . Not to mention you have proper knowledge on medicine and how to treat injuries . You must ve been injured a lot in the past . Living in the forest must be rough , huh ? I ($_bakugou) don t know if I ($_bakugou) could do it all by myself ($_bakugou) but at least you have a frie - 
"
15460635,2,34,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) had had enough of this muttering nonsense and cut him ($_bakugou) off . 
"
15460635,2,35,"You re talking too much . 
"
15460635,2,36,"Deku ($_deku) blushed and looked away . 
"
15460635,2,37,"My ($_bakugou) friends at the village always say that , he mumbled . 
"
15460635,2,38,"You have friends ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked teasingly . 
"
15460635,2,39,"This got the green-haired boy to clench his hands into fists and walk faster , now keeping pace with Bakugou to walk side by side . 
"
15460635,2,40,"I ($_bakugou) ll have you know I ($_bakugou) have plenty of friends ! 
"
15460635,2,41,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped in his ($_bakugou) tracks and Deku ($_deku) was now slightly ahead of him ($_bakugou) . The boy had turned around to look at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . The blond was looking at him ($_bakugou) with a raised eyebrow at the defiant look on Deku ($_deku) s face . It was he ($_bakugou) hated to admit it cute . 
"
15460635,2,42,"So why leave them ? 
"
15460635,2,43,"Deku ($_deku) s eyes fell to the ground between them and he ($_bakugou) shuffled his ($_bakugou) feet in the dirt . 
"
15460635,2,44,"That s not important he ($_bakugou) said quietly . 
"
15460635,2,45,"Red eyes narrowed for a moment and then Bakugou ($_bakugou) walked forward , nudging Deku ($_deku) slightly out of his ($_deku) way . They resumed their hike through the woods . When they finally reached the river , Deku ($_deku) let out a soft wow at the sight of how large it was . They were standing at the edge of rapids and hundreds of fish were splashing in the water while swimming against the current . 
"
15460635,2,46,"Before Deku ($_deku) could say a word , Bakugou ($_bakugou) leapt off the edge where they were standing and was jumping across rocks to have easier access at the fish . Deku ($_deku) simply sat down on a nearby boulder and watched as the blond waited patiently above the water , his ($_deku) spear poised and ready . Bakugou ($_bakugou) glanced up from where he ($_deku) was to see Deku ($_deku) watching him ($_deku) and decided to try and show off by stabbing not just two , but three decently sized salmon in the water . Deku ($_deku) cheered as the blond made his ($_deku) way across the rocks towards the edge , he ($_deku) was smiling cockily at himself ($_deku) for such an amazing catch . 
"
15460635,2,47,"The last rock for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to jump on ended up being much more slippery than he ($_deku) had determined and with a sharp intake of breath , he ($_deku) felt his ($_deku) feet be swept away with the rough current . 
"
15460635,2,48,"The world went black for a brief moment as Bakugou ($_bakugou) almost lost consciousness from going under the water and his ($_bakugou) head hitting a rock . Breaking free on the surface , Bakugou ($_bakugou) gasped for air as he ($_bakugou) went incredibly fast down the current . His ($_bakugou) arms were flailing around for something to grab onto , anything . His ($_bakugou) spear with the fish he ($_bakugou) had caught was long gone but he ($_bakugou) could care less about that . Right now he ($_bakugou) needed to focus on surviving . 
"
15460635,2,49,"Kacchan ! 
"
15460635,2,50,"He ($_bakugou) heard Deku ($_deku) s frantic cry but couldn t see where the green-haired boy was . His ($_bakugou) sense of direction was off from his ($_bakugou) head spinning after hitting it . 
"
15460635,2,51,"Maybe it was simply his ($_bakugou) lucky day but he ($_bakugou) looked over at the edge of the river and there was a large tree branch extended out . Reaching out a hand while trying to stay above the water , the blond grabbed onto the branch with all of his ($_bakugou) strength and held on tightly . Something , he ($_bakugou) didn t know what , was pulling him ($_bakugou) up out of the river using the branch . 
"
15460635,2,52,"Red eyes blinked open and despite his ($_bakugou) vision going in and out of focus , he ($_bakugou) saw those vivid green eyes on the other end of the branch . 
"
15460635,2,53,"Deku ($_deku) ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked in confusion . 
"
15460635,2,54,"His ($_bakugou) body finally made it on dry land and Bakugou ($_bakugou) was on all fours , trying to catch his ($_bakugou) breath and not throw up . As strong as he ($_bakugou) was , he ($_bakugou) had hit his ($_bakugou) head pretty badly and it was causing his ($_bakugou) vision to go blurry . He ($_bakugou) felt a smaller , warmer body grab onto his ($_bakugou) arm and hoist him ($_bakugou) up to his ($_bakugou) feet . For a minute , he ($_bakugou) tried to fight those arms off of him ($_bakugou) ; he ($_bakugou) didn t want anyone to help him ($_bakugou) . But when he ($_bakugou) stumbled back down to his ($_bakugou) hands and knees again , he ($_bakugou) decided he ($_bakugou) had no choice . He ($_bakugou) begrudgingly allowed himself ($_bakugou) to be helped by Deku ($_deku) . 
"
15460635,2,55,"This was the worst day of his ($_bakugou) life . 
"
15460635,2,56,"I ve got you ($_kacchan) , Kacchan ($_kacchan) ! Deku ($_deku) said while sounding out of breath . 
"
15460635,2,57,"Bakugou didn t know where they were going . 
"
15460635,2,58,"Deku ($_deku) where the fuck are we going ? the blond asked. 
"
15460635,2,59,"Deku ($_deku) laid Bakugou ($_bakugou) down against large roots of a tree and Bakugou ($_bakugou) watched as the green-haired boy ran off . 
"
15460635,2,60,"Stay there ! he ($_deku) called out . 
"
15460635,2,61,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) sighed , Where else the fuck would I ($_bakugou) go ? 
"
15460635,2,62,"When Deku ($_deku) returned , Bakugou ($_bakugou) saw that he ($_deku) had some sort of plant with him ($_deku) . It looked like he ($_deku) had a handful of flowers . 
"
15460635,2,63,"- the hell is that ? he ($_deku) asked , trying to get up . Did you ($_kacchan) seriously bring me ($_bakugou) flowers ? 
"
15460635,2,64,"Deku ($_deku) got down on his ($_deku) knees beside Bakugou ($_bakugou) and placed a hand on the blond s shoulder to keep him ($_deku) from getting up . A small smile appeared on Deku ($_deku) s lips as he ($_deku) picked off the leaves of the flowers . 
"
15460635,2,65,"This is Feverfew , it s a common medicinal herb to treat pain , headaches , nausea , and basically it is a miracle herb ! 
"
15460635,2,66,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) furrowed his ($_bakugou) brows in confusion as Deku ($_deku) then proceeded to held a few leaves to Bakugou s mouth . Red eyes glared at the leaves trying to be forced into his ($_bakugou) mouth and then at Deku ($_deku) s insistent face . He ($_bakugou) then raised a hand and batted away the leaves . 
"
15460635,2,67,"You ($_kacchan) expect me ($_bakugou) to just eat some plant ? How do I ($_bakugou) know you ($_kacchan) re not trying to poison me ($_bakugou) and kill me ($_bakugou) ? he ($_bakugou) said gruffly . 
"
15460635,2,68,"Deku ($_deku) rolled his ($_deku) eyes and urged the leaves at the blond once more . 
"
15460635,2,69,"I ($_bakugou) promise you ($_kacchan) , I m not poisoning you ($_kacchan) , Kacchan . I ($_bakugou) m trying to help you ($_kacchan) . 
"
15460635,2,70,"The blond glared at Deku ($_deku) . Fine , if it s not poisonous , then you ($_kacchan) eat it first . 
"
15460635,2,71,"Deku ($_deku) gave an angry look and ripped off a leaf from the plant . He ($_deku) ate it quickly and swallowed before shrugging his ($_deku) shoulders at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s skeptical face . 
"
15460635,2,72,"See? It s not poisonous . 
"
15460635,2,73,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) stared for another minute and then grabbed a handful of the herbs and tossed it in his ($_bakugou) mouth . As soon as the taste hit his ($_bakugou) taste buds he ($_bakugou) immediately spat it out . 
"
15460635,2,74,"What the fuck !? he ($_bakugou) yelled . This tastes like shit ! 
"
15460635,2,75,"Deku ($_deku) chuckled and said , Well you ($_kacchan) can t expect medicine to actually taste good . 
"
15460635,2,76,"Red eyes were full of anger as Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed another handful of herbs and ate them begrudgingly . He ($_bakugou) chewed quickly , trying not to taste and then swallowed , grimacing the entire time . 
"
15460635,2,77,"This action seemed to ease Deku ($_deku) s anxiety because his ($_bakugou) shoulders relaxed immediately . He ($_bakugou) reached into his ($_bakugou) satchel that he ($_bakugou) carried and took out a roll of what looked like white cloth . 
"
15460635,2,78,"What are you doing ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked . 
"
15460635,2,79,"You ve got a nasty cut on the right side of your head that needs to be bandaged . 
"
15460635,2,80,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) immediately reached up to feel and his ($_bakugou) fingers met a warm , sticky sensation . When he ($_bakugou) looked at his ($_bakugou) hand , there was blood . It didn t seem too serious but still , he ($_bakugou) was bleeding . Head trauma was not something to take lightly . 
"
15460635,2,81,"The blond s thoughts were soon interrupted when Deku ($_deku) cupped his ($_deku) hand on his ($_deku) face and lifted him ($_deku) up so red eyes could meet green . His ($_deku) mind went blank and he ($_deku) couldn t think of anything for a long minute . 
"
15460635,2,82,"What are you - ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) began to ask but Deku ($_deku) seemed concentrated on looking into the blond s eyes . 
"
15460635,2,83,"They simply stared at each other ; a very faint blush began to color the blond s cheeks . Then Deku ($_deku) released Bakugou ($_bakugou) s face and let out a sigh of relief . 
"
15460635,2,84,"Well thankfully you don t seem to have a concussion . 
"
15460635,2,85,"Of course I don t , idiot . Bakugou ($_bakugou) muttered . 
"
15460635,2,86,"After that , Deku ($_deku) began to bandage up Bakugou ($_bakugou) s head wound . Deku ($_deku) had used another random herb to apparently disinfect the wound but Bakugou ($_bakugou) couldn t remember the name . When finished with everything , Deku ($_deku) replaced his ($_deku) items back in his ($_deku) bag along with some extra feverfew leaves . 
"
15460635,2,87,"So , how do we get back to the cave from here ? Deku ($_deku) asked . 
"
15460635,2,88,"He ($_deku) looked over and paused when he ($_deku) saw that Bakugou ($_bakugou) was asleep . Deciding it was best that they both rest , Deku ($_deku) sat down , leaning against the roots of the tree next to Bakugou . He ($_deku) let out a sigh and looked up at the tree branches above them , the afternoon sunlight filtered down through the leaves and Deku ($_deku) closed his ($_deku) eyes . 
"
15460635,2,89,"When Bakugou ($_bakugou) woke up , he ($_bakugou) had momentarily forgotten where he ($_bakugou) was . It ($_bakugou) wasn t his ($_bakugou) cave or anywhere he ($_bakugou) was familiar with . Not to mention the sky seemed to grow steadily darker and he ($_bakugou) realized that nightfall was approaching . He ($_bakugou) was about to get up when he ($_bakugou) heard a mumble of gibberish and he ($_bakugou) looked over to see that he ($_bakugou) had fallen asleep next to Deku . Carefully , he ($_bakugou) moved away from the green-haired boy while making sure not to wake him ($_bakugou) . As soon as he ($_bakugou) stood up , he ($_bakugou) felt slightly dizzy but it was more from sitting for too long than it was due to his ($_bakugou) head injury . The herbs that Deku ($_deku) had given him ($_bakugou) did wonders and he ($_bakugou) wasn t in any pain , nor was he ($_bakugou) feeling nauseated . 
"
15460635,2,90,"Red eyes looked with curiosity at the sleeping freckled-boy below him ($_bakugou) . A cool , evening breeze caused the trees above them to sway and Bakugou ($_bakugou) watched as those wild green locks of hair ruffled in the breeze . Green eyes slowly began to open and Deku ($_deku) jolted awake when he ($_deku) realized Bakugou ($_bakugou) wasn t next to him ($_deku) anymore . Alarm was quickly replaced with relief however when Deku ($_deku) looked up to see Bakugou ($_bakugou) staring down at him ($_deku) with a strange look . 
"
15460635,2,91,"Are you feeling better ? he ($_deku) asked followed by a yawn . 
"
15460635,2,92,"The blond nodded and tore his ($_deku) gaze away from that rather cute sheepish expression Deku had on his ($_deku) face . 
"
15460635,2,93,"Get up. We re going to head back to the cave . 
"
15460635,2,94,"Deku ($_deku) complied and quickly got up , brushing dirt off of his ($_deku) pants . He ($_deku) tossed his ($_deku) satchel over his ($_deku) shoulder and followed Bakugou who was able to find his ($_deku) way easily back to the pathway leading from the river to the cave . As they walked , the sky turned from a bright orange to a dark blue . 
"
15460635,2,95,"I hope Kirishima ($_kirishima) isn t too worried about us being gone for so long ! Deku ($_deku) said . 
"
15460635,2,96,"The blond rolled his eyes and replied , He s used to me not coming back for a while in order to get supplies . 
"
15460635,2,97,"What do you normally do every day ? 
"
15460635,2,98,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) shrugged and answered , I usually go hunting , gathering supplies needed to live . The red-headed idiot usually just sleeps because he ($_bakugou) s a lazy ass . 
"
15460635,2,99,"Deku ($_deku) laughed but then it became silent and Bakugou ($_bakugou) glanced back to see that freckled face wearing a rather serious expression . 
"
15460635,2,100,"What? he ($_bakugou) asked . 
"
15460635,2,101,"Green eyes looked up at him with sadness . Have you both always been on your own out here ? he ($_bakugou) asked . 
"
15460635,2,102,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked back to the front of him and hastened his pace slightly . Stop asking questions , he muttered . 
"
15460635,2,103,"No more questions came up after that and they finally reached the cave . Outside , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was found picking his ($_kirishima) teeth with a small animal bone . His ($_kirishima) red eyes looked up at their appearance and he ($_kirishima) grinned . 
"
15460635,2,104,"So , he ($_kirishima) began in a teasing tone . What were you two up to all day ? 
"
15460635,2,105,"His ($_kirishima) eyebrows rose high as he ($_kirishima) saw the bandages on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s head . 
"
15460635,2,106,"Oi , Bakugou , what s up with the bandages ? 
"
15460635,2,107,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) shot him ($_kirishima) a glare and simply walked past him ($_kirishima) ignoring him ($_kirishima) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) then looked at Deku ($_deku) questioningly . 
"
15460635,2,108,"Ah erm , Kacchan ($_kacchan) got into a bit of an accident in the river and I just helped treat his ($_kacchan) injury ! Deku ($_deku) said in an anxious voice . 
"
15460635,2,109,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) blinked and spoke slowly , Wait so let me get this straight . Bakugou ($_bakugou) hit his ($_bakugou) head and allowed you to bandage him ($_bakugou) up ? 
"
15460635,2,110,"Deku ($_deku) nodded and without warning , Kirishima ($_kirishima) burst out laughing in disbelief . Bakugou ($_bakugou) spun his ($_bakugou) heels and ran over to the red-head , hitting him ($_bakugou) in the back of the head . 
"
15460635,2,111,"HAHAHAHA-OW ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) rubbed the back of his ($_kirishima) head while wincing . What was that for ? 
"
15460635,2,112,"For being annoying. 
"
15460635,2,113,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) rolled his ($_kirishima) eyes and then Bakugou ($_bakugou) walked over to Deku . He ($_kirishima) held out a small pouch of nuts and berries and Deku ($_deku) took it , his ($_deku) face was confused . 
"
15460635,2,114,"This should last you for your trip back to your village , the blond said . 
"
15460635,2,115,"Deku ($_deku) frowned as Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned away and immediately began making his ($_deku) way towards the entrance of the cave . He ($_deku) only stopped when Kirishima ($_kirishima) spoke . 
"
15460635,2,116,"What the hell , Bakugou ($_bakugou) ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) complained . You mean to tell me that after this_guy ($_deku) saves your life , you re going to just send him ($_deku) away !? 
"
15460635,2,117,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) nodded . Yeah , got a problem with that ? 
"
15460635,2,118,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) stood up and walked over to Deku , nudging him ($_deku) forward with a hard pat on the back . 
"
15460635,2,119,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) saved your life ; don t you think you owe him ($_deku) ? 
"
15460635,2,120,"Bakugou grit his ($_deku) teeth in annoyance and anger at those words . He ($_deku) immediately resorted to yelling . 
"
15460635,2,121,"I don t owe anything to anyone ! 
"
15460635,2,122,"Deku ($_deku) bit his ($_deku) lip and looked down at the ground . Bakugou ($_bakugou) swallowed as he ($_bakugou) watched that freckled face turn to sadness . He ($_bakugou) looked away from it and folded his ($_bakugou) arms over his ($_bakugou) chest . 
"
15460635,2,123,"I told Deku ($_deku) he ($_bakugou) could only stay one night . That s passed now and he ($_bakugou) needs to leave . 
"
15460635,2,124,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) wasn t buying it ($_kirishima) . 
"
15460635,2,125,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) , if it ($_kirishima) wasn t for Midoriya ($_midoriya) , you probably would ve died . 
"
15460635,2,126,"There was a long period of silence and the crickets in the forest began to chirp loudly . The sun was almost entirely gone . 
"
15460635,2,127,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) finally let out a sigh and released his ($_bakugou) hands which were clenched tightly into fists . 
"
15460635,2,128,"Alright_,_Deku ($_deku) can stay a few more nights but that s it . God it s like I m dealing with children .
