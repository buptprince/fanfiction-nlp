"
12560580,5,2,"The first few moments between the two boys was filled with an awed sense of quiet . There was stillness in the air as the two only stared at one another ; for only a few fleeting seconds , it was only them . They took themselves in , carefully yet quickly . 
"
12560580,5,3,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked at the_prince ($_tenya) with wide eyes , captivated by him ($_katsuki) . The unruly mess of hair colored a green-laced ebony , eyes vivacious pools of emerald , and cheeks splattered with speckles of clay and then shaded with rose , so prominent against the stretch of cream that was his skin . The_prince_'s ($_tenya) eyes were so wide , so expressive ; even when he knew the reason was by his own fault , the boy could n't help finding awe in the easiness it was to see the_prince_'s ($_tenya) confusion . 
"
12560580,5,4,"He knew it was sudden , he knew he was basing it all on lack of experience and knowledge . All the Yousei did n't really stand out to him ; Ochako was pretty , but he never thought to much on it . The only other person he 'd seen the same size as him outside of the forest was Gougou , and the two looked identical ; all the other bigger people looked funny to him , and All Might terrified him . And yet , he still could n't shake this feeling this overwhelming conclusion within his own mind the prince standing before him was ... he was ... 
"
12560580,5,5,"He was the most beautiful person he had ever seen . # . "" ` cuse me ? Um... hello?"" 
"
12560580,5,6,"A soft noise left his lips as he shook his head . Centering his gaze , the boy looked back at the prince who , while still appearing very much startled , looked at him with slight concern . 
"
12560580,5,7,"Blinking a few times , he let out a quiet croak , face pink , `` Uh ... yeah ? '' 
"
12560580,5,8,"`` I. . . I asked ... who - who are you ? '' The_prince ($_tenya) stuttered out , eyes wide as a small hand barley covered over his ($_tenya) mouth . His ($_tenya) brows were pinched with worry for the situation . When Katsuki ($_katsuki) did n't answer immediately , he ($_tenya) simply shook his ($_tenya) head , leaning forward only by a hair , hand clenching into a fist , `` How did you get past the guards ? '' 
"
12560580,5,9,"`` I. . . uh ... '' He ($_tenya) let his ($_tenya) jaw fall slack as he ($_tenya) tried to form an answer that would satisfy the_troubled_prince ($_tenya) before him ($_tenya) . `` I ($_tenya) just ... snuck past them ... yeah ... '' 
"
12560580,5,10,"The_prince ($_tenya) only responded with a nervous scowl , eyes narrowing as he ($_tenya) slowly looked up and down the newfound intruder , trying to assess the danger . A small flicker of blue light caught his ($_tenya) eyes and the_prince ($_tenya) found himself ($_tenya) looking to the side of the boy and soon he ($_tenya) found himself ($_tenya) staring at a tiny blitz of light . 
"
12560580,5,11,"`` Um ... excuse me ... but , '' he ($_tenya) started tentatively , hand unclenching and reaching out to point at the ball of light by the boy 's head . `` I mean ... is that ... a fairy ? '' 
"
12560580,5,12,"Suddenly , the blue light surged at him ($_tenya) , stopping only a foot from his ($_tenya) face . The_prince ($_tenya) let out only a small gasp when it came near , but his ($_tenya) eyes widened with curiosity as the blue light began to dissipate . Within a matter of seconds , the blue light was gone and only a tiny boy with flittering wings was left in its place . 
"
12560580,5,13,"The small boy quickly slammed a hand against his own chest as he bowed his head , `` My name is Tenya Iida ! I am a blue fairy , one of the fastest and the rarest ! It is a pleasure to meet you , your Highness ! '' 
"
12560580,5,14,"`` Ah , '' the_prince_'s ($_tenya) cheeks deepened in color as he lowered his head at the fairy . `` Thank ... thank you , Tenya-san ... the feelings are mutual ... '' 
"
12560580,5,15,"`` Hey , Iida ! '' The intruder called out , voice suddenly more brazen . `` Come back here , you 're making him uncomfortable . '' 
"
12560580,5,16,"`` Wha ... no , no , '' the_prince ($_tenya) shook his ($_tenya) head as he ($_tenya) looked at the intruder . `` I ($_tenya) 'm fine , but now I ($_tenya) have to ask . '' 
"
12560580,5,17,"Shifting his ($_tenya) stance , Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked at him ($_tenya) with a pensive stare , `` What ? '' 
"
12560580,5,18,"`` Well , I ($_tenya) mean ... are you ... '' He ($_tenya) looked down , his ($_tenya) face was getting redder . `` Are you from the forest ? '' 
"
12560580,5,19,"He ($_tenya) nodded in response . 
"
12560580,5,20,"The_prince ($_tenya) then clasped his ($_tenya) hands together , his ($_tenya) eyes brightening at the knowledge , `` Then ... then ... you would n't happen to have the Spiritual Stone of the Forest , would you ? '' 
"
12560580,5,21,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) only tilted his ($_tenya) head in confusion , `` The what ? '' 
"
12560580,5,22,"`` Ah , of course , '' slamming a fist into his ($_tenya) other palm , the_prince ($_tenya) reiterated , `` You probably call it something else . It 's a bright green and glittering stone , embroidered with gold ... shaped like three leaves ... '' 
"
12560580,5,23,"The boy 's eyes widened , head leaning back , `` Oh , you mean the_Yousei_Emerald ($_the) ; yeah , I have it ($_the) . '' 
"
12560580,5,24,"A large smile broke out onto the_prince_'s ($_tenya) face , his ($_tenya) hands coming together in a quick clap , `` It 's just as I ($_tenya) thought ! '' 
"
12560580,5,25,"Eyes misting over in a kind of haze , the_prince ($_tenya) looked down as he ($_tenya) smiled , `` I ($_tenya) 'm sorry , it 's just ... I ($_tenya) had a dream ... been having them a lot lately , but this one was different . '' 
"
12560580,5,26,"`` A dream ... '' Katsuki ($_katsuki) murmured . 
"
12560580,5,27,"The_prince ($_tenya) hummed in response , brows suddenly pinching as he ($_tenya) recalled it ($_tenya) . 
"
12560580,5,28,"`` I had it last night ; woke me up quite early , I could n't fall back asleep . '' He ($_tenya) started , slowly looking up at the boy . `` In it , there were dark , foreboding storm clouds billowing over Yuuei ($_yuuei) ... '' 
"
12560580,5,29,"`` But suddenly , '' his ($_tenya) eyes brightened as he ($_tenya) stared at him ($_tenya) . `` A ray of light shot out of the forest , parting through the clouds , and it lit up the sky and land within its path ... The light turned into a boy , no bigger than myself , holding a green and glittering stone , followed by a fairy . '' 
"
12560580,5,30,"Eyes lowering , the_prince ($_tenya) let out a sigh , `` I knew that this was a sign , a prophecy that someone would come out of the forest ... and , well , I believe that the boy must be you ; the evidence does n't suggest otherwise . '' 
"
12560580,5,31,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) only nodded as he ($_katsuki) looked at the_prince ($_tenya) ; Tenya ($_tenya) remained perched by his ($_katsuki) side , listening dutifully . 
"
12560580,5,32,"`` Oh , '' the_prince ($_tenya) lifted a hand to his ($_tenya) mouth as his ($_tenya) eyes widened , cheeks filling back with rouge . `` I ($_tenya) 'm so sorry ! '' 
"
12560580,5,33,"Surprised by the sudden cry , the boy raised his arms up with a worried face , `` What 's the matter ? '' 
"
12560580,5,34,"The_prince ($_tenya) only shook his ($_tenya) head , his ($_tenya) freckles growing more prominent against the rose of his ($_tenya) cheeks , `` I ($_tenya) got carried away with my ($_tenya) questions and story ... I ($_tenya) did n't even properly introduce myself ($_tenya) ! '' 
"
12560580,5,35,"`` Ah ... '' 
"
12560580,5,36,"The_prince ($_tenya) merely gave his ($_tenya) body a small shake , and then straightened himself ($_tenya) accordingly , hands resting against his ($_tenya) front just below his ($_tenya) stomach . The change was not drastic , but suddenly Katsuki ($_katsuki) felt extremely out of place standing in front of the_prince ($_tenya) . He ($_katsuki) looked so calm , so important ... 
"
12560580,5,37,"so pretty...
"
12560580,5,38,"`` I ($_tenya) am Midoriya Izuku , Prince of Yuuei ($_yuuei) and heir to the throne of the Yuueian Kingdom . '' 
"
12560580,5,39,"Eyes snapping open , Katsuki ($_katsuki) shook himself ($_katsuki) out of his ($_katsuki) momentary stupor . He ($_katsuki) could feel Tenya_'s ($_tenya) eyes boring into his ($_katsuki) head because of his ($_katsuki) lapse in focus . 
"
12560580,5,40,"The prince , Midoriya ? Izuku ($_izuku) ? Izuku ($_izuku) ! Izuku ($_izuku) struck out his ($_izuku) hand and gestured to him ($_izuku) with a small smile gracing his ($_izuku) lips . 
"
12560580,5,41,"Why was he so cute ?! 
"
12560580,5,42,"`` And what is your ($_izuku) name ? '' 
"
12560580,5,43,"Stiffening , he ($_izuku) tried to bite out his ($_izuku) name , but for some reason , he ($_izuku) spoke like he ($_izuku) was five again . 
"
12560580,5,44,"`` It 's Ka-chuki Kats-chki KATSUKI ! '' 
"
12560580,5,45,"Izuku ($_izuku) only stared at him ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) felt his ($_izuku) face flush with red . 
"
12560580,5,46,"`` Katsuki ($_katsuki) ... '' 
"
12560580,5,47,"'' Yeah ... '' He ($_izuku) could n't look at him ($_izuku) after that little mess up . 
"
12560580,5,48,"`` That 's so strange ... '' He ($_izuku) looked up as he ($_izuku) heard the waver in the_prince_'s ($_tenya) voice . `` It 's so familiar ... and I. . . yes , I. . ."" 
"
12560580,5,49,"`` You what ? '' He ($_izuku) tilted his ($_izuku) head . 
"
12560580,5,50,"A soft smile broadened his ($_izuku) lips as he ($_izuku) looked back up at Katsuki ($_katsuki) , `` It 's just ... I ($_izuku) used to know a boy with the same name , but ... hah ... I ($_izuku) could never pronounce it when we were little I ($_izuku) would mess up like you did just now , so I ($_izuku) had my ($_izuku) own nickname for him ($_izuku) ... '' 
"
12560580,5,51,"Glancing around , the boy pursed his lips , `` Is my ($_izuku) name still hard to say , even now ? '' 
"
12560580,5,52,"`` Hmm , '' the_prince ($_tenya) looked at him with bright eyes . `` Well ... yeah ... it is kind of hard still ... '' 
"
12560580,5,53,"`` Then just use a nickname or something ; I ($_izuku) do n't ... really care ... yeah ... '' 
"
12560580,5,54,"Taking a step closer to him ($_izuku) , Izuku ($_izuku) asked , `` Are you ($_izuku) sure ? A nickname might be pretty childish ... '' 
"
12560580,5,55,"`` Well , we 're still kids ai n't we ? '' 
"
12560580,5,56,"`` Ah , '' straightening up , he ($_izuku) smiled . `` I ($_izuku) suppose you 're right . Besides , I ($_izuku) do n't think my ($_izuku) old friend would mind . He said he hated the name anyway ... '' 
"
12560580,5,57,"`` Well , I guess the name game is settled , '' Katsuki ($_katsuki) smirked . 
"
12560580,5,58,"`` I suppose you ($_kacchan) 're right , Kacchan ($_kacchan) . '' 
"
12560580,5,59,"`` Hah ! '' 
"
12560580,5,60,"A deep rose surged up on his neck , bloomed on his face , and burned his ears . He did n't know what to expect on the whole nickname thing , but ... why did it sound so cute coming from him ? 
"
12560580,5,61,"And so familiar, too...
"
12560580,5,62,"`` I told you the nickname was a little weird , '' Izuku ($_izuku) started , face turning away as a pink began to bloom on his ($_izuku) cheeks . 
"
12560580,5,63,"`` Tch , '' Katsuki ($_katsuki) only shook his ($_katsuki) head and looked away . `` It 's whatever ; I do n't care . '' 
"
12560580,5,64,"A soft giggle bubbled in the air and he ($_katsuki) whipped his ($_katsuki) head around to look at the_prince ($_tenya) with wide eyes . 
"
12560580,5,65,"""What?"" 
"
12560580,5,66,"The_prince ($_tenya) shook his ($_tenya) head as he ($_tenya) tried to stop his ($_tenya) fit , `` I ($_tenya) 'm sorry ... it 's just , you reminded me ($_tenya) so much of how my ($_tenya) old friend was ... he ($_tenya) always tried to play things off like they did n't matter .

"
12560580,5,67,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) frowned as looked at him ($_tenya) , `` What even happened to this old friend of yours ? '' 
"
12560580,5,68,"Suddenly , Izuku_'s ($_'s) giggles slowed to a full stop , and his ($_'s) face took a more somber expression . Sighing , he ($_'s) looked up at the boy with a contemplative look in his ($_'s) gaze . Turning his ($_'s) head , the_prince ($_tenya) opted to stare at some of the vines growing on the wall behind them ($_tenya) . 
"
12560580,5,69,"`` My ($_tenya) friend ... died , I ($_tenya) think ? ''

12560580,5,72,"Shaking his ($_'s) head , Izuku ($_izuku) looked back at him ($_'s) with determination , `` I ($_'s) 'm getting off track ; there 's still something I ($_'s) have to tell you ($_'s) . ''

"

"
12560580,5,76,"Izuku ($_izuku) let out a small chuckle , `` Okay , so the legend goes like this :

"
12560580,5,85,"The boy frowned , `` What ? '' 
"
12560580,5,86,"Turning his body just slightly , the_prince ($_tenya) pointed at the window , his smile turning sheepish , `` I ($_tenya) had been spying through this window before you came ... ''

"
12560580,5,92,"Stepping up to the window ledge , Katsuki ($_katsuki) leaned towards the window and peered through the material at the room beyond . In it was a lot of stone and a long green rug and some guards and

"
12560580,5,94,"As he ($_izuku) felt Izuku ($_izuku) walk up beside him ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) took note of the man that he ($_izuku) recognized from his ($_izuku) own nightmares and from the vision the late Great Midori Tree had shown him ($_izuku) . The short , fiery red hair and cold , blue eyes were hard to forget . He ($_izuku) was kneeling down on one knee , his ($_izuku) head facing downward .

12560580,5,130,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) nodded , `` And I 'll find the two other Spiritual Stones ! '' 
"
12560580,5,131,"`` Yes , '' Izuku ($_izuku) smiled . `` We 'll get the_Triforce ($_the) before Todoroki-san ($_todoroki-san) ... and we 'll stop him before he has a chance to strike ! It 's perfect ! '' 
"
12560580,5,132,"`` Oh , '' Izuku_'s ($_'s) eyes widened as he ($_'s) then turned to reach into his ($_'s) pocket . `` I ($_'s) almost forgot , you 'll need this . '' 
"
12560580,5,133,"Pulling out a thick sheet of paper and a pencil , he ($_'s) quickly scribbled something that Katsuki ($_katsuki) could not see . When he ($_'s) finished , he ($_'s) closed it with some gold blog and then handed it over him ($_'s) . He ($_'s) took note of the thick , waxy blob of gold on the center of the parchment . 
"
12560580,5,134,"`` It 's just a letter from me telling anyone who reads it that you are acting out by my request . '' 
"
12560580,5,135,"`` Um ... '' He ($_'s) shoved the letter into his ($_'s) satchel , `` Thanks ... '' 
"
12560580,5,136,"`` Now , '' Izuku ($_izuku) the began to slowly turn his ($_'s) head . `` Oh , there he ($_'s) is ! '' 
"
12560580,5,137,"He ($_'s) pointed towards the entrance of the courtyard , and Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) gaze followed . At the entrance , a tall man in all back and a white scarf stood , long black hair that fell over his ($_'s) shoulders , and his ($_'s) arms crossed over his ($_'s) chest . 
"
12560580,5,138,"`` My attendant will lead you out of the castle , '' the_prince ($_tenya) said with a smile . `` He looks a little scary sometimes , but do n't be afraid to talk to him . '' 
"
12560580,5,139,"`` I - I 'm not afraid ! '' He snapped indignantly . 
"
12560580,5,140,"Hands clasped behind him , Izuku ($_izuku) only smiled at him , `` Of course , well , I ($_izuku) suppose this is where we part ways for now . '' 
"
12560580,5,141,"The realization of that fact made Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) heart fall . He was hoping for a little more time to hang out with Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
12560580,5,142,"`` Yeah ... I guess I should go ... '' Shoulders hiking up as he puffed out his chest a bit . `` Got ta find your ($_kacchan) spiritual stones ! '' 
"
12560580,5,143,"`` Heh-heh , that 's right , '' the_prince_'s ($_tenya) eyes closed and his ($_tenya) head tilted to the side , his ($_tenya) hair delicately shifting against his ($_tenya) face . 
"
12560580,5,144,"`` I ($_tenya) believe in you ($_kacchan) , Kacchan ($_kacchan) . '' 
"
12560580,5,145,"`` Alright , Deku , I 'm off ! '' He ($_tenya) turned away and quickly made his ($_tenya) way down the stairs , Tenya ($_tenya) flying close behind him ($_tenya) , as he ($_tenya) felt his ($_tenya) face flame in red . The things Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
"
12560580,5,146,"He ($_tenya) should n't be this cute ! 
"
12560580,5,147,"Soon , much sooner than he ($_tenya) expected , Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked up as he ($_tenya) realized that he ($_tenya) was already standing in front of Izuku 's said attendant -LRB- whatever that meant -RRB- . 
"
12560580,5,148,"The man only looked down at him ($_tenya) with a frown , his ($_tenya) look accentuated by the weird prickles of black that marred the bottom of his ($_tenya) face -LRB- what are those ? -RRB- . 
"
12560580,5,149,"`` Hello , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , '' he ($_tenya) spoke , his ($_tenya) voice holding a mellow tone laced with intimidation . `` You may know me as Aizawa , one of the last few members of the Yamizoku Clan and responsible for the protection of Prince_Izuku ($_izuku) . '' 
"
12560580,5,150,"Eyes narrowing , the man , Aizawa , tilted his ($_aizawa) head down even further , `` As I ($_aizawa) 'm sure you already know , everything has been exactly as my ($_aizawa) prince foretold . '' 
"
12560580,5,151,"The boy could only give a curt nod . 
"
12560580,5,152,"`` My ($_aizawa) role in my ($_aizawa) my_prince_'s ($_tenya) dream was to teach a melody to the one who came from the forest . '' 
"
12560580,5,153,"His ($_aizawa) brows knitted together , `` A melody ... '' 
"
12560580,5,154,"`` Yes , '' the man snapped softly . `` This is an ancient melody that has been passed down the Royal Bloodline . '' 
"
12560580,5,155,"His ($_aizawa) eyes suddenly glazed over in a reminiscent haze , as if he ($_aizawa) was remembering something . 
"
12560580,5,156,"`` I ($_aizawa) 've played this song for Prince_Izuku ($_izuku) as a lullaby ever since he ($_aizawa) was a baby , '' shaking his ($_aizawa) head , he ($_aizawa) glared back down at the boy with a strange fierceness in his ($_aizawa) eyes . `` There is a mysterious power in these notes ; I ($_aizawa) advise you to listen carefully . '' 
"
12560580,5,157,"Pressing two fingers to his ($_aizawa) lips , Aizawa ($_aizawa) let out a string of notes in his ($_aizawa) whistle . It was soft and calm , a series of deep and high , a tranquil cacophony of sound that left Katsuki ($_katsuki) to sway his ($_katsuki) head little bit by little bit . 
"
12560580,5,158,"Tune abruptly stopping , the man took his fingers away from his lips and then gestured to the boy . 
"
12560580,5,159,"`` Your turn . '' 
"
12560580,5,160,"Jarring from his lyrical daze , he nodded and reached into his satchel , pulling out the ocarina that Ochako had given him . 
"
12560580,5,161,"Quickly he fingered the notes onto the instrument and played the tune . It sounded a bit different from Aizawa 's whistle , but he found that he liked the tune much better . 
"
12560580,5,162,"`` Good , '' he heard the man hum softly . `` Thank the gods above that you 're a quick learner . '' 
"
12560580,5,163,"`` Let 's go , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , '' turning , his ($_katsuki) black hair whipped around . `` If the castle soldiers find you , there will be trouble . I 'll lead you out another way . '' 
"
12560580,5,164,"""Okay...""
"
12560580,5,165,"Turning around , Katsuki ($_katsuki) was startled to see that Izuku was looking back at them with a small smile . The_prince ($_tenya) , realizing that he ($_katsuki) 'd been caught staring , appeared to have let out a small laugh and waved a hand of goodbye . 
"
12560580,5,166,"Giving a small smile back , Katsuki ($_katsuki) waved back at him ($_katsuki) before turning back and falling in step with Aizawa ($_aizawa) . 
"
12560580,5,167,"Within a minute , the two were already out of sight . 
"
12560580,5,168,". oO0Oo . 
"
12560580,5,169,"As the two finally walked off the drawbridge , out of the hustle and bustle that was the city of Musutafa , they came to a slow stop a few feet away from the dirt road . 
"
12560580,5,170,"`` You 're a brave kid , you know , '' Aizawa 's voice broke their silence . `` You 're taking on a daunting task , but it is a must . We have to protect and defend this land of ours . For the sake of all those who live here . '' 
"
12560580,5,171,"Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) face held a monotone look , `` I ($_katsuki) know ... '' 
"
12560580,5,172,"Taking a few paces away from the boy , Aizawa ($_aizawa) walked towards the direction of the small bridge that lied west from where they stood . Finally , after a small pause , he ($_aizawa) pointed to the looming , ominous rising mound of land that lied in the far distance , barred from the_field ($_field) by the enormous wall of rock and clay that resides a few feet away from the other side of the bridge . 
"
12560580,5,173,"`` Katsuki ($_katsuki) , I want you to take a good look at that mountain , '' he ($_aizawa) said as he ($_aizawa) looked back at the boy slowly walking up to his ($_aizawa) side . He ($_aizawa) continued only when the boy 's gaze had followed . 
"
12560580,5,174,"`` That is Shi Mountain , '' he ($_aizawa) stated , `` home of the Genso people . They are the caretakers of the Spiritual Stone of Fire . '' 
"
12560580,5,175,"Slowly nodding , the boy looked up at the man , `` So I have to go all the way up there ? '' 
"
12560580,5,176,"`` Not all the way ; they live somewhere around the middle of the peak and the foot . '' 
"
12560580,5,177,"`` Mmm ... '' 
"
12560580,5,178,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) turned back to face him ($_aizawa) , black hair cascading over his ($_aizawa) shoulders and face , `` At the foot of the mountain , up the stairway that 's been carved into the rock wall beyond the bridge , is my ($_aizawa) home-village , Kagekumo . '' 
"
12560580,5,179,"`` Kagekumo ... '' Katsuki 's eyes only furrowed . 
"
12560580,5,180,"`` Yes , it 's where I and all the other Yamizoku were born and raised . '' He hummed as he looked back over to the bridge . `` I suggest that you talk to some of the villagers there before you go up the mountain . '' 
"
12560580,5,181,"The boy pursed his lips before looking back at the man , `` Is there anyone I should look for in particular ? '' 
"
12560580,5,182,"`` The majority not all but the majority of the villagers will be a bit standoffish if you come up to them , '' Aizawa ($_aizawa) folded his ($_aizawa) arms over his ($_aizawa) chest . `` However , you 'll find a helping hand if you look for Yamada Hizashi . '' 
"
12560580,5,183,"`` What 's he ($_aizawa) like ? '' 
"
12560580,5,184,"`` He ($_aizawa) 's a character ; that 's the best way I can describe him ($_aizawa) . '' 
"
12560580,5,185,"`` Okay , then , '' the boy nodded his head before turning and walking towards the bridge , `` I 'm going now . '' 
"
12560580,5,186,"Suddenly , he was stopped in his tracks as he felt a tight binding enclose around his body . Looking down his eyes widened as he saw haphazard yet tight white bindings around his arms and stomach and legs . They had come out of nowhere , but they held a startling resemblance to 
"
12560580,5,187,"`` I was n't finished talking yet , kid , '' Aizawa 's sharp tongue sounded from behind . `` You 're both rude and impatient , I see . '' 
"
12560580,5,188,"Looking back , Katsuki ($_katsuki) only let out a soft gasp as the man gave a sharp tug on his scarf and soon the boy was immediately yanked from the ground and flung into the man 's arms . 
"
12560580,5,189,"`` What is that thing even made of , '' he demended as the man set him down on the ground , his white fabric seemingly moving on its own as it rewrapped itself around his neck . `` I thought it was just clothing . '' 
"
12560580,5,190,"`` Carbon fiber alloy infused with magic , but that 's not important right now . '' 
"
12560580,5,191,"`` Then what is it you wanted to tell me ? '' The boy 's bottom lip jutted out as his pouted with annoyance . 
"
12560580,5,192,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) only rolled his ($_aizawa) eyes before looking down at the boy , `` The song that I ($_aizawa) taught you to play on that little ocarina of yours ... '' 
"
12560580,5,193,"""Yeah...""
"
12560580,5,194,"`` Remember that only members of the_Royal_Family ($_the) and confidants are allowed to learn this song , '' he ($_aizawa) said , every word puncturing into a deeper meaning . `` It will help prove your connection with the_Royal_Family ($_the) , along with the letter that Prince_Izuku ($_izuku) gave you . '' 
"
12560580,5,195,"Giving a curt nod , Katsuki ($_katsuki) replied , `` I ($_katsuki) got it . '' 
"
12560580,5,196,"Closing his eyes , the man gave a sigh of what sounded like relief , `` Then just know that Prince_Izuku ($_izuku) and I will be waiting for your return to the castle courtyard with the stones . We 're counting on you . '' 
"
12560580,5,197,"As he turned away to go back to the draw bridge , he heard the boy shout . 
"
12560580,5,198,"`` I have something to ask you ! '' 
"
12560580,5,199,"Looking back at him , his eyes narrowed , `` What ? '' 
"
12560580,5,200,"Turning away slightly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) turned his ($_katsuki) gaze towards him ($_katsuki) , `` When Deku ($_deku) told me ($_katsuki) to go to you ($_katsuki) , it was like you ($_katsuki) appeared out of thin air ... how did you ($_katsuki) get to the courtyard so quickly ? '' 
"
12560580,5,201,"A smirk laughed onto Aizawa_'s ($_'s) lips as he ($_'s) chuckled , face now coated with mirth , he ($_'s) replied . 
"
12560580,5,202,"`` I never arrived , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , '' his ($_'s) grin now held an eerie feeling . `` I had always been in the courtyard with Prince_Izuku ($_izuku) . I am his ($_'s) attendant after all ; if I was n't with him ($_'s) , then I 'd be pretty bad at my job . '' 
"
12560580,5,203,"`` There 's no way , '' he ($_'s) countered . `` I ($_'s) never saw you at all until he ($_'s) pointed you out to me ($_'s) ; you were at the entrance then , but not before ! '' 
"
12560580,5,204,"Hands on his ($_'s) hips , the man sighed , smile still gracing his lips , `` I ($_'s) never said I ($_'s) was on the ground . I ($_'s) was on one of the castle courtyard wall 's ledges , up top . Out of sight and out of mind from those on the ground below , but I ($_'s) had the perfect bird 's eye view from where I ($_'s) stood . '' 
"
12560580,5,205,"Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) eyes widened as the glanced over at the man , the new information giving way for a startling realization . 
"
12560580,5,206,"""Wait, so that means ???""
"
12560580,5,207,"`` Yes , '' the cocky grin never left the man 's face . `` I ($_'s) saw you the minute you walked into the courtyard well , now even that 's a lie . I ($_'s) walked along the ledges , so actually I ($_'s) saw you long before you even got the courtyard . I ($_'s) have to admit ; it was pretty damn entertaining watching a kid get past all those guards . '' 
"
12560580,5,208,"`` I-if , if you 'd known I was there the entire time , why did n't you stop me ? '' 
"
12560580,5,209,"The man shrugged his shoulders , `` I assessed that you were n't a threat to my charge . Plus , I saw the symbol on your shield ... figured you might have been the kid my prince had the dream about . '' 
"
12560580,5,210,"Turning away , now filled with a new kind of caution for the man behind him , Katsuki ($_katsuki) asked , `` What if ... what if I ($_katsuki) had been a threat to Deku ($_deku) ? '' 
"
12560580,5,211,"`` If you had been a threat ? '' He could feel the feign of wonder Aizawa ($_aizawa) played . `` Well , my response would 've been simple . '' 
"
12560580,5,212,"""Yeah?"" 
"
12560580,5,213,"`` Indeed , why , if you had so much as reached into your bag or reached for your sword before you made yourself known to my prince ... 
"
12560580,5,214,"`` I would 've killed you on the spot . '' 
"
12560580,5,215,"Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) head whipped around so quickly he ($_katsuki) cringed at the small twinge of pain that throbbed from his ($_katsuki) neck , but he ($_katsuki) only dwelled on it for a moment as his ($_katsuki) eyes widened when he ($_katsuki) grasped the notion that Aizawa ($_aizawa) was no longer standing behind him ($_katsuki) . 
"
12560580,5,216,"Turning around completely , the boy turned his head this way and that , trying to spot the man and his white scarf , but it was to no avail . With eerie recollection , he had come to accept that it was just him and Tenya ($_tenya) alone in the stretch of land that was Yuuei_Field ($_field) . There was no longer another person in sight . 
"
12560580,5,217,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) had vanished like he ($_aizawa) was never there at all . # . "" Creepy ... '' He ($_aizawa) muttered .

"
12560580,5,220,"Lips jutting out in though , he tilted his head to the side as he sighed . Then with a quick shake of his head , he turned to the fairy and pointed at the small wooden sign that lied several feet along the road . Slowly his arm extended into the straight line , a single finger pointing at the enormous encircling wall of stone that stood along the soft slope of the hill so far beyond . 
"
12560580,5,221,"`` You know , '' he started with a small smirk . `` I think I wan na go take Gougou ($_gougou) up on his ($_gougou) offer to try some of his ($_gougou) ranch 's Gougou milk . ''

"
12560580,5,223,"Raising a brow , Katsuki ($_katsuki) began his ($_katsuki) walk towards the ranch , falling in step with the dirt path that led to the structure , `` When have I ($_katsuki) ever joked with you ? '' 
"
12560580,5,224,"`` But - but , Aizawa ($_aizawa) ! '' The fairy stumbled over his ($_katsuki) words as his ($_katsuki) arms flailed about . `` He ($_katsuki) just gave us a mission ! Prince_Midoriya ($_midoriya) just gave us a mission ! We may not have much time ''

12560580,5,225,"`` Which is why I want to get this out of the way now . ''
