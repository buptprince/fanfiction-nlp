ENOUGH ! 
The crowd stopped their cheering , the voice echoed around the fore court . Everyone looked around to see where the voice was coming from . The_King ($_the) looked over at his ($_the) wife , stunned at her outburst . 
Enji this time you have gone too far . Queen_Rei ($_queen) stood up off her ($_queen) chair , not looking at her ($_queen) husband . 
Untie that boy , he has done no wrong . His crimes are unwarranted ; he does not deserve this treatment . He is innocent . She ($_queen) yelled at the guard . The crowd where confused , mumbling wondering what was going on . Why did the_Queen ($_the) just stop the execution ? 
The rope was removed from Midoriya s neck as the_Queen ($_the) had just publicly requested , he was helped down from the stalls , not fully understanding what was going on all he knew was that he owed the_Queen ($_the) his life once again . The guard escorted him back through the door that he was dragged out of not too long ago . 
Queen_Rei ($_queen) turned around to see the amount of guards surrounding her ($_queen) son , disgusted with the way he was being treated . Todoroki ($_todoroki) s face was red and tear stained , his clothes where wrinkled from being held down , his expression was a mixture of stress and relief , he was breathing heavily , almost trying to catch his breath . 
Let. My son go . Right now. She ($_queen) was stern , stern enough to scare the guards that where holding him , they let go straight away as Todoroki ($_todoroki) took a deeper breath in , looking at his mother with fear still showing in his eyes . He didn t move , trying to regain some kind of self control . 
Thank you , he sobbed Thank you , He got up and held her ($_queen) tight , relived that she ($_queen) had saved his soul mate from what he thought was certain death , saving him from watching the love of his life die helplessly before him . 
Thank me later dear , you have a very scared soul mate waiting for you in the cells and I m sure there is nowhere else you would rather be right now . She ($_queen) kissed him lightly on the forehead before breaking their hug and pointing towards the door . Todoroki ($_todoroki) didn t think twice , he ran right out the door in a flash , Rei ($_rei) turned to face her ($_queen) husband , glaring at him and him glaring back at her ($_queen) . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) was running as fast as he could down the stairs to the cells , wiping his face of all the tears that he had been crying . He skilfully dodged the unsuspecting servants that where in the way , trying not to break his speed . He reached the door of the cells , pushing the door wide open to find his fianc locked in a cell . 
What is he locked back up for ?! Let him out this instant or it will be you at the stands ! He yelled at the guard beside Midoriya s cell . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) stood up the second he ($_midoriya) saw his ($_midoriya) red and white prince enter the damp room , he ($_midoriya) had never been so happy to see anyone . He ($_midoriya) ran up to the bars wanting to be as close to Todoroki as he ($_midoriya) could . The guard unlocked the cell gate , Midoriya ($_midoriya) pushed past him ($_midoriya) attacking Todoroki ($_todoroki) . He ($_midoriya) held him ($_midoriya) tightly , Todoroki ($_todoroki) held him ($_midoriya) back just as tight , the both of them collapsing on the cold floor in tears , the stress of the past 24 hours had taken its toll on the pair , they were just happy holding each other , neither one daring to let go . 
Izuku I m so sorry , I wanted to come get you so bad but I couldn t leave my room cause of the guards and The smaller male shushed his fianc , 
You have nothing to apologise for Shoto , this isn t your fault do not blame yourself , Midoriya ($_midoriya) shivered . 
Your freezing , let s get you warmed up , he took Midoriya ($_midoriya) s hand helping him up off the floor , his hands felt like ice . Todoroki ($_todoroki) led them to the main seating room where there was a fire already lit , He moved a chair closer to the fire place where Midoriya ($_midoriya) sat down . The heat felt good , the cold of the cells had made his body stiff . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) are you ($_midoriya) alright ? A rather panicked Rei walked into the room , she rushed over to the boys that where now holding each other in front of the fireplace , Todoroki ($_todoroki) was wrapping Midoriya ($_midoriya) in the blanket that was draped over the back of the chair . 
I-I m ok , just about , cold but alive . Thank you so much , if you didn t yell out when you did then I would be Todoroki shushed the freckled boy , wiping away the threatening tears at the corners of his eyes . 
You re ok now , that s all the matters . You have nothing to thank me for . She kneeled in front of them both holding their hands , letting out a sigh of relief . 
REI ! The door of the room was slammed closed ; the voice could only be one person . Rei s face was that of pure anger and disgust , she stood up and walked towards Enji ($_enji) . Shoto ($_shoto) held Izuku ($_izuku) tighter at the sight of his ($_shoto) so called father entering the room , He ($_shoto) felt Izuku ($_izuku) gripping onto his ($_shoto) shirt , this time Shoto ($_shoto) was going to protect Izuku ($_izuku) with his ($_shoto) life . Rei ($_rei) slapped Enji ($_enji) across the face with a strong force , leaving a glowing red hand print on his ($_enji) cheek . 
How DARE YOU ! Show your face in front of these two , have you not caused enough heartache for them ?! Look at the mess you have caused !! What next Enji ? Are you going to have our son killed for breathing ?! Hmm! Or will you have the guards drag Midoriya ($_midoriya) off again for your pathetic reasoning ? 
Rei ($_rei) , I 
DON T EVEN ATTEMPT TO TALK YOURSELF OUT OF THIS . You had our sons soul mate sentenced to death ?! Has your obsession with power gone to such lengths that it has clouded your judgement ?! Or are you just a foolish king ? Rei ($_rei) was angry , this man had hurt her ($_rei) son in ways she ($_rei) could not forgive . 
You owe both of these boys a very sincere apology to which they should not even think of accepting ! Midoriya ($_midoriya) was scared to death ! You had Shoto_held_down_like_some_dog ($_shoto) ! Like it ($_shoto) or not Enji Todoroki he ($_midoriya) is your son , and weather he ($_midoriya) loves men or women should not be a concern to you ! Your duty as a father is to love and protect him ($_midoriya) with your life , NOT THREATEN HIS ($_midoriya) WITH YOUR FOOLISHNESS ! Look for one second at the mess your son is in . LOOK AT MIDORIYA ($_midoriya) . We welcomed him ($_midoriya) into our family for Shoto ($_shoto) , not for you to do as you please . 
Rei ($_rei) pointed at the boys sitting the in the corner , still holding each other . The stress had become too much Midoriya , mixed with the warmth of the room and Todoroki ($_todoroki) s scent surrounding him he fell asleep . Todoroki ($_todoroki) lifted Midoriya in his arms , keeping the blanket around him as best as he could , 
We do not wish to hear it , nothing he will say will or do will make this better , you attacked my family , the person that I love and that is something I will never forgive . You can live with the hatred that I have for you now , these events will not go away because you demand them too . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) left the room , without saying anything else . The argument between Enji ($_enji) and Rei ($_rei) continued throughout the night , but Todoroki ($_todoroki) just wanted to sleep this horrible day away , forgetting it and hold his ($_iida) fianc . 
He ($_iida) set the sleeping boy down on the clean sheets , Iida ($_iida) must have had his ($_iida) room fixed at some point in this madness , he ($_iida) removed the dirty trousers that he ($_iida) had on and covered him ($_iida) with the bed covers . Izuku ($_izuku) looked peaceful ; the steady breathing from the green haired boy was soothing for Shoto ($_shoto) , knowing that his ($_iida) soul mate was safe in his ($_iida) sight , vowing to God that he ($_iida) would never let Izuku ($_izuku) face anything like that again . 
~ 2 weeks later ~ 
Right and why are we doing this again ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) struggled with his ($_midoriya) necktie , it seemed too short but at least it was staying on , right ? It didn t go down too well last time we told him ($_midoriya) . 
Because we have too , Todoroki ($_todoroki) untied the mess of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s neck tie and showed him ($_midoriya) how to do it properly for what seemed like the millionth time . 
You know it was so much easier when you wore the dresses , Todoroki ($_todoroki) giggled kissing his partner on his forehead . 
Let. It . GO . Midoriya ($_midoriya) scrunched up his ($_midoriya) face , the whole castle where still making dress jokes at him ($_midoriya) , surely it was a dead joke by this point . Even Iida ($_iida) seems to have given up now . 
Never , I plan to tell our children the story of how one of their dads cross dressed to my 18 th , Todoroki ($_todoroki) laughed . As much as Midoriya ($_midoriya) wanted to hit him he was glad to see his fianc so happy , almost everyone had already forgotten the mess that was a couple weeks ago , the pain he felt being separated from Todoroki ($_todoroki) was nothing but a distant feeling . 
Anyway , let s go , before Iida ($_iida) comes and whips us to it again . The boys headed towards the doors of what was now their bedroom when Todoroki ($_todoroki) stopped and turned to Midoriya , and Izuku ($_izuku) 
Yes Shoto ($_shoto) ? Those emerald eyes that Todoroki ($_todoroki) loved so much looked up at him , staring right into his own hetrochromic eyes , until Todoroki ($_todoroki) leaned in and kissed his fianc . It was a light kiss , but one still filled with love , but this didn t stop Izuku ($_izuku) pulling him in closer and holding Todoroki ($_todoroki) close . After a few seconds they broke the kiss . 
Everything will be fine this time , my mother is watching over all of my father s engagements now , so no more death threats . Shoto ($_shoto) smiled as he ($_shoto) took the smaller boys hand , intertwining his ($_shoto) fingers with Izuku ($_izuku) s . They left the room together walking down the hall towards the main hall . 
~x~
Prince Shoto and Master_Midoriya_,_your_highness_Iida ($_highness) opened the door smiling , knowing why they boys where in a good mood today , he ($_highness) nodded at Todoroki ($_todoroki) before closing the door behind them . 
Hello baby !! Rei ($_rei) got up off her ($_rei) throne and ran to give her ($_rei) son a hug , she ($_rei) squeezed him ($_highness) tightly almost making it hard for the dual toned boy to breathe . 
Mother please Rei ($_rei) let go pouting 
You will never be too old for my hugs , she ($_rei) giggled as she ($_rei) turned to Midoriya and gave him ($_highness) a hug as well , not as tight but still rather uncomfortable . 
What brings you boys here today then ? Do you need something ? Rei ($_rei) sat back on her ($_rei) throne , smiling at the pair as they held each other s hands once again . They looked at each other before they looked back at the King and Queen staring at them . 
Well actually we have something that we have to tell you , Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled , this time he ($_midoriya) wasn t scared , mostly because Rei ($_rei) was there , but also because he ($_midoriya) was with Shoto ($_shoto) . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) and I ($_midoriya) are engaged to be married , Shoto ($_shoto) said with a wide smile on his ($_midoriya) face , Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled as well , holding onto his ($_midoriya) fianc s arm tightly trying to hide some of his ($_midoriya) excitement . This time things felt different , a good different . 
You ($_midoriya) alr - King Enji was cut off by a rather excited Rei running back down to the pair , holding them both tightly in her ($_enji) arms , coughing back tears of joy . 
My ($_midoriya) baby is getting married , she ($_enji) sniffed , We will start getting it all planned right away !!! IIDA ($_iida) ! Rei ($_rei) was over the moon , almost jumping for joy as she ($_enji) turned around to her ($_enji) husband , glaring at him . 
Isn t this wonderful dear , we have a wedding coming up . Our baby is going to get married ! 
Mmm . It s wonderful dear . Enji s tone of voice did not match his words . Not that it mattered to anyone else in the room . Enji ($_enji) was under his ($_enji) wife s careful watch now , as she ($_enji) insisted that she ($_enji) sat in all of their important meetings and attended all of the important journeys . The trust between them had been shattered and for good reason . 
It seems are kingdom will have 2 fine kings ruling it one day , I m so happy for you boys ! The mood was happy and light , something that the castle needed after the low mood that had been flowing through it for the past couple of weeks . Rei ($_rei) started mumbling about wedding plans and other things , but the boys were not listening , they were too busy looking at each other , imagining the rest of their lives together . 
King_Enji ($_king) stood up from his ($_king) throne and left the room , nothing he ($_king) would have said would have meant a thing to either of the boys . The_king ($_king) had tried to talk to them a few times afterwards but the pair had made it very clear that they wanted nothing to do with him ($_king) . To them he ($_king) was just their King and nothing more . 
SO , Rei ($_rei) grabbed both boys by the arms and started leading them towards the doors , 
To the Library , I want to hear all of your plans so far ! Both of you ! We ll have Iida ($_iida) make us tea as well ! Also Izuku ($_izuku) what dress size should we order you ? 
OMG LET IT GO !! Todorokis . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) woke up to an empty bed , something he ($_midoriya) wasn t quite used too . He ($_midoriya) searched for his ($_midoriya) partner on the cold side of the bed but he ($_midoriya) was not there . As Midoriya ($_midoriya) sat up the cold morning air was quick to attack his ($_midoriya) warm body , he ($_midoriya) looked around the room , only to realise that this wasn t the room that he ($_midoriya) shared with Todoroki ($_todoroki) . This was the room that he ($_midoriya) stayed in when he ($_midoriya) had first come to the castle , when he ($_midoriya) first met Todoroki ($_todoroki) . 
He ($_midoriya) looked over at the small table where a silver tray was waiting for him ($_midoriya) ; Iida ($_iida) must have left him ($_midoriya) his ($_iida) breakfast without waking him ($_midoriya) up , how strange . 
Hanging over the sofa was a white ball gown . . 
IIDA TENYA ! Midoriya ($_midoriya) yelled , as the_servant_boy ($_midoriya) opened the door trying not to laugh at what Izuku ($_izuku) hoped was just a cruel joke . 
Good_morning_Midoriya_,_excited_for_your_wedding ($_midoriya) ? 
What is that doing in here ?! Midoriya ($_midoriya) pointed at the white ball gown that was hanging over the sofa , last time Midoriya ($_midoriya) checked his ($_midoriya) outfit of choice for his ($_midoriya) wedding wasn t * ANOTHER * dress It seems that the running joke he ($_midoriya) thought was finally over , wasn t. 
Why it s your wedding dress , surely you haven t forgotten what day it is today . Iida ($_iida) was doing all he ($_iida) could not to burst into laughter , the face of worry that was on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face was almost too much for him ($_iida) to handle . 
Iida ($_iida) you have 3 seconds Midoriya ($_midoriya) got up out of his ($_midoriya) bed , walking over to the tray of food that was left for him ($_midoriya) grabbing one of the rolls , tossing it about in his ($_midoriya) hands , threatening to throw it at the square man . 
Ok ok , He ($_midoriya) giggled as he ($_midoriya) moved the dress to reveal what Izuku ($_izuku) was actually going to wear . It was a white suit , freshly pressed waiting for him ($_midoriya) to wear on the biggest day of his ($_midoriya) life . Midoriya ($_midoriya) ate his ($_midoriya) breakfast quickly , his ($_midoriya) excitement building with each bite , some of the servant girls had come in and started to fuss with his ($_midoriya) face and his ($_midoriya) hair which he ($_midoriya) didn t like too much . But something told him ($_midoriya) Rei ($_rei) was behind it . 
He ($_midoriya) and Shoto ($_shoto) didn t get much say when it came to their wedding , between Rei ($_rei) and Iida ($_iida) pretty much planning everything for them . The only thing that they had any say in was who was going to be in attendance , Midoriya ($_midoriya) didn t invite as many people as Todoroki ($_todoroki) had too . He ($_midoriya) invited his ($_midoriya) mother , who had to be there anyway , Bakugo and Kirishima where invited , but he ($_midoriya) has heard nothing back from them . There were a few others from the Yagi village that Midoriya ($_midoriya) had invited , Todoroki ($_todoroki) s list was full of nobles and important people that Midoriya ($_midoriya) had never heard of but he ($_midoriya) guessed that Todoroki ($_todoroki) had to invite them as some royal duty . 
~x~
2.25 pm . 
Invited guests started making their way into the church hall , the atmosphere was buzzing . The first gay wedding in royal history was about to happen right in front of them , they where here to witness history . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) stood at the front of the hall nervously . Iida ($_iida) was trying to keep him ($_midoriya) calm , after being asked to be the best man he ($_midoriya) wasn t able to refuse , what a honour for a simple servant to be the best man of a royal wedding . 
King_Enji ($_king) and Queen_Rei ($_queen) where one of the last to enter the church , Rei wearing a stunning royal blue dress that hit the floor perfectly , lighting up her ($_queen) grey eyes . King_Enji_wearing_his_over_the_top_outfit_as_he_would_normally_,_beside_them ($_over) his ($_over) over the top outfit as he ($_over) would normally , beside them was Inko , she ($_queen) was in a simple pink dress with her ($_queen) hair tied up in a high bun , she ($_queen) sat beside the King and Queen ($_queen) as mother of the bride er groom . 
There was only one person missing now , the one person Todoroki ($_todoroki) wanted to see the most today . The music started playing throughout the church as the crowd stopped their conversations to get a glimpse of the arriving groom . 
Izuku ($_izuku) walked down the aisle alone , with a white veil now draped over his ($_izuku) head , this didn t bother him ($_izuku) though because right in front of him ($_izuku) was the man he ($_izuku) was going to spend the rest of his ($_izuku) life with . It took every fibre of his ($_izuku) being not to run down the aisle to him ($_izuku) . 
He ($_izuku) stood beside Todoroki , who was looking down at Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Their eyes met and it felt like they were falling for each other all over again . Promising their lives to each other for as long as they both live , Midoriya ($_midoriya) promising to keep Todoroki ($_todoroki) strong when times got hard and Todoroki ($_todoroki) promising to keep Midoriya ($_midoriya) safe , even if it ($_todoroki) mean laying his ($_midoriya) own life on the line . Inko ($_inko) smiled at that , remembering how she ($_inko) got to slap Todoroki after a certain incident . 
The feeling of love that filled the room was too much for some of the on goers to bear , with a few crying at the beautiful ceremony going on in front of them . The sound of heart filled promises and vows for one another were enough to even bring a tear to the Kings eye . 
With the power invested in me , I pronounce you married in the eyes of God . You may kiss your husband Izuku ($_izuku) kissed Todoroki ($_todoroki) without a second of hesitation , wrapping his ($_izuku) arms around his ($_izuku) neck , standing on the tips of his ($_izuku) toes , locking his ($_izuku) lips to Todoroki ($_todoroki) s in the most important kiss that they will ever share . Todoroki ($_todoroki) held Midoriya ($_midoriya) s back , supporting him ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) kissed him ($_izuku) back with an equal passion . 
~x~
The party afterwards was extravagant . The whole town was invited to a party that would never bet topped . The main hall of the castle was open for all , with as much food as they could possibly get into it , the dining hall was full of dancers and performers , music filled the whole castle , you could hear the party from any room . The forecourt was a festival of its own , with food stands filled with sweets and treats , fireworks and sparklers and other memorabilia to celebrate the wedding of the 2 kings . 
Midoriya and Todoroki ($_todoroki) were dancing together in the dining hall among the others , dancing like they did that first time in the garden , but this time they had music to help guide them . Inko ($_inko) was dancing with Rei ($_rei) in one of the corners of the room , giggling , enjoying their time together talking about a range of different topics throughout the_night ($_the) . But King_Enji ($_king) was not to be seen . In fact he ($_king) was not invited to the festivities after the ceremony . Shoto ($_shoto) had made it very clear that if he ($_king) was not able to accept their love for what it was then he ($_king) didn t want him ($_king) near the one day that they would look back on for the rest of their lives . 
The married couple couldn t keep their hands off of one another , as the_night ($_the) slowed down and the partying was coming to an end they sneaked away . They ended up in the gardens where they first spent their days together , kissing , hugging and laughing with each other as they wound down from the party . 
I love you Izuku Midoriya , Midoriya ($_midoriya) placed his ($_midoriya) finger over Todoroki ($_todoroki) s mouth , 
Izuku Todoroki , He ($_midoriya) smiled as he ($_midoriya) moved his ($_midoriya) finger , replacing it with a kiss . 
~x~
Over on the far hill , overlooking the fun was a girl with blonde buns in her ($_fuyumi) hair , smiling at the music she ($_fuyumi) could hear , wishing she ($_fuyumi) could join in . 
What the hell are you smiling at ? A man dressed in black was standing behind her ($_fuyumi) , 
Something pretty , She ($_fuyumi) looked at the man standing behind her ($_fuyumi) , im guessin yer here to come get me then 
Toga right , Toga Himiko ? The girl smiled at the sound of her ($_fuyumi) name , standing back up while watching the party one last time in the distance . That s me . 
~ 2 years later ~ 
FUYUMI TODOROKI GET DOWN RIGHT NOW ! 
No !! Yelled the small child , she ($_fuyumi) was sitting on top of one of the bookcases in the library , Iida ($_iida) was left to watch her ($_fuyumi) however was failing , as always . 
Get down and I won t tell your dad s about the ice cream you stole from the kitchens . Again. Iida ($_iida) was grasping at straws , the Kings where due home any moment and he ($_iida) had to somehow get this obnoxious child back onto the ground . 
Ooorrr you leave me up here and I won t tell my dad s about the ice cream you gave me from the kitchens , she ($_fuyumi) stuck out her ($_fuyumi) tongue , she ($_fuyumi) knew she ($_fuyumi) wasn t going to let Iida ($_iida) get into trouble , but she ($_fuyumi) wanted to play with him ($_iida) a little while longer . It wasn t the first time that she ($_fuyumi) had climbed up here and gave her ($_fuyumi) adopted fathers a mini heart attack . 
The sound of the horses in the forecourt made Iida ($_iida) sweat , surely the kings would notice their child wasn t greeting them after their trip . Iida ($_iida) turned around to yell at the little girl once again but found she ($_fuyumi) had already climbed down . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) had run out of the library and was heading for the main doors ; she ($_fuyumi) had heard the sound of her ($_fuyumi) dad s horses and was excited to see them again . Iida ($_iida) was running after her ($_fuyumi) . 
Welcome home your majesty s , One of the servant girls was there to greet the_Kings ($_the) back to the castle when Fuyumi B-lined right for Shoto ($_shoto) . She ($_fuyumi) jumped right into his arms ; catching her ($_fuyumi) of course he hugged the small child . 
Hello trouble , did you behave ? Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) nodded as a winded Iida finally caught up , fixing himself ($_fuyumi) in front of the_kings ($_the) , 
Welcome home , He bowed as Shoto ($_shoto) gave a death glare to Fuyumi , 
We raced , he lost , Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) smiled as she ($_fuyumi) reached for Midoriya ($_midoriya) , Midoriya ($_midoriya) was her ($_fuyumi) favourite out of the couple , but only because he spoiled her ($_fuyumi) uncontrollably . 
Why are you covered in dust ? Izuku ($_izuku) wiped off some of the dust marks on the little girls dress as her ($_fuyumi) face had gone bright red , 
Your monkey of a daughter was climbing the bookcases in the library , again . Iida ($_iida) stared at the devil spawn that the_Kings ($_the) adopted only a few months ago , with King_Enji ($_king) getting sick the throne was passed onto Shoto ($_shoto) quite quickly and quite frankly , overdramatically . However the couple where talking about adopting before the former king had gotten sick , and when they met the grubby faced Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) at the orphanage they fell in love instantly . She ($_fuyumi) was shy to begin with , but once settled in became a royal pain in the ass . 
Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) , we told you not to climb the bookcases , if one of them was to fall as you where climbing and you got hurt then we would both be really sad , Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned , which Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) didn t like , she ($_fuyumi) hated seeing her ($_fuyumi) papa frown , She ($_fuyumi) looked over to her ($_fuyumi) other dad who was also frowning . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) was now really sad , tears started forming , streaming down her ($_fuyumi) face . 
Hey now , no crying , just promise us you won t do it again . Midoriya ($_midoriya) gave her ($_fuyumi) a wide smile as she ($_fuyumi) wiped the tears off her ($_fuyumi) face . 
I promise . She ($_fuyumi) smiled back .
