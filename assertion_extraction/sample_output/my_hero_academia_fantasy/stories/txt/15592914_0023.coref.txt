That next morning , Shouto ($_shouto) got up and went to make breakfast for the whole crowd . There were six of them now , if he ($_shouto) included himself ($_shouto) and Shinsou ($_shinsou) . That was a good number of mouths to feed . However , when he ($_shouto) got downstairs and found that everyone was already up and getting ready . The only ones missing from the scene were himself ($_shouto) and Izuku ($_izuku) . He ($_shouto) d forgotten how late they had stayed up that night talking that morning . We must have slept in late . I should go wake him ($_shouto) up , so he ($_shouto) doesn t miss the day , Shouto ($_shouto) thought , only he ($_shouto) was stopped before he ($_shouto) could retreat back upstairs . 
Good morning sleepyhead , Uraraka ($_uraraka) exclaimed . 
What time is it ? Do I want to know ? 
It s almost noon , Iida ($_iida) scolded . Todoroki ($_todoroki) , I must admit I expected better of a wizard of your stature , especially now that you ve been appointed Royal Wizard ! 
I m not the Royal Wizard , he insisted . And I usually wake up earlier . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) , you have officially been appointed Royal Wizard in All Might s absence . You can t just ignore your duties , Iida ($_iida) insisted . 
Watch-???
Let s . Um drop this for now , Uraraka ($_uraraka) interjected . She didn t want her friends to fight , and she knew whatever Shouto ($_shouto) was about to say would only upset Iida ($_iida) . The two were still fuming at eachother , but Todoroki ($_todoroki) backed down and softened his expression again . 
Fine , the wizard said . I was going to go wake up Izuku ($_izuku) , but it occurs to me ... none of you have had breakfast , have you ? I ll get on that , then I ll get him up to eat too . 
Actually , I already cooked breakfast for them all , said a soft voice that Shouto hadn t noticed before . It was Rei . 
Mom , he startled . I didn t realize you could get Shinsou ($_shinsou) to behave like that . 
He s not the first fire demon I ve dealt with , Shouto ($_shouto) . Besides , I wasn t about to let your friends starve . I think I still have a while to maintain this form , I m getting better at it . I can make you breakfast too if you d like . It s been so long since I was able to cook for my baby . 
He now knew how Izuku ($_izuku) felt when Inko ($_inko) was sharing his ($_inko) embarrassing stories that day they d toured the apartment . Despite the embarrassment he should have felt , he couldn t find it in himself to care too much . It was awkward being called a baby , being a grown adult man , but this was his mother . He hadn t gotten the chance to have too many real conversations with her since she d arrived in the castle . 
It s alright , Mom . I ll cook for myself . You just rest up . 
You always were so independent , she cooed , as she pet him on the shoulder . 
He got to work cracking eggs into the frying pan on top of Shinsou ($_shinsou) , who didn t seem happy to be used for cooking twice in one morning ($_morning) if it still counted as morning ($_morning) . He grumbled in displeasure . 
Why don t you just use your fire power to cook breakfast ? You re using that hald now , but you still make me do all the hard work ! 
Hush , you , he said to the demon . 
He looked up to meet the eyes of his mother , who was smiling fondly at him from the kitchen table . He had talked to her a few nights before about using his fire power . He d recounted the things that Izuku ($_izuku) had told him , and asked her if she thought it was right . He wanted to use it , but wanted to make sure she agreed before he could use the power without regrets . She d said that she was proud of him for all he d accomplished in the six years they d been apart , and was glad to see him making progress . Ultimately , it was his power , and she said the decision was his to make , but she would support him no matter what . 
She nodded softly , as they both understood where each other s thoughts had gone . He went back to scrambling eggs and cooking bacon , until he felt a tap on his shoulder . It was Uraraka ($_uraraka) this time . 
I m going to go wake up Deku , since you both overslept . 
Oh , thank you , he muttered . 
She nodded and went off to wake her best friend from his slumber . Izuku ($_izuku) deserved to sleep in , but anyone sleeping past noon seemed wasteful to Shouto . He ($_izuku) liked waking up early , and sleeping in as late as he ($_izuku) had that morning ($_morning) would have driven him ($_izuku) crazy if he ($_izuku) hadn t had a good reason for it . 
He ($_izuku) went back to cooking , and soon enough he ($_izuku) heard laughter coming from the stairs . The pair were walking in , apparently joking with each other . Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes met Shouto ($_shouto) s and he ($_izuku) blushed , turning back to Uraraka . She just smiled knowingly . I wonder what that was about . They came downstairs and the two boyfriends ate breakfast together , the_green_eyes_man_barely_making_eye_contact_the_whole_time ($_momo) . He ($_momo) found himself ($_momo) curious . Did I do something wrong ? 
Deku and I are going to go check on your scarecrow friend , Uraraka ($_uraraka) announced suddenly to the wizard . We shouldn t be long . 
Alright , he ($_momo) said hesitantly . Out of all the entrances , the garden was the safest place , since the flower shop was compromised by Dabi , and the rest of the wastes were always dangerous . He ($_momo) still didn t like the idea of them going out there alone for some reason . Maybe it was that wizard intuition , or maybe he ($_momo) just wanted to spend more time with his ($_momo) boyfriend . 
The duo left the room , and Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_momo) staring at the door . He ($_momo) wasn t alone in his ($_momo) stare as Iida ($_iida) , Momo ($_momo) , Shinsou , and his ($_momo) mother were also looking . 
Izuku ($_izuku) is certainly acting strange , Iida ($_iida) observed . 
Momo ($_momo) nodded . 
I haven t seen him ($_momo) act like that in a few weeks . I wonder what s changed . 
Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_shouto) wondering the same things . Was it because of what had happened that morning ($_morning) ? Maybe Izuku ($_izuku) had been more uncomfortable with the whole bath situation than he ($_izuku) d let on ? Maybe he ($_izuku) d heard Shouto ($_shouto) try and confess again and was getting fed up with his ($_izuku) inability to tell him ($_izuku) the truth on how he ($_izuku) felt ? Maybe he ($_izuku) didn t want to stay in a relationship with someone who couldn t love him ($_izuku) back , or at least couldn t tell him ($_izuku) . No . He ($_izuku) s not like that , you re just being paranoid , he ($_izuku) reminded himself ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) was trying to be better at calling himself ($_izuku) out in that way , and stopping himself ($_izuku) from worrying too much . It will be fine . Whatever is going on , Uraraka ($_uraraka) is on it ($_uraraka) . 

Izuku ($_izuku) followed his ($_izuku) best friend outside , where she led him ($_izuku) into the gardens and to the cottage at the end of the field . He ($_izuku) knew that meeting the strange scarecrow wasn t Uraraka s only motive for bringing him ($_izuku) out here . He ($_izuku) could see the look in her eye when she was about to give him ($_izuku) a talking to . Whenever she had something serious to talk about , she put on her signature face . Her brows furrowed together and her eyes showed the most intimidating determination he d ever seen . She had a powerful aura about her , and it would have scared him if she wasn t his best friend . 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) ? 
Yes? She replied too quickly , and her voice was not the same plucky one he was used to . This was much more aggressive . 
Why are we really out here ? 
You re acting way too awkward around Todoroki ($_todoroki) even after the talk we had earlier , so I brought you out here to clarify . 
The first discussion they d had was what she d woken him up with . She shook his shoulder until he was conscious , and then she broke it to him that he d slept until noon . She followed this up by asking exactly what he and Shouto ($_shouto) had done that night that left them both so tired . He d half wished Iida ($_iida) was the one to wake him up , because he wouldn t think twice about them both sleeping in . He would have just assumed they were both tired coincidentally . 
Izuku ($_izuku) insisted it wasn t what she thought . They had only stayed up late because Shouto ($_shouto) had a panic attack and he ($_shouto) was worried about him ($_shouto) . They d both been so caught up talking with each other that they lost track of time and fell asleep eventually due to exhaustion . Uraraka ($_uraraka) thought that was sweet , but looked sad when he ($_uraraka) mentioned the wizards near confession . 
You have to be patient , Deku . You know he ($_uraraka) cares about you , right ? 
I know , I just don t know how to feel about these near confessions . It s like he ($_uraraka) wants to tell me , but he ($_uraraka) can t bring himself ($_uraraka) to say it . What if he ($_uraraka) s just forcing himself ($_uraraka) to say it because I confessed to him ($_uraraka) first ? What if I m making him ($_uraraka) feel bad ? I mean , he ($_uraraka) did say he ($_uraraka) s incapable of love . 
I don t believe him ($_uraraka) on that , and he ($_uraraka) wouldn t just confess to you out of obligation . Deku ($_deku) , you ve been nothing but good for him ($_uraraka) and he ($_uraraka) can see that . Just because he ($_uraraka) hasn t said it yet , doesn t mean he ($_uraraka) doesn t love you . He ($_uraraka) just has some things to work through before he ($_uraraka) can tell you . 
How can you be sure ? 
A wizard has her ways , she retorted . 
Hey , I have magic too you know ! 
I know you do , and I m so happy for you ! Maybe I ll get to see it in action some time , she said in her usual bubbly tone . His best friend was back . 
Anyways , I heard that you have your own romance going on . 
What? How did - did Todoroki ($_todoroki) tell you ? 
Mhm . 
I wanted to tell you in person , that s why I didn t write to you about her . I really like this girl , Deku ($_deku) . 
What s her name ? 
Well her wizard name is Froppy , but I call her Tsu . She specializes in , get this , frog magic ! She has a lot of frog like attributes that seem to run in her family because of some dark magic a few generations ago . She even makes frog noises sometimes ! It s really cute . 
Neat! 
I know right ? She s one of Thirteen s other interns , so we see each other nearly every day . I don t think Thirteen knows we re dating , but he s a bit clueless about teen dating habits . I mean , he thought Todoroki and I were dating , can you believe it ? 
Ha ha , Izuku chuckled nervously . Who would believe something silly like that , right ? 
Anyways , he wanted us to work together on difficult spells , and we sort of worked together too well . We make a great team ! 
I m really happy for you ! 
Thanks , I m happy too . I m glad we had this talk , but before we go back inside , I want to see this All_Might ($_all) looking scarecrow ! 
Oh- sure! I have to check in on him anyways , make sure everything is going alright . 
You mean going ... All_Might ($_all) , she chuckled . 
Izuku ($_izuku) burst out in laughter . He ($_izuku) was a sucker for a good pun , and Uraraka ($_uraraka) knew it . All Might puns were very important to him ($_izuku) . 
The duo approached the safehouse where the scarecrow resided , and Izuku ($_izuku) poked his ($_izuku) head in . He ($_izuku) caught the scarecrow staring out the window , overlooking the field . He ($_izuku) walked over to join him ($_izuku) . From the outside of the cottage , the windows looked in on an empty house no matter what . It was only from the inside that the windows told the truth . The view looking out was gorgeous . He ($_izuku) could see the whole field of flowers , and then the mountains i the distance past it all . 
Hello , Izuku ($_izuku) greeted the creature . 
Good afternoon , young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) , he ($_midoriya) greeted back . How are you ($_dabi) ? 
I m good , thanks . Just thought I would check in on you ($_dabi) . Also I have a friend who wanted to meet you ($_dabi) , if that s alright . 
That would be lovely , he ($_midoriya) said as he ($_midoriya) followed Izuku ($_izuku) to the doorway and outside to where Uraraka ($_uraraka) was waiting . Her ($_uraraka) eyes widened at the sight before her ($_uraraka) . Her ($_uraraka) jaw dropped as she ($_uraraka) looked over the scarecrow . 
The resemblance is uncanny ! I mean if All_Might ($_all) lost a hundred pounds of muscle he ($_all) might look like this ! Where did you ($_dabi) find him ($_all) ? 
I found him ($_all) in the wastes , upside down in a bush . Though , he ($_all) can talk now , thanks to Shouto . You ($_dabi) can ask him ($_all) questions directly . 
She turned to the scarecrow man and thought it over for a second , still deciding what questions she should ask . She seemed to settle on one , and she went over to the scarecrow to ask face to face . 
Do you ($_dabi) know why you ($_dabi) were made to look like All_Might ($_all) ? 
Uraraka_,_Izuku ($_uraraka) protested . It seemed a bit rude , and he ($_uraraka) couldn t answer anyways . 
No , it s fine my boy . I don t know why I was made like this . Young_Todoroki ($_todoroki) believes I have a haze spell put over me , preventing me from accessing my memories . 
Huh , she said . That makes sense . 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) was about to continue asking questions , when there was the sound of a cracking twig to their side , drawing he ($_uraraka) attention of the whole trio . Izuku ($_izuku) saw a man with jet black hair and a tired looking face step out from the side of the cabin . He ($_izuku) feigned surprise at being caught by them . 
Oops , I didn t mean to sneak up on you ($_dabi) like that , he ($_izuku) said in a less than sincere tone . Hello everyone . 
Deku_,_Uraraka ($_uraraka) asked tentatively . Who is this ? 
This is - 
I m Todoorki s brother . My name is Dabi , nice to meet you ($_dabi) , he ($_izuku) said offering his ($_izuku) hand to Uraraka . 
She ($_shouto) was hesitant to accept the handshake , and Izuku ($_izuku) stepped in front of her ($_shouto) defensively . She ($_shouto) had always defended him ($_izuku) , now it was his ($_izuku) time to return the favor . He ($_izuku) knew what Shouto ($_shouto) had said about this man , and he ($_izuku) didn t trust him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) wasn t really family , he ($_izuku) was just another one of Endeavor s henchmen . 
Don ($_don) t listen to him ($_izuku) , Uraraka ($_uraraka) ! 
Tch , is that any way to treat your ($_dabi) boyfriend s family ? 
I don t believe you ($_dabi) , Dabi ($_dabi) . You ($_dabi) re not really a Todoroki , you ($_dabi) re just a demon . 
Is that really what you ($_dabi) believe ? Even after the proof I showed you ($_dabi) ? 
He reached forwards and grabbed Izuku ($_izuku) s locket that hung around his neck , causing Izuku ($_izuku) to choose between stepping closer to Dabi , or having the locket ripped off . Izuku ($_izuku) had to regain his ($_izuku) balance , as he ($_izuku) nearly fell over from the force of the grab . He ($_izuku) stood as far away from Dabi ($_dabi) as the necklace would allow . 
Hey , back off , Uraraka ($_uraraka) yelled , pushing him ($_izuku) away , and releasing Izuku ($_izuku) from the man s grip . Izuku ($_izuku) grasped at the necklace , and covered it protectively . 
Meanwhile , the demon looked surprised at having been pushed . He d evidently underestimated Uraraka ($_uraraka) s abilities . Izuku ($_izuku) realized the demon didn t know anything about her ($_izuku) . She ($_izuku) was a wildcard in Endeavor s plan evidently . What else did the man not know about ? Dabi ($_dabi) was clearly spying on himself ($_dabi) and Shouto ($_shouto) , since he ($_dabi) knew they were dating , and he ($_dabi) knew about the flower shop . Now , he ($_dabi) knew about the field and the safehouse , which wasn t ideal . Did he ($_dabi) know where the castle was at the moment ? Did he ($_dabi) know where the black door went ? 
Dabi ($_dabi) , Izuku said through gritted teeth . Even if you were Shouto ($_shouto) s brother that doesn t give you any right to be part of his ($_shouto) life if he ($_shouto) doesn t want you in it . You can t decide who he ($_shouto) talks to , and neither can I , so why are you still bothering me about this ? It s not something I could change even if I wanted to . 
Haven t you noticed ? You can change a lot of things with your magic , Izuku Midoriya . 
I would never help you ! 
But , you already are helping me . Thank you for your time . I guess I ll leave you to go back to the castle . I d tell you to give my regards to Shouto but I suppose it s too late for that now , he sneered . 
I won t fall for your tricks , Izuku ($_izuku) yelled at him . 
Then go see for yourself . Or , more accurately , don t see . I ll tell him you miss him when he s back at the mansion , he snickered as his body went up in flames and became nothing . He was gone without a trace , and in his place he d left a sinking fear that sickened Izuku ($_izuku) to his ($_izuku) gut . 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) , we have to go make sure Shouto ($_shouto) is okay ! I m going to run back to the castle ! Make sure the scarecrow gets into the_Safehouse ($_the) ! 
Okay , I m on it ($_the) ! 
It ($_the) couldn t be true ! That curse hadn t been fulfilled yet , had it ($_the) ? How could he have taken Shouto ($_shouto) when he was safe inside the castle ? What was he missing ? His mind ran a mile a minute , and his legs only wished they could travel as fast . Each second that he spent moving towards the castle was a second that Endeavor could be there , taking Shouto ($_shouto) away from him forever . He felt hot tears rolling down his cheeks , and being blown away by the air that rushed in his face from the speed at which he was running . He knew his body wasn t supposed to run so fast , but he couldn t care . 
Come on , legs ! Don ($_don) t give up now , I need to save him ! 

Todoroki ($_todoroki) , don t you think they should be back by now ? 
It was Momo who asked . They had been sitting in the house awaiting Uraraka and Izuku ($_izuku) s return for quite some time now . He hoped they were alright , but he had a bad feeling about it . Something didn t sit right in his gut , like his organs were twisting in on each other slowly . Momo ($_momo) was right . Uraraka ($_uraraka) had said they would only be a moment , hadn t she ? 
I m starting to get worried , he agreed . I should go check on them . 
It could be a trap , she reminded him . 
If my father tries anything , it will definitely be a trap of some sort . The only question is , how is he trying to trap me ? He s tricky , and anything he does could be puppets or illusions , but he knows I m aware of his abilities , so he will mix it up . Some of the things will definitely be real . If he throws a fireball at me , there s a chance it could be an Illusion , but I m still going to have to dodge it or find out the hard way . If there s a change he s hurt Izuku ($_izuku) again I I can t stand by and do nothing . 
Then at least let me come with you , she said stubbornly . 
She s right , Shouto ($_shouto) . You shouldn t go alone , his mother told him . 
No , I need you all to hold down the castle in case he tries to attack here . If he gets to Shinsou , it s all over . Mother , you should go back to your dog form just in case . Save up your energy , I have a feeling we might need your help later . 
She looked reluctant , but complied anyways and took the form of a Schnauzer . Momo ($_momo) looked between them , torn . She wanted to follow her friend and mentor s instructions , but wanted to help as well . She tried to think of a plan , but before she could , Shouto ($_shouto) was heading to the door . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) , please think this through , she begged . 
No , I have to act now . Father ($_father) won t allow me any time to hesitate , he ($_father) said as he ($_father) rushed out the door . 
Endeavor wasn t above hurting Izuku ($_izuku) . He ($_father) d done it that day at the palace just to send a message , and Shouto ($_shouto) didn t want to find out how far he ($_father) would go . If Izuku ($_izuku) was alright and he ($_father) ran out here for nothing , it would just be a silly mistake . But , if his ($_father) boyfriend was in real trouble , he ($_father) had to act as soon as possible . What was his ($_father) father planning ? Hasn t Izuku ($_izuku) been hurt enough ? 
He ($_father) ran through the fields looking for green hair , but not seeing anything . Then he ($_father) noticed Uraraka ($_uraraka) by the safehouse . She was pushing the scarecrow towards the door , but he ($_father) seemed to not want to go in . Instead , the scarecrow was trying to run towards the castle . That was odd , but he ($_father) didn t have time to stop and think He ($_father) approached them , and they both stopped their squabble as they spotted him ($_father) . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) ? You re okay ? 
Of course , why wouldn t I be ? And where s Izuku ($_izuku) ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) ran ahead . He ($_izuku) asked me to make sure your All Might lookalike got back into the safehouse , but he ($_izuku) doesn t want to go ! 
I can not stand by while others get hurt ! The scarecrow yelled . 
Why did he ($_izuku) run ahead ? 
Your brother showed up and made us think you were in trouble ! But if you re here , than that means ... 
Dabi , the wizard cursed . Which way did Izuku ($_izuku) run ? 
He ($_izuku) went down this way , maybe we can still catch him ($_izuku) ! 
Shouto ($_shouto) ran with Uraraka ($_uraraka) down the pathway that Izuku ($_izuku) had taken , until he ($_izuku) rounded the corner and froze in place . Before him ($_izuku) he ($_izuku) saw Izuku ($_izuku) , but he ($_izuku) wasn t doing well . He ($_izuku) was fighting back tears , and is left arm looked broken . His ($_izuku) other arm was being held by Endeavor , who had used it to hoist him ($_izuku) off the ground . Izuku ($_izuku) struggled with a pained look on his ($_izuku) face , but as he ($_izuku) noticed Shouto ($_shouto) that expression turned to pure panic . Endeavor followed his ($_izuku) gaze and saw his ($_izuku) son , no more than fifteen feet away . He ($_izuku) smiled that same unsettling and creepy smile that Shouto ($_shouto) knew all too well . 
Shouto ($_shouto) , Izuku called out . Please! It s a trap , don t - 
Endeavor covered Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth before he ($_izuku) could finish the sentence , but Shouto ($_shouto) got the message . Trap or not , he ($_izuku) wasn t going to let his ($_izuku) father take away the man he ($_izuku) loved , especially before he ($_izuku) d gotten a chance to tell him ($_izuku) that . He ($_izuku) felt suddenly guilty for putting his ($_izuku) feelings off for so long . Why couldn t he ($_izuku) have just told Izuku ($_izuku) that morning ? I m going to get him ($_izuku) back and I ll tell him ($_izuku) then , he ($_izuku) resolved . He ($_izuku) took the first step forward and summoned a wall of ice around his ($_izuku) father and his ($_izuku) boyfriend . It blocked off all exits by foot , as he ($_izuku) surged towards them . Seeing this , Endeavor suddenly flew up into the air , taking Izuku ($_izuku) with him ($_izuku) . 
Izuku ($_izuku) struggled in his ($_izuku) arms , trying to escape even if it would mean falling from a great height . Shouto ($_shouto) knew he ($_izuku) could catch him ($_izuku) if he ($_izuku) fell , and he ($_izuku) wasn t worried . Still , he ($_izuku) had to be precise with his ($_izuku) attacks and pursuit so he ($_izuku) wouldn t cause Izuku ($_izuku) further injury . Where was his ($_izuku) father taking them ? They weren t headed towards the Todoroki family mansion , so where was Endeavor running to ? He ($_izuku) wasn t going to let him ($_izuku) get there , no matter what . 
Hang in there , Izuku ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) yelled after him ($_izuku) . I won t let him ($_izuku) take you .
