thinking , burying lamps in the deep solitude 
who are you , who are you ? 
Do you feel that ? 
Momo ($_momo) s hushed whisper came moments after Shouto ($_shouto) s senses began to prickle with awareness . He ($_shouto) tensed and looked to the woods , waiting to see if he ($_shouto) could feel or see more , but only darkness stared back at him ($_shouto) through the trees . It was close , just beyond the tree line , and he ($_shouto) shot Momo ($_momo) a wary look before saying , I feel it . 
She crowded closer to him ($_shouto) , her body practically vibrating with worry . Shouto ($_shouto) could feel her magic uncurling in preparation . Could it be them ? she whispered , It feels big . 
Big was an understatement . It felt huge , but shapeless and undefined . There was something off about it , but he couldn t pinpoint exactly what . And the fact that he couldn t sense who or what it was made him uneasy . Identifying the source would have to wait , because it was getting closer . Shit . He cast the net of his senses wider , pushing out the thin energy as far as it could reach without being detected . It s not them , he said , and Momo ($_momo) sagged in relief against him . But we need to move . 
He scanned their surroundings , trying to plan , and fast . They had a fire going , which was probably what alerted their company . Their chances of putting out the fire and shaking it off their trail was slim , so what could they do ? Dragging his eyes upwards , he scanned the treeline . Old colorwoods and vines grew overhead , but it was a bad place to do battle . If it had approached them earlier , they could have taken shelter under the Cantaba tree . As the energy got closer , he felt the tension close in around him . The woods beyond the light of their fire went silent . 
Where should we go ? Momo ($_momo) was already drawing up her hood , grabbing all the essential things that had been unpacked when they d started to settle in . There wasn t much to get from around their camp . A little food , some flatware , and their weapons were the only things not directly on their persons . She scooped the non-essentials into one of their bottomless bags and handed Shouto ($_shouto) his ($_shouto) knife . 
He ($_shouto) took it grimly , hating the weight of it in his ($_shouto) hand . Securing it to his ($_shouto) waist , he ($_shouto) stood , leaving the ring of light created by the fire . It s too dangerous to run into the woods , he ($_shouto) said quietly . She was close behind , her power a comforting presence next to him ($_shouto) . We don t know what their affinity is , so we re at a disadvantage . 
She hummed , and he ($_shouto) looked over . Her lips were pressed into a thin line , her brow knit with determination . Her hood cast deep , long shadows over her face , and he ($_shouto) felt a pang of regret . They used to spend their time studying and coming up with better and better ways to use their powers . Instead , they d given up their chance at peace and lived as fugitives . 
But he ($_shouto) set his ($_shouto) feelings aside and moved towards the edge of the small clearing . The perimeter was dotted with protection spells , but they were meant to turn travelers away , or confuse those who wished to harm them . They didn t stand a chance at this kind of power . He ($_shouto) felt them crumbling out of existence as the waves of power surged closer . 
Shouto ($_shouto) crouched in the shadows , and he ($_shouto) gestured for her ($_shouto) to come nearer . Our best bet is to wait for the fire to draw it near . Then we can trap it and flee . 
There was a tree she ($_shouto) started , but he ($_shouto) made a gesture to quiet her ($_shouto) . It was really close . Close enough to hear them if it wanted . 
So they waited . 
The woods were deathly silent around them , and even the crackling of the fire lost volume . Everything was muted , tense , ready and they sat with baited breath . Shouto ($_shouto) focused on his ($_shouto) breathing , making it ($_shouto) even and deep . His ($_shouto) power coiled inside of him ($_shouto) , ready to strike . 
Then , the power disappeared , rushing away from them so quickly it left a ringing in their ears . Momo ($_momo) made a sound of surprise and stumbled , and Shouto ($_shouto) moved back with her ($_shouto) . His ($_momo) heart was pounding in his ($_momo) chest , and he ($_momo) willed it to slow . If the power was gone , surely the threat had passed . 
But there was something else Shouto ($_shouto) strained his ($_shouto) ears to hear it , his ($_shouto) hand on the hilt of his ($_shouto) blade just in case . 
A voice called out in the darkness , cutting through the ringing . Hello? 
Momo and Shouto ($_shouto) shared a look . They didn t reply . Everyone knew not to reply to voices in the woods . 
But then a person followed , stumbling into their clearing , looking out of place and disheveled . Momo ($_momo) tensed behind him ($_momo) , and he ($_momo) felt her readying an attack . The protection spells were gone . They were on their own . 
It s not right . Shouto ($_shouto) thought , watching the person gaze around the clearing , their eyes wide with panic . His ($_shouto) energy began to ebb , and he ($_shouto) let it go dormant . His ($_shouto) sense of dread began to pass . 
Hello! the stranger called out . They were young , probably similar in age to the two of them , maybe a little younger . Their clothing was weird and inadequate . Their arms and legs were exposed , and they were hugging their arms to their chest , fighting off the cold . Their eyes darted to the fire , then to the rest of the clearing . A wary look passed over their face , and they went to the fire slowly . 
A foreigner ? He felt Momo ($_momo) shift in response to his thought , but didn t get a reply . Communicating words , and even just impressions , with magic could be cumbersome . He glanced at Momo ($_momo) and said under his breath , Watch me , I m going to talk to them . 
Are you wild ? she hissed under her breath , her eyes gleaming from beneath her hood . 
Shouto ($_shouto) looked from her to the stranger , who was tentatively making their way to the fire , then shrugged . I don t feel it any more , do you ? The stranger sat where they d been sitting only moments before , and held their hands towards the flames . They slouched into the warmth and sighed gratefully . 
She bit her lip , frowned , then shook her head . You know as well as I do 
If it s a trap , it already has us . He said , then he stood from the shadows , dropping the protection of the dark as he stepped into the firelight again . He kept his hand on his weapon and drew himself up to his full height . Who are you ? 
The stranger yelped , jumped , then when they saw Shouto ($_shouto) their surprise melted into an expression of pure relief . Oh , thank god , they said . They smiled and stood , saying , My friends call me Deku ($_deku) . I m so glad to see you . 
Shouto ($_shouto) sniffed , studying the stranger from head to toe . They were shorter than him ($_shouto) , but not by much . Their hair was a mess of uneven curls , framing their face and sticking out like a dark halo around their features . It was an uncommon color , even for their region dark green , similar to their eyes . The stranger didn t look at Shouto ($_shouto) s weapon , and seemed either unaware or unphased by his ($_shouto) obviously defensive posture . Curious , Shouto ($_shouto) waited for them to continue . 
Um , the stranger Deku shifted their weight , then asked in a nervous voice , Can you , ah , can you tell me where I am ? 
Surprise made Shouto ($_shouto) go rigid . Not even a proper introduction ? It didn t seem like a trick , and all traces of magic had left the clearing . This person didn t have any power , they were just lost . 
Where do you think you are ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked cautiously . 
Honestly I have no idea , they replied , looking up to to the tree line . Last thing I remember I was taking a nap under the big tree on the library lawn , and now I m here . They reached into their pocket , and Shouto ($_shouto) tensed . Deku ($_deku) pulled out a small , polished square . It was unlike anything Shouto ($_shouto) had seen before , it was so uniform in design and color . I m not getting any service out here , so I can t even call someone to pick me up , they said , touching the stone . It lit up , and Shouto ($_shouto) took a step back . It was a summoning stone , but it , like its owner , bore no trace of magical power . He felt Momo ($_momo) s surprise and frowned . For her to not recognize a magical artifact was unheard of , and he stared hard at the stranger . 
Who are you , really ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked again , Introduce yourself , properly . He ($_shouto) tried to use a commanding tone , but it felt cheap and unnatural . 
Deku ($_deku) mirrored his ($_deku) frown , and seemed to finally take stock of him ($_deku) . Their calculated gaze piqued Shouto ($_shouto) s curiosity . So they re not completely stupid , he ($_deku) thought , resisting the urge to let his ($_deku) power unfold , just a little . He ($_deku) was always taught that showing his ($_deku) strength was the only way remind others of his ($_deku) authority . 
But he ($_deku) wasn t home , and his ($_deku) place was now nowhere . He ($_deku) had no authority , and certainly bore no rank above Deku ($_deku) . 
I told you . their voice was measured , careful . Their eyes flickered to the hand he ($_deku) rested on his ($_deku) weapon and he ($_deku) said , I m Deku . 
Where are you from ? 
Tokai . 
The name was unfamiliar to Shouto , and he ($_deku) shook his ($_deku) head . What s you affinity ? 
Deku ($_deku) stared at him ($_deku) , ran a hand through their hair . My what ? they sounded exasperated and tired , and Shouto ($_shouto) was beginning to think they really weren t a threat at all . 
The anticipatory feeling left in the wake of that power wouldn t leave , however , and Shouto ($_shouto) still felt on edge . Everything is connected . He was determined to figure out what the stranger and the power had in common . 
I have no idea what you re talking about , Deku ($_deku) said , dropping their arms . Please just tell me where we are . 
An idea came to him slowly . They d passed a Cantaba ($_cantaba) tree on their way to their camp , and while it was uncommon , travelling by Cantaba ($_cantaba) wasn t impossible . He met the stranger s eyes , letting a little of his power seep out of him , just to make them more willing to reply . It was an old trick that only worked on those without much energy , or on those that couldn t sense the magical pressure . 
The stranger shifted uncomfortably , whether under his gaze or his power , he wasn t sure . He crossed his arms , acting like he was scanning them up and down again , but let out a little more power . Ah , there . Deku ($_deku) shifted again , taking a step back this time , Not completely magicless . 
We re in Musutafu , Shouto ($_shouto) said finally . 
Deku ($_deku) didn t really react , they just frowned . After a long beat , they sat down by the fire and said , I have no idea where that is . They sat close to the stone ring on a short fallen log , folding in on themself to get warm . I have no idea where I am , or why it s so dark , or how I ended up in the woods . Dropping their head into their hands , they said , I must be dreaming . 
He felt Momo ($_momo) cast a question towards him , but it was just the feeling of questioning that made it to him . He sighed , some people could communicate naturally without words , but for others it took a lifetime to master . He turned away from Deku ($_deku) , feeling secure in his ability to defend himself if it all ended up being a trick anyway . Momo ($_momo) , he beckoned . 
She stood , dropping the shroud that had been hiding them both earlier . Deku ($_deku) jumped when they saw her . Wh-what ? Where? they stammered . 
She held up her hand in a simple traveler s greeting , and introduced herself properly , though not completely honestly . My name is Momo ($_momo) , I come from the east , my affinity is creation , though it is simple and weak . She gestured to Shouto , indicating that they were equals with the movement , This is Shouto ($_shouto) . He is from the North , and his affinity is water . 
It is mild , and new , he added . These introductions were protections they d crafted together . They were simple , with a part of the truth shielded by lies . It had taken them a long time to figure out how to doctor their introductions , but they d managed . Everything in their presentation , from their greeting to their dress and their appearances , was to protect them . 
Deku ($_deku) blinked up at them , obviously uncomprehending . Nice to meet you ($_deku) , they said flatly , then dropped their head into their hands again . They muttered something under their breath that Shouto couldn t hear over the crackling of the fire . 
Shouto ($_shouto) took a seat near Deku ($_deku) , then gestured for Momo ($_momo) to sit on the other side of the fire . He ($_shouto) looked at her , wanting her to know to stay on guard , but that they had the situation under control . 
She gave him ($_shouto) a pinched , uncertain look but sat on the other side anyway . 
Deku ($_deku) didn t seem to notice their exchange , they just rubbed their hand over their summoning stone . It didn t light up . Shouto ($_shouto) wondered where it came from . 
He ($_shouto) opened his ($_shouto) mouth to ask about it , and to ask about how they had traveled , but the rushing power returned to the clearing , making him ($_shouto) recoil . The power was so strong it made his ($_shouto) head spin , and a thrumming sound filled his ($_shouto) ears . He ($_shouto) leaned back , unintentionally putting space between him ($_shouto) and Deku ($_deku) , and felt Momo ($_momo) s shock from across the fire . 
Something caught his ($_shouto) eye . 
Deku ($_deku) wasn t paying attention , and didn t seem to feel the great energy roaring through the small clearing . They were still looking at the polished summoning stone , turning it over in their hands and tapping the sides in mild annoyance . 
But on their side , on the seam of their shirt , there was a leaf sticking to the fabric . 
What is that? Shouto ($_shouto) asked , his ($_shouto) voice tight . He ($_shouto) was reaching out before Deku ($_deku) s attention returned to him ($_shouto) , and he ($_shouto) reached behind their arm to the soft material . Deku ($_deku) inhaled sharply and froze when Shouto ($_shouto) reached them . 
Shouto ($_shouto) plucked the leaf from his ($_shouto) fingers , the fabric soft and warm to his ($_shouto) touch . Deku ($_deku) stiffened at the contact , as they should . Shouto ($_shouto) was reaching for the area over their ribs , close to the underside of their breast . With a well-placed strike , Shouto ($_shouto) could have put his ($_shouto) blade to their heart . 
His ($_shouto) own heart pounded as he ($_shouto) drew the leaf close to examine it . Between his ($_shouto) fingers , it quivered with an energy that made him ($_shouto) light headed . 
Cantaba ($_cantaba) leaves couldn t be harvested . Rarely did they fall . They were prized for their magical properties , which were vast , and were incredibly rare . The tree s power kept them securely to the branch , and tended to leave those who tried to poach them cursed . 
Leaves fell from the Cantaba ($_cantaba) tree perhaps once every thousand years . 
And yet , here was this stranger , appearing in a great rush of power , with a leaf stuck to their shirt . They hadn t even realized it was there . 
Shouto ($_shouto) dragged his ($_shouto) eyes from the leaf to Deku , who was watching him ($_shouto) with a wary kind of curiosity . Holding it between them , he ($_shouto) asked , his ($_shouto) voice tight , Who are you ? 
I told you their eyes dropped to the leaf , their brows drawn together in confusion . 
Not your name , Momo ($_momo) interrupted . Her voice was dazed , too , Who you are . 
Deku ($_deku) threw their hands up in frustration , I ($_deku) honestly don t know what you want from me ($_deku) . I ($_deku) told you where I ($_deku) m from and what you can call me ($_deku) . I ($_deku) don t know where I ($_deku) am , who you are , or what and affinity is . All I ($_deku) want is to get home . 
We ll help you , Shouto ($_shouto) said , without thinking . As the words from his ($_shouto) mouth reached his ($_shouto) brain , his ($_shouto) heart began to sink . Why did he ($_shouto) offer their help ? They were in no position to help someone else . They were busy enough keeping themselves out of danger . Assisting someone who was connected to a power Shouto couldn t yet understand and who had no idea how to take care of themself was a bad idea . 
It was so terrible , in fact , that Momo ($_momo) s voice rang through his ($_momo) head as clear as if she had spoken : We can t help him ($_momo) . 
He ($_momo) ignored her and tucked the Cantaba ($_cantaba) leaf into a pocket in his ($_momo) shirt . He ($_momo) didn t think much about where to put it , and slipped it into the pocket closest to his ($_momo) heart . His ($_momo) clothing , like everything else they carried , was spelled for discretion . The leaf would make them stand out to those who wished to harness power for themselves , but with the help of Momo ($_momo) s spelled clothing , he ($_momo) could keep it hidden . They could reinforce the concealments later . 
Oh , thank god , Deku ($_deku) said , visibly relieved . They smiled , Thank you so much , I am really grateful . 
We can t guarantee that you ll get home , Momo ($_momo) said softly , shooting a warning glance to Shouto . It s obvious to us that you re not from here , and while we ll help you the best that we can , there are certain things we re restricted from doing . 
Looking puzzled , Deku ($_deku) said , Honestly if you can just get me to a phone or a train station I can figure it out from there . I can t be too far from campus . They tapped a finger on their chin as they looked around , and murmured , There s a forested park not too far from school , that s probably where I am 
Momo and Shouto ($_shouto) exchanged a look . There were no phones or train stations . They didn t even know what those were . 
We can get you somewhere safer than here , Shouto ($_shouto) said , his ($_shouto) brain kicking into gear . They could take him ($_shouto) to the nearest town and leave him ($_shouto) be , or they could take him ($_shouto) to somebody that would know about traveling via Cantaba ($_cantaba) tree . Both were risky . 
And Momo ($_momo) looked over their guest consideringly , And we can outfit you more appropriately for the weather . She pursed his lips , obviously troubled by the turn of events . 
Shouto ($_shouto) stood and retrieved the small , soft container he ($_shouto) used for water and gave it to Deku , who took it happily . Thank you , I don t have much , since I m lost , but I can repay you by helping in whatever way I can . 
Without sitting down , Shouto ($_shouto) frowned and moved closer to Momo . He ($_shouto) gestured for her and told Deku ($_deku) , Help yourself to the water . We ll get you something warmer . 
Thanks ! They said brightly , inching closer to the fire . 
Shouto ($_shouto) dragged Momo ($_momo) away and put up a wall of energy that would keep Deku ($_deku) from hearing them . As soon as it was up , Momo ($_momo) placed herself squarely in front of him ($_momo) and hissed , What are you thinking ? 
Wordlessly , he ($_momo) pulled the Cantaba ($_cantaba) leaf from his ($_momo) pocket and held it up for her to examine . 
She gasped and reached for it , but stopped herself before touching it . He ($_momo) watched as she stared at it and saw her shudder , as if she d cast her senses to it . They had that ? 
It was stuck to their shirt , he ($_momo) said , shaking his ($_momo) head . Of all the ways to stumble across a powerful object , it was by accident . He ($_momo) traced the shape of it with his ($_momo) eye , outlining the simple , oblong shape with its two lobes and jagged edges . It was bright green , a recent fall . 
This means something , she said seriously . 
Shouto ($_shouto) nodded in agreement . What do you think this means for us ? 
She shook her head , I don t know . I don t even know where we can start with this . Sighing , she glanced to where Deku ($_deku) said by the fire , then shook her head again . That power we felt , could it have just been the leaf ? 
I have no idea , he said honestly , tucking it away in his pocket again . I ve never seen one before , and I m sure the records of them are long gone . 
Momo ($_momo) watched it disappear into his ($_momo) pocket , then said , I ll need to increase the protections on your clothing , if that s how you re going to carry it . 
He ($_momo) nodded , And we should shroud Deku ($_deku) , just in case the power is more related to them than the leaf . 
That s a good idea , she said . Then she crouched , opening her cloak enough to work . Do you think they need a disguise ? 
No . I haven t detected any dishonestly from them , have you ? When she shook her head , he ($_momo) shrugged . They re not from here , so the chances of them being recognized are slim . Focus on shrouding that power , if you can . He ($_momo) wasn t sure if they could really hide it , since it d ripped through their wards in an instant . That kind of power would be a beacon to the ones that pursued them . 
She nodded and began to pull a shirt from the exposed skin of her stomach . There was a glow as it came into existence , and she dropped it on the ground before creating a pair of pants and a poncho . They re similar in size to you , she said , gathering up all the fabric . I made things a little shorter , but hopefully they fit . They re as spelled as your clothes are , with added protections against uncontrolled magic . 
I m sure they re fine , Shouto ($_shouto) said honestly . Momo ($_momo) s affinity for creation was more than just strong , it was honed and studied . She could size a person up with one look , and needed minimal time to weave both fabric and spells . Her talents were strongest in fusing creation with spellcraft . No one could create like her . 
I ll need to reinforce your wards , she said , placing a hand on his chest . Modifying the structure of things she d created already was a new skill , but one she was improving on the daily . The fabric of his shirt , now home to the Cantaba ($_cantaba) leaf and a number of layered protections , grew warm under her touch . He felt the weight of its magic shift and grow tighter between the cords of fiber holding it all together . It was comforting , warm , and relaxing against his skin . 
He gave her as much of a smile as he could muster and said , Thank you , Momo ($_momo) . I know this isn t what we planned . 
She smiled at him , touching his shoulder reassuringly , and said , We may not have planned it , but the Cantaba did . 
Shouto ($_shouto) swallowed , humbled by her insight , and nodded . He ($_shouto) took the things from her hands so that she could rest , and went back to the fire . 
Deku ($_deku) didn t know what to make of his ($_deku) two caretakers . 
He ($_deku) d closed his ($_deku) eyes under the Diosa ($_diosa) tree on campus , intending to take a quick afternoon nap between classes , but had awoken in a dark forest at night . He ($_deku) d stumbled around for a couple of hours before getting pulled in the direction of the fire . His ($_deku) thoughts had been turning desperate , but he ($_deku) found the two of them just in time . 
And it had felt like he ($_deku) had been pulled in that direction , his ($_deku) gut leading him ($_deku) more than his ($_deku) sense of place . When he ($_deku) d seen the fire , he ($_deku) d never been more relieved . The woods were cold , humid , and disorienting . Seeing the two of them emerge from the dark had been frightening but reassuring . 
But things were getting stranger and stranger . He ($_deku) touched the material of his ($_deku) new clothing , which they d said had been spelled for his ($_deku) protection . There was an interesting weight to it , and he ($_deku) felt hyper aware of the movement of the material against his ($_deku) skin . He ($_deku) d changed out of his ($_deku) shorts and tee shirt , which were as far from appropriate outdoor wear as he ($_deku) could have gotten , and gladly put on what had been provided to him ($_deku) . Even the poncho , which he ($_deku) d found a bit curious , was warm and practical . 
His ($_deku) clothes were similar to theirs . Everything they wore was in earthtones . Dark brown pants , tan linen shirt , a dark woollen poncho , it was all practical and a bit drab . 
They themselves were a bit drab and plain . 
Momo ($_momo) had dark hair and eyes that were flat and unassuming . Her face was round and her expression was neutral whenever he ($_momo) found himself ($_momo) looking at her . She was average height , reasonably young , and just normal . If he ($_momo) d passed her on the street , he ($_momo) wouldn t have paid her any mind . 
There was a walking stick next to where she sat and a bag that kept drawing his eye . Every time he tried to look a little closer at her , he found his eyes instead on the bag . It was a deep purple , so dark it was almost black , and slung across her body . He felt like he needed to know what was in it . But she seemed quiet and nice enough . 
Shouto ($_shouto) was equally plain . He was of average height and build , with startlingly average features . His eyes were a dull grey , his hair an ashy , reddish brown . His mouth was constantly in a hard line , and his body one tense moment . He looked stiff , as if he were waiting to be scolded for his posture at any moment . 
Despite their plain appearance , Deku ($_deku) wasn t sure about them . The person who had greeted him when he d stumbled into the clearing was too commanding , too authoritative . The person who sat near him was reserved and mild . They both seemed too plain , too unremarkable . It was almost engineered . 
It was a feeling he couldn t shake , even after they clothed and fed him . Their conversation was bland and terse , and he got the sense that they didn t want to answer too many questions . They told him that they would take him to a nearby town and send him on the way in the morning . It was as much help as he could have hoped for . 
His options were to tag along with these too-plain people or pick his way back through the woods to the Diosa tree . Finding a single tree in the woods would be impossible , but if he could find it on his own , maybe he could find his way back . 
He d learned as a child that the Diosa ($_diosa) tree would always guide him , which is why he tended to gravitate towards the one on campus . But all the little addages his mother had taught him couldn t have prepared him for this . And it couldn t have prepared him for Shouto ($_shouto) s reaction to the Diosa leaf . To him , they were a mild irritation . They ended up in all of his stuff , all the time , getting tracked in on his shoes or the cuffs of his jeans or even on the back of his coat . He was constantly finding them in his room and in his belongings . 
But Shouto ($_shouto) had acted as if he ($_shouto) d never seen one in his ($_shouto) life . Deku ($_deku) filed the reaction away for later , along with the weird feelings he ($_deku) had towards his ($_deku) hosts . They were helping him ($_deku) , so he ($_deku) had no reason to distrust them , but felt like they were hiding information from him ($_deku) . 
Of course they are , he ($_deku) told himself ($_deku) , You re a stranger . 
He ($_deku) stared down at the plate of food he ($_deku) had been given . It was simple , a few pieces of roasted meat and some greens that had been cooked in a pan over the fire . He ($_deku) picked at the greens , turning them over and thinking that they looked familiar . 
Wait , he ($_deku) said without thinking , squinting at the worn tin plate . He ($_deku) withdrew his ($_deku) hand and shook the plate , moving them around . Shouto and Momo ($_momo) looked up from their own quiet meal . After they d gotten him ($_deku) set up with clothes , they d pooled a portion of their provisions for a modest dinner . 
They glanced up at him ($_deku) , eyeing him ($_deku) warily . 
He ($_deku) frowned and looked between them and the plate , Is this sunvetch ? Using his ($_deku) utensil , he ($_deku) folded them over , looking more closely at the bundles of small cooked leaves . The meal was plain but smelled good . There was a large portion of the greens , which had been cooked in the pan after a small amount of meat had been browned and served . 
The two of them shared a sharp look , their eyes locking in an instant . That was another thing that had been bothering him ($_deku) . It seemed like they could communicate entire conversations with a single look . It didn t sit quite right with him ($_deku) . He ($_deku) felt like he ($_deku) was at a disadvantage . 
Yes , Momo ($_momo) said , glancing down at her plate . It s sunvetch . She brought her eyes back up to meet his ($_deku) , Do you know it ? 
Deku ($_deku) took a bite and chewed slowly , letting himself ($_deku) get familiar with the flavor . It was crunchy and fine , like alfalfa , but had a flavor more similar to kale . He ($_deku) liked it , and it was exactly as his ($_deku) mother had described . Sighing when he ($_deku) finished the bite , he ($_deku) looked up to their expectant gazes and said , No , I ve never had it . 
They stared at him ($_deku) , and a creeping sensation tickled over his ($_deku) skin . It was so weird , like going through one of the full-body scanners at the airport . He ($_deku) felt like he ($_deku) was being stripped and examined . He ($_deku) shook the feeling and took another bite . 
It s good , isn t it ? Momo ($_momo) said slowly . She pushed her food around her plate with her utensil , which was a very short-tined fork with a stumpy handle . It seemed good for camping , but not for much else . It s a common edible , and is often a side dish or an ingredient in main dishes . 
Shouto ($_shouto) was watching Deku ($_deku) s face , but he ($_shouto) ignored him ($_shouto) in favor of listening to Momo . He ($_shouto) tried to make light conversation , What else is it used in ? 
Simple dishes , mostly , Momo ($_momo) said . Like this . It s common and nutritious , and easy to harvest . 
It s endemic to this region , Shouto ($_shouto) added . He ($_shouto) was staring at Deku ($_deku) , his ($_shouto) gaze boring right into him ($_shouto) . Are you sure you haven t had it before ? 
Deku ($_deku) lowered his ($_deku) plate to his ($_deku) lap and looked carefully at Shouto ($_shouto) . Most of Shouto ($_shouto) s plate was untouched , and the sunvetch was pushed to one side , far from the meat . Deku ($_deku) took that piece of information and filed it along with the rest of his ($_deku) observations . He ($_deku) was still as lost as he ($_deku) could be , so he ($_deku) was hoarding all the information he ($_deku) could . He ($_deku) found himself ($_deku) becoming more interested in the sunvetch as Shouto ($_shouto) stared at him ($_deku) , I m sure . We don t have it where I m from . he ($_deku) said softly , and left it at that . 
They ate in silence for a while , but Deku ($_deku) could feel their glances at him ($_deku) and even to each other . When they d finished , Shouto ($_shouto) stood up and silently collected their plates . Momo and Deku ($_deku) gave him ($_deku) a quiet thanks before he ($_deku) vanished into the dark . 
Once they were alone , Deku ($_deku) looked to Momo and asked her , Can you tell me more about affinities ? 
Giving him ($_deku) a puzzled look , she asked him ($_deku) , Do you really not know what they are ? 
I really don t. 
Interesting , she said , but didn t elaborate . Then she gestured generally , Affinities are our magical specialties . 
M - magical ? he ($_deku) sputtered , not expecting that in the least . When they d done their weird introductions , he ($_deku) thought they were talking about their areas of study or something like their zodiac signs . The experience was beginning to feel more and more like a dream . 
Looking at him ($_deku) quizzically , she nodded , Yes . Most people in Musutafu have an affinity . There are hundreds of them , though , so I can t get too far into the details there . 
You said yours was creation , when you introduced yourself . 
Yes , and our introductions are special , she said . There are rules about what we can and can t say , and the introductions are usually bestowed upon us by our teachers . 
Teachers ? 
Most people hone their affinity under a teacher , during a long apprenticeship . We can t just make up our introductions , they re given to us . Her lips pursed and she searched his face , as if looking for an answer . Whatever she was after , she couldn t find , so she went on . That s why we asked for your proper introduction . It s almost impossible to fake those , because it s such old magic . 
Huh_,_Deku ($_deku) pinched the bridge of his ($_deku) nose in thought . He ($_deku) was dreaming , there was no other answer . He ($_deku) d been stressed lately , about his ($_deku) studies and recent inability to focus . All of his ($_deku) dreams in the previous few weeks had been weird , but this was the most detailed and bizzare . Okay , he ($_deku) said after a moment , Thanks for explaining it . I ($_i) don t really understand it and I ($_i) have a lot more questions , but I ($_i) think for now I ($_i) d just like to rest . 
She nodded understandingly , then said , Tomorrow we ll have to figure out how you can introduce yourself . But when Shouto returns we can set you up with a place to sleep . 
Thanks , he ($_deku) said . Then , because he ($_deku) always had to ask questions as they popped into his ($_deku) head , he ($_deku) said , Wait , didn t you say those introductions are hard to fake ? 
She looked at him ($_deku) consideringly , as if her opinion of him ($_deku) were in flux . They are , but because you have no affinity you won t have to fake it . We will give you one . 
It wasn t a very satisfying answer , but it would hold him ($_deku) over until the morning . At that moment , Shouto ($_shouto) returned from the woods , his ($_shouto) hands wet and the plates drip drying as he ($_shouto) made his ($_shouto) way back to the circle . He ($_shouto) stacked them neatly on the stone ring protecting the fire and crouched on his ($_shouto) heels . I m ready for bed , he ($_shouto) said , to no one in particular . He ($_shouto) was looking into the fire , a tense frown on his ($_shouto) face . 
Deku ($_deku) looked from the fire to Momo , who was nodding . Should I put out the fire ? he ($_shouto) asked . 
Why? Shouto ($_shouto) asked , lifting an eyebrow but not looking away from the flames . 
Uh , Deku ($_deku) glanced between the two of them , then asked , Aren t you worried about forest fires ? It was a decent size fire , big enough to cook on , and the clearing was small . The flames crackled happily , seemingly amused by the prospect . 
Shouto ($_shouto) laughed , and it was so unexpected that Deku ($_deku) s mouth dropped open . The forest only burns when it wants to , he ($_shouto) said plainly . 
Momo ($_momo) glanced between the two of them , then said , Where would you like them to sleep ? 
Deku ($_deku) perked up at the use of the them in reference to him ($_deku) . He ($_deku) d always kind of liked how it felt , and decided that the two of them could do that or use him ($_deku) as a pronoun . They were both adequate and he ($_deku) generally let people do what was easiest . A bright pleasure blossomed in the pit of his ($_deku) stomach because most of the time , the masculine was the default . He ($_deku) wouldn t correct them . 
Well , Shouto ($_shouto) turned his ($_shouto) eyes to him ($_shouto) , then said , We have two tents . Would you prefer to sleep with me , Momo ($_momo) , or outside ? 
He ($_deku) looked from the two of them to the sky , which was dark and cloudy . Outside of the ring of warmth created by the fire , it was getting colder and colder . The thought of being exposed to the elements and all of the wildlife did not sound appealing . He ($_deku) definitely wanted to sleep in one of the tents , but wanted to think about who he ($_deku) would sleep next to . 
It felt like Shouto ($_shouto) was lying to him ($_deku) the most , hiding the most . So he ($_deku) picked him ($_deku) . I ll bunk with you , if that s alright , he ($_deku) told him ($_deku) . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s eyebrows lifted in a brief expression of surprise , then he ($_deku) said , Fine . My things are over here , you can help me set up . 
Deku ($_deku) dutifully rose to help , grateful for the new clothing as he ($_deku) left the fire s warmth . He ($_deku) wondered how well he ($_deku) would sleep , and how much time he ($_deku) would spend awake . He ($_deku) thought he ($_deku) could get answers that night . His ($_deku) mother always used to tell him ($_deku) that no one could lie while they slept .
