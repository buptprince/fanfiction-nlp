They ve only been flying for a few hours when Shouto ($_shouto) notices that Bakugou ($_bakugou) s wings aren t beating quite as steadily anymore . 
When they d set off -- first landing again to fashion a makeshift saddle so Shouto ($_shouto) didn t rub his ($_shouto) legs raw on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s sharp scales -- he ($_shouto) d been secretly glad Bakugou ($_bakugou) would be the one to carry him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) didn t like the idea of relying so much on someone who he ($_shouto) had just met , much less being strapped to their back as they hurtled through the sky . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was familiar . He ($_shouto) knew Bakugou ($_bakugou) , how to piss him ($_shouto) off , how to calm him ($_shouto) down , when to give up and hide until the explosions died down 
He ($_shouto) knew Bakugou ($_bakugou) would never admit it , but after being stuck in a tower together for a decade , they d had no choice but to become friends . 
It s this unspoken friendship that prompts Shouto ($_shouto) to lean forward and whack Bakugou ($_bakugou) on the neck . 
The fuck do you want ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) yells . It s not as fierce as it usually is : a little quieter , a little more out of breath . 
I dropped my pocketknife , Shouto ($_shouto) shouts back . 
Am I supposed to give a shit ? 
Can we stop to find it ? 
Fucking_Bakugou ($_bakugou) takes a breath . He ($_bakugou) sounds more winded with every word . Stopping for a fucking pocketknife . Seriously. 
It s a very important pocketknife , Shouto ($_shouto) says placidly . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) knows he ($_bakugou) has plenty of sharp things that could take the place of a pocketknife . He ($_bakugou) d watched him ($_bakugou) pack . He ($_bakugou) also knows that every year upon his ($_bakugou) birthday , a large shipment of every sort of weapon in the appropriate size was delivered to the tower , and that Shouto ($_shouto) never viewed them with any sort of sentimentality . 
But above all , Bakugou ($_bakugou) knows that he ($_bakugou) is not going to last much longer , and that a search for a pocketknife provides a convenient excuse for a rest . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) doesn t say anything . His ($_bakugou) muscles are clearly on the point of exhaustion , though , and Shouto ($_shouto) sits back , confident in the knowledge that Bakugou ($_bakugou) s mind is made up . 
We re heading down ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) roars before tucking his ($_bakugo) wings in and diving . Midoriya and Shinsou ($_shinsou) hang above them in the sky for a split second before they too tip into dives . 
Midoriya rockets past them , an aerodynamically perfect green blur . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) grumbles something lost in the slipstream . It probably involves lots of swearing . 
Through all of this , Shouto ($_shouto) is clinging on for dear life , the wind slicing over his ($_shouto) skin like knives . Through blurry eyes , he ($_shouto) sees the faint blur of the ground resolving into things like rocks and trees and shouldn t Bakugou ($_bakugou) be pulling out of the dive about now ? 
Muscles shift beneath him ($_shouto) and suddenly Bakugou ($_bakugou) is doing exactly that . Shouto ($_shouto) pitches forwards , forearms hitting scales and head hitting forearms . 
Ow . 
Maybe he ($_shouto) should get a helmet or something . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) comes out of the dive higher and gentler than either Midoriya or Shinsou ($_shinsou) , both of whom fall farther before snapping their wings open and levelling out . They drift down from there , soft as feathers on the breeze . 
When they land , Midoriya ($_midoriya) immediately rushes up , concern plain in his ($_midoriya) eyes , and asks , What s wrong ? 
I dropped something , Shouto ($_shouto) says , stepping over the row of spikes to his ($_shouto) side and preparing to make his ($_shouto) way down Bakugou ($_bakugou) s leg . He ($_shouto) ll have to be careful to avoid the sharp hooks sprouting from his ($_shouto) elbows , as well . 
... Bakugou didn t seem nearly this tall when he ($_shouto) first climbed into the saddle . 
We stopped half a day before we were supposed to because the princeling dropped something ? Shinsou ($_shinsou) says , curling his ($_shinsou) lip . 
Shouto ($_shouto) shrugs . It ($_shouto) was a very important item . 
Like what ? 
A pocketknife . 
Midoriya_,_who_had_also_seen_him_pack ($_midoriya) him ($_shinsou) pack , opens his ($_shinsou) mouth . 
Shouto ($_shouto) shoots him ($_shinsou) a cold glare . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) shuts his ($_midoriya) mouth . 
He ($_midoriya) glances at Bakugou , who s now flat on the ground , eyelids drooping and tongue lolling . Even the habitual sparking around his ($_midoriya) flared horns is gone . 
Shouto ($_shouto) can t help but wince in sympathy . If he ($_midoriya) s not even bothering to keep up the usual small explosions , he ($_midoriya) must really be worn out . 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) draws himself ($_shinsou) up , ready to deliver what will no doubt be a blistering diatribe , when Midoriya ($_midoriya) speaks again . 
You know , I m getting a little tired , he ($_midoriya) says , faking a yawn . Maybe we should rest for a bit while Todoroki searches . 
... you flew for three days straight on the way down . 
Then I guess it s catching up to me . He ($_midoriya) pokes at his ($_midoriya) harness with a claw until it s loose enough to wiggle free before promptly shifting . He ($_midoriya) clasps his ($_midoriya) hands together and stretches his ($_midoriya) arms up , twisting from side to side . His ($_midoriya) back cracks . 
But -- we can t stop now , it ll throw the whole schedule off -- 
Shouto doesn t bother to pay any further attention to their argument . It s clear Midoriya ($_midoriya) s going to wear Shinsou ($_shinsou) down . 
Instead , he ($_midoriya) nudges Bakugou ($_bakugou) s leg . Shift . 
I don t need to fuckin shift , we ll be back up in just a second -- 
Shift or I m telling Shinsou ($_shinsou) about the time you got your head stuck in a sword rack . 
Silence . 
... asshole . 
Shouto ($_shouto) nods to himself ($_shouto) in satisfaction . He ($_shouto) steps away from Bakugou ($_bakugou) once he ($_shouto) feels the scales at his ($_shouto) back ripple , signalling the shift . 
Don ($_don) t forget , I ($_don) have so much shit on you too , Bakugou ($_bakugou) mutters . 
Shouto ($_shouto) just shrugs . 
On the other side of the clearing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) seems to have finally won the argument by simply flopping down on the ground and falling asleep . 
Impressive, really. 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) s given up , resorting to pacing irritably at the edge of the trees . His ($_shouto) tail has left a rather nice wavy pattern in the dirt behind him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) doesn t seem like he ($_shouto) ll make any more effort to continue . 
Good. 
Now that Shouto ($_shouto) s on the ground , it s sunk in a little more -- 
He ($_shouto) s free . 
Sure , he ($_shouto) s still tethered to Bakugou , but for the first time in a decade , he ($_shouto) s not surrounded by worn stone walls . The forest around him ($_shouto) is thick , yes , but there s clear sky above his ($_shouto) head , birdsong echoing in his ($_shouto) ears , and no locked doors to be found . 
Shouto ($_shouto) slips a hand into his ($_shouto) pocket , fingering the pocketknife he ($_shouto) s supposed to have lost . 
He ($_shouto) has nothing to search for but the horizon . 
He ($_shouto) sets off into the forest , a grin tugging at the corners of his ($_shouto) lips 
-RRB- |(
Have you found your knife yet ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) looks up from his ($_shouto) book , brows knitted in confusion . What? 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) sighs . Your knife ? The reason we re wasting time here ? 
Oh, right. 
Shouto ($_shouto) glances at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . He ($_shouto) s still out cold , has been since Shouto ($_shouto) found his ($_shouto) way back and sat down with a book . A half-empty bag of mysterious jerky lies by his ($_shouto) head . Midoriya ($_midoriya) had claimed it replenished a vast amount of energy , but as it had a smell vaguely reminiscent of rat droppings , Shouto ($_shouto) decided to give it a pass . 
...not yet. 
Aren t you going to look for it , then ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) turns the page . Why bother? It s probably stuck in some tree a mile back , with how fast we were traveling . 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) stares at him ($_shouto) . 
Do you mind ? I ve just gotten to the good part , Shouto ($_shouto) says , not looking up . 
How much shit has Bakugou had to put up with the last ten years ? Shinsou ($_shinsou) says , aghast . 
I wouldn t know . I ve certainly never been any trouble . 
Shouto ($_shouto) feels the weight of Shinsou ($_shinsou) s incredulous gaze on him ($_shouto) , growing heavier by the second , assumedly accompanied by a rush of sympathy for Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) mutters something to himself ($_shinsou) , then turns and stomps away to where his ($_shinsou) harness is lying in a pile on the ground . He ($_shinsou) hadn t bothered to shift back ; once there had only been one dragon in the clearing , there had been a bit more space to breathe . 
Shouto ($_shouto) rolls his ($_shouto) eyes , returning to his ($_shouto) book . # . ) |(
They spend another hour or so on the ground before Bakugou ($_bakugou) begins to stir . The second his ($_shouto) eyes open enough for him ($_shouto) to look at the sky , he ($_shouto) scrambles to his ($_shouto) feet and immediately shifts . 
Why the fuck didn t someone wake me ? he ($_shouto) roars , pawing through the pile of gear for the makeshift saddle . 
Todoroki was still looking for his ($_shouto) pocketknife , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . He ($_shouto) d woken up a while ago and immediately begun to scribble away in a notebook . 
Did the fucker even find it ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) yells . 
Shouto ($_shouto) pulls it out of his ($_shouto) pocket and waves it . Shinsou ($_shinsou) does a double take , mouth half open in an unasked question . 
Understandable. He ($_shouto) d been under the impression that Shouto ($_shouto) had given up on it . 
Kacchan , give us five minutes and we ll take off , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , tucking his ($_midoriya) notebook in a bag before shifting . He ($_midoriya) slides into his ($_midoriya) harness , bags weighing heavy on both sides . Shinsou ($_shinsou) s already adjusting the straps on his ($_midoriya) own harness . 
There s thin trails of smoke rising from Bakugou ($_bakugou) s sneer . It s a good sign , Shouto ($_shouto) thinks . 
The saddle is soon found and put on . Bakugou ($_bakugou) sweeps him ($_midoriya) up on his ($_midoriya) tail instead of just tossing him ($_midoriya) up and hoping , something_Shouto ($_shouto) s bruised back thanks him ($_midoriya) for . 
The second they take off , Shouto ($_shouto) knows that the rest wasn t enough . Judging by the straining muscles , Bakugou ($_bakugou) isn t going to be able to fly for long before they ll have to stop again , for longer . Shouto ($_shouto) can t do anything at this point , though , so he ($_shouto) just flattens himself ($_shouto) against Bakugou ($_bakugou) and hopes for the best . 
The next few hours are hardly relaxing . Shouto ($_shouto) can feel every dip and wobble when a particularly strong gust of wind hits , threatening to send them careening through the sky . Bakugou ($_bakugou) grits his ($_bakugou) teeth and pushes through each one , tucking his ($_bakugou) limbs towards his ($_bakugou) body and flattening his ($_bakugou) spikes to reduce drag as much as he ($_bakugou) can . 
When they finally land , sun long set , Bakugou ($_bakugou) doesn t even wait for him ($_bakugou) to get off before collapsing . His ($_bakugou) sides are heaving , tail lying limp behind him ($_bakugou) , wings sprawled out on either side . Shouto ($_shouto) swings his ($_bakugou) legs over the row of spikes , then slides down a leg . 
His ($_bakugou) landing is perhaps ... not the most graceful . 
He ($_bakugou) stands up , brushing dirt off the seat of his ($_bakugou) pants . Behind him ($_bakugou) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) huffs out an attempt at a laugh . Shouto ($_shouto) shoots him ($_bakugou) a dirty look , but he ($_bakugou) just rolls his ($_bakugou) eyes . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) , you ($_bakugou) need to stretch , Shinsou ($_shinsou) says , wriggling out of his ($_shinsou) harness . 
In response , Bakugou ($_bakugou) opens his ($_bakugou) mouth and lets out a puff of smoke . 
When it clears , Shinsou ($_shinsou) is still standing there , extremely unimpressed . He ($_shinsou) s sitting on his ($_shinsou) haunches , tail wrapped primly around his ($_shinsou) feet , with his ($_shinsou) wings half open . 
Stretch or you ($_bakugou) won t be able to fly tomorrow . 
Fuck off! 
He ($_shinsou) shouldn t have said anything . Shinsou ($_shinsou) tilts his ($_shinsou) head , a smirk spreading over his ($_shinsou) features . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) hauls himself ($_bakugou) up and begins to go through a series of stretches , glaring at Shinsou ($_shinsou) all the while . Shinsou ($_shinsou) just sits there , controlling Bakugou ($_bakugou) with a slight sneer twisting his ($_bakugou) scales . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) is crouched next to Shouto , an idle claw tapping at the dirt . 
Did you ($_bakugou) tell him ($_bakugou) to do this ? Shouto ($_shouto) asks . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) chuckles , shaking his ($_midoriya) head . No , this is all Hitoshi . 
You ($_bakugou) re joking . 
If Bakugou ($_bakugou) can t fly , Hitoshi will probably be the one who has to carry him ($_bakugou) , Midoriya ($_midoriya) explains . That , and he ($_bakugou) s not a bad person at heart . Just a bit prickly . 
You ($_bakugou) don t say , Shouto ($_shouto) says , watching as Bakugou ($_bakugou) is forced into a particularly contorted stretch . # . ) |(
The next morning , Shouto ($_shouto) wakes up already in the air . 
He ($_shouto) rubs the sleep out of his ($_shouto) eyes , squinting in the pre-dawn light . It s silent , empty , the only sound the rush of the wind and the beats of the wings . The sky stretches out above him ($_shouto) , faint pinprick stars gleaming high overhead , not yet erased by the feathering rays of the sun gradually turning the black to lavenders and pinks . 
A puff of smoke rises in front of him ($_shouto) , obscuring the pinpricks among the pink . Shouto ($_shouto) squeezes his ($_shouto) eyes closed against the sting . When the smoke has cleared , the stars are almost imperceptible in the fast-growing light of the sun . 
Shouto ($_shouto) looks down now , to the earth far below . Yesterday , he ($_shouto) d been hesitant , first avoiding the sight of the closest thing he ($_shouto) d known to home dwindling away , then more worried about Bakugou ($_bakugou) s flagging strength than the blurred forests below . 
They d left the forests behind while he ($_shouto) was still sleeping , now gliding over a vast plain . A thin silver line cuts through the earth , some river winding its way through . Behind him ($_shouto) , in the mists , he ($_shouto) can see a glimpse of what might be the forests . In front , there s nothing until the lavender sky meets the yellowed plain in a haze of gray mist . 
Lost in the hollow sky , far above the endless plain , Shouto ($_shouto) is suddenly struck by just how small he ($_shouto) is . 
For years , he ($_shouto) d been a large presence in a small space , his ($_shouto) presence the purpose of that space . 
Now , no more than a speck high up in the sky , no bigger than the fast-fading pinpricks above to one on the ground , he ($_shouto) is tiny , insignificant . 
Shouto ($_shouto) is not quite sure what to feel . # . ) |(
The next few days pass in much the same fashion , Shouto waking up already on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s back among the stars , then spending the_whole_day ($_the) in the sky . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) hasn t yet had as hard a time in the air as the first day , remaining steady through the long flights . Shouto doesn t know what s changed , but he s quite glad that he doesn t have to pretend to lose another pocketknife . 
When they land the_third_day ($_the) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) takes one look at him and bursts out laughing . 
Turns out , the sun is much more intense higher up , and as a result Shouto s skin has turned a fiery red . 
While Bakugou ($_bakugou) is busy laughing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) bites back a grin and digs around in his ($_bakugou) bag for a few minutes before pulling out a small pot of green gel that will supposedly soothe and block the sun s rays . 
Aside from that , nothing particularly exciting happens until the_fifth_day ($_the) . 
Shouto ($_shouto) is not entirely sure how late it ($_shouto) is in the day . The endless plains below are covered in clouds , as is the sun ticking across the sky . 
This morning , they were just wisps of white , but as the pinprick stars faded , the clouds thickened , until they blocked out the lavender sky and the yellow plains and the silver river . 
And then , when Shouto ($_shouto) was lost in a haze of white , they darkened . 
Shouto ($_shouto) may not be sure of how late it ($_shouto) is , but he ($_shouto) does know that if they do not land soon , the quickening wind will soon send them down anyway . # . ) |(
Flying on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s back is very different . 
For one , his ($_shouto) scales are much smoother than Bakugou ($_bakugou) s . They slide together easily , more like the scales of a fish than plates of armor . 
For another , there are no spikes . 
When Shouto ($_shouto) rode on Bakugou ($_bakugou) , he ($_shouto) was crosslegged for most of the time , hemmed in by the tight rows of short spikes erupting in a shallow V down his ($_shouto) spine until they melded into a wide arrowhead at the tip of his ($_shouto) tail . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) , however , has nothing but a trail of something halfway between fur and feathers tracing out his spine . 
It s very soft . And plush. And comfortable. And throughout the following days Shouto ($_shouto) has to fight very very hard to not bury his face in it and fall asleep . 
The biggest difference , however , is that Midoriya ($_midoriya) s wing has not been bent backwards by the force of stormwinds . 
Behind him , Bakugou ($_bakugou) is sitting on Shinsou ($_shinsou) s back with an arm in a sling and a scowl on his face . 
Once the wind had begun to pick up , Bakugou ($_bakugou) had quickly begun to tire . Shouto ($_shouto) had not quite realized how bad it was until a crack of thunder broke open the clouds to let rain pour freely . 
Then , all had been chaos -- the churning wind , the booms and cracks of explosions and thunder indistinguishable , flashes of lighting or magic or something going off again and again , Shouto ($_shouto) clinging tight to Bakugou ($_bakugou) being tossed about like a feather until a particularly hard gust of wind hit and something twisted and Bakugou ($_bakugou) howled and then Shouto ($_shouto) was spinning through the grey-black clouds , unsure of up or down or wet or dry and then -- 
A flash of green , a web of almost-lightning tracing out a winged shape , and one hell of an impact barely softened by a trail of feather-fur . 
Draped over Midoriya ($_midoriya) s back , he ($_midoriya) d almost puked . Whether from the dizzy fall or the painful catch , he ($_midoriya) s still not quite sure . 
But now , the sky is clear above him ($_midoriya) and the plains are thriving below him ($_midoriya) and there is not a cloud to be seen . 
Shouto ($_shouto) closes his ($_shouto) eyes . The sun is warm on his ($_shouto) skin , the wind is gentle , and the world is wrapped in a peaceful , tired quiet . # . ) |(
That night , Bakugou ($_bakugou) walks off into the dark to sulk , a cloud of fireflies attracted to his ($_bakugou) sparking palms trailing behind him ($_bakugou) . Midoriya ($_midoriya) ducks away too , a small satchel slung across his ($_midoriya) back and a notebook filled with pressed leaves clutched in his ($_midoriya) arms . 
Shouto ($_shouto) is left with Shinsou ($_shinsou) , both sitting before the fire in a heavy silence . Shinsou ($_shinsou) is curled up , wings folded in and tail tucked around himself ($_midoriya) , watching it ($_shinsou) slowly die down into embers . Shouto ($_shouto) is reading a book , squinting at it in the fading light . A now-empty pot hangs over the fire , and a few bones lie on the ground off to the side . 
Shouto ($_shouto) turns a page . 
When Shinsou ($_shinsou) finally speaks , the fire is all but extinguished and Shouto ($_shouto) is doing his ($_shinsou) best to make out the words by the light of the_moon ($_the) . 
What book is that ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) looks up , eyes just barely widening . 
Was Shinsou trying to make small talk ? 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) huffs , tucking his ($_shinsou) head back into his ($_shinsou) tight ball . ... Never m -- 
The_Moon ($_the) Over the Mountain . 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) s head perks up . By Nakajima Atsushi ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) nods . 
He was a dragon , you know , Shinsou ($_shinsou) says offhandedly . 
Pardon ? 
Most of your great writers and things were , he continues . When we left , human society sort of stagnated . 
Shouto ($_shouto) blinks . Left? 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) cocks his ($_shinsou) head . Don ($_don) t you ($_don) know your ($_don) own history ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) resists the urge to roll his ($_shouto) eyes . Of course Shinsou ($_shinsou) wasn t trying to make small talk , just showing off how superior dragons were -- 
Uh , sorry , Shinsou ($_shinsou) says quietly . 
Shouto ($_shouto) is having difficulty deciding if he ($_shouto) is dreaming or not . Excuse me ? 
I shouldn t have , um Shinsou ($_shinsou) breaks off , tapping the tip of his ($_shouto) tail against the ground and thinking . When he ($_shouto) speaks again , the words are careful , set in places . When we left , humans mostly forgot us . It would be more surprising if you did know your own history , and I was condescending , so I m sorry . 
Shouto ($_shouto) narrows his ($_shouto) eyes . It s not like Shinsou ($_shinsou) to be ... well , nice . Did Midoriya ($_midoriya) put you up to this ? 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) snorts . He ($_shinsou) told me I was a dick . Didn t tell me to do anything about it . 
Did he ($_shinsou) really ? 
Close enough to it . 
They fall into a long , light silence after that , broken only by the crickets around them and the whisper of pages . 
... So what was up with the pocketknife ?
