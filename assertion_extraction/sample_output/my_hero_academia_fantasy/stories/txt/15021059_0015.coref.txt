Chapter 15 : Thorns 
Ah , the sun is out ! Finally! Kirishima ($_kirishima) said the moment he ($_kirishima) woke up . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) mumbled something , still sleeping , and shoved lazily at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
I can try going hunting so we can have something fresh to eat ! How s that sound ? 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) s answer was another grumble followed by , All the powder is wet . 
Damn! Forgot about that . 
Go gather more wood , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . It s getting cold . 
Right , Kirishima ($_kirishima) fished out the small hatchet from the sack . I ll see if there s anything small I can cut . 
Good. Go. 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) tried to stand up when Kirishima ($_kirishima) left the hut . He ($_bakugo) wobbled but was able to stand . However , he ($_bakugo) can not put pressure on his ($_bakugo) ankle . The pain is not as severe as it was yesterday , which is a good sign . One more day here , staying off the foot , and he ($_bakugo) should be able to walk well enough to continue to Fort Endeavor . He ($_bakugo) sat back down to wrap the cloak around himself ($_bakugo) , trying to stay warm . Bakugo ($_bakugo) closed his ($_bakugo) eyes to focus his ($_bakugo) mind on something other than the cold . His ($_bakugo) thoughts immediately went to Deku . 
That damn omega has always been a problem ! 
Should he ($_bakugo) have stayed back and waited for the snow to melt after that storm ? Yes. Should he ($_bakugo) have traveled with just Kirishima alone ? No . Would Deku ($_deku) have found a way to escape and make it back home ? Most likely. 
Bakugo wouldn t admit it to anyone , but he ($_bakugo) regrets leaving Mount Fervor to travel to Fort Endeavor . He ($_bakugo) has connections at Fort Endeavor and could have continued to send messages back and forth . But he ($_bakugo) has always been an alpha of action , and he ($_bakugo) hated sitting around waiting for something to happen . If it hadn t been snowy or the winter , he ($_bakugo) d be at Fort Endeavor by now . Both he ($_bakugo) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) screwed up with reading the map , though he ($_bakugo) won t let the gamma know that . 
I m going to strangle Deku ($_deku) when I see him ($_deku) ! It 's all his ($_deku) fault ! Bakugo grit his ($_deku) teeth annoyed that he ($_deku) can t convince himself ($_deku) he ($_deku) s made a mistake . He ($_deku) should have prepared for an ambush for the sake of it . With the snow , he ($_deku) didn t think the enemy would engage in such an attack . He ($_deku) doesn t doubt that they have a rat in the group . The rat might have suggested an ambush if they knew that he ($_deku) didn t expect a surprise attack . It s all Deku s fault ! Ever since I married him ($_deku) , shit s been hitting the windmill ! 
But he ($_deku) knew that isn t true . It s just easier on his ($_deku) conscience to blame someone else for his ($_deku) mistakes . 
Who needs an omega anyway? 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) crossed his ($_bakugo) arms over his ($_bakugo) chest and tried to think about anything but Deku ($_deku) . It didn t work . All he ($_deku) can see behind his ($_deku) eyelids is Deku ($_deku) s toned naked body on their bed . The cheeks are flushed darkly , the red making those freckles look like ripe strawberries . The sweet , sweet smell of lavender , so calming and tame . Those messy curls , sticking to Deku s forehead with sweat as he ($_deku) s mounted , arching his ($_deku) back and crying out Bakugo ($_bakugo) s name . Bakugo ($_bakugo) can smell the lavender as if it ($_bakugo) is right under his ($_deku) nose . 
Deku ($_deku) ? He ($_deku) opens his ($_deku) eyes , expecting to see the omega instead of finding Kirishima ($_kirishima) s wind-kissed face looking back at him ($_deku) . GEEZ! What the hell ? 
I m sorry , Bakugo ($_bakugo) ! I didn t mean to wake you up , but you were making strange noises and sweating . Do you have a fever ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) took off his ($_kirishima) glove to press it against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s forehead . 
It s not a fever ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) snapped at him ($_kirishima) . Mind your own damn business ! Get that fire started before I freeze my balls off ! 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) started to fill the stove and said , You d better hang on to your balls , then . If your cock gets any harder , those balls will shrivel up and fall off ! 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) turned his ($_bakugo) gaze to his ($_bakugo) crotch , seeing the visible tent in his ($_bakugo) pants , and he ($_bakugo) had to bite the inside of his ($_bakugo) cheek to keep from flipping out on Kirishima ($_kirishima) . All I have to do is think of you , and it ll go down ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) ignored Bakugo ($_bakugo) s insult . So long as you don t have a fever , that s all that matters ! 
~*~
What do you mean we re not leaving tonight ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked from his ($_izuku) spot at the table in his ($_izuku) prison chambers . 
Shoto ($_shoto) had come in around noon , flanked by Sero ($_sero) and Kaminari ($_kaminari) , to tell them that the plan is off . 
My father has fallen ill and has chosen to remain in bed today , Todoroki ($_todoroki) explained . With him ($_izuku) in the castle , it ($_todoroki) will be a greater risk of getting caught . We will try for tomorrow . 
Izuku ($_izuku) looked at Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , then back to Shoto . But , we were prepared to leave tonight ! Isn t there something you can do ? 
I m afraid not , Todoroki answered , straight-faced . Perhaps this delay will work out of the best . It allows time to get the snow horses ready , so you will not have to take the sled dogs . The snow horses are bred for this type of weather . 
I see . Thank you , Shoto ($_shoto) , Izuku said , looking down at the floor . 
I will have a hot bath sent up to you along with dinner , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . I am also supposed to have one the guards escort Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) to see Shoji ($_shoji) . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) shook his ($_tokoyami) head . I ($_tokoyami) prefer to remain here , 
Then I ($_tokoyami) will have Shoji ($_shoji) come here instead , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . He ($_shoji) has done his ($_shoji) job well thus far , and all he ($_shoji) asks is to see you . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , just see him ($_shoji) , Izuku ($_izuku) said , looking over at his ($_shoji) friend . Either he ($_shoji) can come here , or you can go to him ($_shoji) . 
I d rather him ($_shoji) come here , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) said with a sigh . He ($_tokoyami) did not want to leave Izuku ($_izuku) s side with Todoroki ($_todoroki) coming in and out . 
Izuku ($_izuku) turned back to Shoto . Bring Shoji ($_shoji) here when my ($_tokoyami) bath comes , he ($_shoji) said . I ($_tokoyami) ll take it in the water closet . I ($_tokoyami) don t care if it s a small space ; bring me ($_tokoyami) a smaller tub , then . He ($_shoji) turned back to Tokoyami . This way , you and Shoji ($_shoji) can have privacy , and it 's an order , Fumikage_Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) bowed his ($_tokoyami) head quickly . As you wish . 
Very well. Sero ($_sero) , go and see to it that the bath is ready and Shoji_'s ($_shoji) brought here , 
Right! Said_Sero ($_sero) . 
Kaminari ($_kaminari) , remain outside the room until Sero ($_sero) returns , 
You got it ! 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) bowed to Izuku . Please enjoy your bath and let the guards know if you need anything else . Good day to you . 
After Todoroki ($_todoroki) left , the alpha returned to his ($_todoroki) chambers to once again read the message addressed to Shoji , but Dabi ($_dabi) intercepted it . Shoji ($_shoji) doesn t know that this message ever came , and Todoroki ($_todoroki) is planning to keep it that way , for now . He thought back to when Dabi ($_dabi) brought him the letter . 
Why are you here ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) asked when Dabi ($_dabi) waltzed in , looking like the cat that swallowed the canary . He ($_dabi) didn t care at all for the mercenary leader , and his ($_dabi) father didn t either . Dabi ($_dabi) , however , is good at his ($_dabi) job , so his ($_dabi) behavior is overlooked . 
I have something that might interest you , Dabi ($_dabi) said with a lazy grin , holding up a small piece of paper . I just happened to be in the stables when this raven came by . Naturally , I took the message , saw who it was for , and read it . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) narrowed his eyes . Was it ($_todoroki) addressed to me ? If so , that ($_todoroki) is a crime punishable by death , Commander Dabi ($_dabi) . 
Dabi ($_dabi) snickered . It ($_todoroki) was addressed to that big guy , Shoji ($_shoji) . I know something you don t know , He said in a mocking , teasing tone . 
Enough , Dabi ($_dabi) ! Todoroki ($_todoroki) stood up from his reading chair . What does that letter contain ? Give it to me , now ! That s an order ! 
Dabi ($_dabi) wagged the paper tauntingly in Todoroki ($_todoroki) s direction . Do you honestly think I d give you this juicy information out of the goodness of my heart ? 
I ll raise your wage , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said , knowing that is what the greedy bastard wanted . Now give me the paper . Do not look at me like that . I am true to my word . 
Dabi ($_dabi) handed him the paper , which Todoroki ($_todoroki) snatched from him . 
You re dismissed , Commander Dabi ($_dabi) . 
Don t forget your promise , 
I won t. 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) read the note again and again . The contents of the message are the real reason why he decided not to let Izuku ($_izuku) and the others go . It is signed by Iida who stays that Bakugo ($_bakugo) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) have left by sled dogs to come to Fort Endeavor , and to watch for them . The message gave him a better idea , which is to keep Izuku ($_izuku) here and let Bakugo ($_bakugo) come to him . He would much rather have the unpredictable alpha under lock and key in this place rather than in the_Northern_Territory ($_the) . Todoroki ($_todoroki) can watch over Bakugo ($_bakugo) here . Bakugo ($_bakugo) will have to go in a dungeon because he ($_bakugo) can not be trusted anywhere else . For Izuku ($_izuku) , he ($_bakugo) would make sure the dungeon is comfortable enough for Bakugo ($_bakugo) to live in , as the alpha will be there for a while . Fort_Endeavor ($_endeavor) did have one or two cells that are meant for nobles . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) s plan to come here and rescue Izuku would have worked had it not been for Dabi ($_dabi) finding the message . Todoroki ($_todoroki) did not think that Bakugo ($_bakugo) would risk such a perilous journey in the winter weather right after a snowstorm for the sake of an omega . He ($_bakugo) would do it for an omega , but Bakugo ($_bakugo) ? It didn t make any sense other than the alpha must genuinely care for Izuku ($_izuku) . 
No . Todoroki ($_todoroki) can t believe someone like Bakugo ($_bakugo) would care about another person like this . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s angry because his ($_bakugo) favorite toy has in charge of away and he ($_bakugo) has had a blow to his ($_bakugo) pride . 
It was an excellent plan , he ($_bakugo) thought . Todoroki ($_todoroki) had it all figured out . Shoji ($_shoji) has no real loyalty to him ($_bakugo) , but the large gamma is faithful to Tokoyami , who is loyal to Izuku , which makes them both loyal to Bakugo . Shoji ($_shoji) would probably have snuck them in , got horses ready , and they all would leave in the dark of night . The rest of the plan they would play by ear . 
Close , Bakugo ($_bakugo) , but not close enough . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) has no plans to use Bakugo_against_Izuku ($_bakugo) Izuku ($_izuku) to make the omega desire him ($_bakugo) . He ($_bakugo) already knows Izuku ($_izuku) s true feelings , and they are meant for Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Having Izuku ($_izuku) here is only a bonus to having Bakugo ($_bakugo) as a prisoner . It will leave Mount Fervor open and defenseless . Todoroki ($_todoroki) planned to send his own messages to Bakugo s allies asking for them to side with him instead . If the allies know Bakugo ($_bakugo) is locked up in a dungeon , most will flock to join the_Western_Territory ($_the) simply out of spite . Katsuki_Bakugo ($_bakugo) is not favored among the nobles , though he ($_bakugo) is feared . What has saved Bakugo ($_bakugo) all these years is how much the Northern King favors him ($_bakugo) , thus excusing Bakugo_'s ($_bakugo) brutality . Todoroki ($_todoroki) will conduct himself ($_bakugo) in an entirely different manner than Bakugo ($_bakugo) , acting with composure , poise , leadership , and understanding . At the very least , he ($_bakugo) will be able to stop the Northern Territory attacks on the_Western ($_the) . And it ($_the) is no lie that his ($_bakugo) father is sick . Enji_Todoroki ($_todoroki) is very ill , but no one is supposed to know . The physician told him ($_bakugo) that he ($_bakugo) should be prepared to take his ($_bakugo) father s place at Fort_Endeavor ($_endeavor) should the worse happen . But that was something to think about later . 
I acted without haste and waited patiently to make my move , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said to himself ($_todoroki) as he ($_todoroki) went over to his ($_todoroki) chessboard , setting up four pieces in the center . Two kings , one knight , and one rook . The_black_king ($_bakugo) is his ($_bakugo) father , and the_white_king ($_bakugo) is Bakugo ($_bakugo) . The rook is himself ($_bakugo) , and the knight is Izuku ($_izuku) . Everything is falling into place , and I haven t had to lift a finger , First , he ($_bakugo) took away the white king followed by the_black_king ($_bakugo) , placing them to the side . He ($_bakugo) then moved the knight to stand beside the rook . Hearts can change in time , he ($_bakugo) took the knight from the board and held it in his ($_bakugo) hand . I will accept some of Izuku ($_izuku) if I can t have all of him ($_bakugo) . 
~*~
Izuku ($_izuku) stared at the silhouetted couple through the privacy curtain from the bathtub . Having the privacy curtain was better than being in the water closet . He ($_bakugo) can hear what they are saying even though they are speaking low . As he ($_bakugo) listened , he ($_bakugo) grew jealous of them . 
Nothing was by your choice , which makes you blameless , Shoji ($_shoji) said . 
It still happened , though , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) said . I liked that I ve only known your body all this time , but now - 
That hasn t changed , Shoji ($_shoji) said , interrupting him ($_shoji) . I ve said it before , and I ll repeat it forever if I have to ; I don t judge or dislike you because of what happened . If anything , I want to be with you more , to help protect you . I don t think less of you . The fact that you can carry on and still hold your head up high is a strength that not many possess . The promises we made to each other that night in the hayloft have not changed . 
It was a wonderful night until we got caught . 
I don t care about that . It s in the past , and now there s only us . We don t have to fear anyone anymore . 
Not in that same way , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) had to point out . 
Yes , of course . But you can make your own choices , and there are many gammas , alphas , and betas that would like to have you as their own . I consider myself the luckiest of them all . I don t respect you any less because of what happened , and I ll do whatever I can to assure you of that . 
Shut up , Shoji ($_shoji) Shoji_,_Izuku ($_shoji) said in his ($_shoji) head . Izuku ($_izuku) immediately regretting thinking such a thing . He ($_shoji) wants Kacchan to feel that way about him ($_shoji) . It was a moment of envy . I m sorry , Shoji ($_shoji) . He ($_shoji) heard Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) whisper something to Shoji , but he ($_shoji) couldn t make it out . 
Izuku ($_izuku) , are you finished yet ? Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) aked . 
Almost , Izuku ($_izuku) answered . 
Alright then. Let me use the water closet first , 
Izuku ($_izuku) watched the shadowed pair exchange a kiss and an embrace . He ($_izuku) s always seen Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) as a strong fighter , which he ($_izuku) is , but the gamma commander looks like a child in Shoji ($_shoji) s giant arms . Izuku ($_izuku) was an inch or two taller than Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , not that it mattered in any way . 
When he ($_izuku) heard Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) go into the water closet and Shoji ($_shoji) is ready to leave , Izuku ($_izuku) called the tall gamma over . Shoji ($_shoji) ? 
Yes , Dom-Omega ? 
Thank you . For everything . 
Shoji ($_shoji) was silent for a second , then responded with , You re welcome . 
Izuku ($_izuku) heard Shoji ($_shoji) leave and then Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) peeked around the privacy curtain a few minutes later . Is everything alright ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) smiled sadly at him ($_izuku) . Yeah , I m fine . Just thanking Shoji ($_shoji) for being so understanding , and admiring how lucky you are to have him ($_shoji) . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) bowed his ($_tokoyami) head . I ($_tokoyami) would trade my ($_tokoyami) happiness for yours , 
Don t be like that , Izuku ($_izuku) said . I ($_tokoyami) was thinking about something earlier , and I ($_tokoyami) would like your opinion . It s about marriage . 
I m listening . 
If marriage is only viewed as a business arrangement , then why should a married pair be forced to remain with each other and not ... wander . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) raised a dark brow . I m not sure what you mean . 
As an omega , I m not allowed to stray from my marriage to Kacchan , but Kacchan ($_kacchan) is allowed to be with whomever he ($_kacchan) wants . It s not fair . I should have the same option . What I m saying is , why are there limits in a marriage that is for business purposes only ? Stay married in name only for necessary purposes , then live your own life . It would seem easier to accept the marriage as a business partnership but not be limited to what one can do . If it is a marriage out of love , then that s a different story . 
You re not suggesting taking Todoroki ($_todoroki) s offer of marriage , are you ? 
No ! Izuku ($_izuku) said quickly . No , not at all . I know I love Kacchan ($_kacchan) , and in his ($_kacchan) , way , he ($_kacchan) loves me too . I haven t really spoken to Kacchan ($_kacchan) about this since the last time we mated when I wasn t in heat . Kacchan ($_kacchan) expressed his ($_kacchan) feelings as best he ($_kacchan) could , and I accepted them . Even when I leave Fort Endeavor and return home to Mount Fervor , nothing is going to change . Kacchan ($_kacchan) will still be the same as he ($_kacchan) always is . My marriage with Kacchan ($_kacchan) , I fear , will always be a struggle of wills . When I have children with him ($_kacchan) , I ll be limited to what I can do because I must put my children first before anything else . I don t think Kacchan ($_kacchan) will feel the same way about the children as I will . Our relationship is always going to be a struggle , but how long can you love someone like that ? What if , later in the years , I think I made a mistake staying with Kacchan ($_kacchan) ? By then it will be too late . I need to incorporate love with struggle and limitations , rather than be happy . He slapped his hands to his face . I ve been rambling all this time ! I m sorry , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) . I want what you have with Shoji ($_shoji) . I do n't think I 'm even making any sense anymore ! '' 
Do not be sorry , he said . And you must not forget that both Shoji ($_shoji) and I are gammas . We do not have the biological makeup of alphas and omegas . Our bodies and hearts are not connected on a bonding level such as yours . You ve said so yourself that you have always liked Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Yes , your marriage is complicated , and everyone knows that Bakugo ($_bakugo) is more than a little overbearing and difficult to handle . But if you grab and pick a rose , you will be stuck with its thorns . You will bleed , but soon the bleeding will stop . The rose you hold in your hand is still beautiful , and you keep it because you like it . You can strip the stem of the thorns , but they will grow back , and you will bleed again . But in the end , the rose is still there . It will look the same and smell the same . Life is not a fairytale story , Izuku ($_izuku) . Look at your struggles and limitation in your marriage as a way to grow stronger . Time has a great way of changing things , just like time will help us heal . 
Izuku ($_izuku) smiled at him . I get what you are saying , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) . Though Kacchan ($_kacchan) is far from a rose . 
An iron rose , maybe . 
But do you understand what I am saying ? About arranged marriages ? 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) nodded . I do . But as you ve argued many times , we need to change society before we can see any development . 
And Shoto ($_shoto) can give me that , Izuku ($_izuku) said softly . I ll cause a war between the territories . I would be lying to Shoto if I marry him , and Kacchan ($_kacchan) will forever hate me . He lifted both hands from the water , palms up . I can achieve happiness in the long run by marrying Shoto ($_shoto) and changing the world , he lifted one hand higher than the other , like a scale . But my heart does not belong to Shoto it belongs to Kacchan , he switched the height of hands . My omega heart yearns for Kacchan ($_kacchan) , but my will and mind yearns for the opportunities Shoto ($_shoto) can deliver . Do I follow my ideas for change or my heart ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) , you ($_izuku) are in a challenging and complicated situation , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) said . I blame all of this on Bakugo ($_bakugo) and forgive me for saying that . But he has not bonded with you ($_izuku) , and this is why you ($_izuku) have such conflicting thoughts of your ($_izuku) feelings . If Bakugo ($_bakugo) bonded you ($_izuku) to him , then you ($_izuku) can achieve the goals you ($_izuku) want while also having the alpha you ($_izuku) want . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) was silent for a moment , then said , Permission to speak plainly about the alphas ? 
You ($_izuku) know I hate when you ($_izuku) keep things from me . And granted. 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) s ordinarily stoic features became hard and dark . They are both ambitious alphas who will stop at nothing to see their goals achieved , with or without you ($_izuku) . Neither one of them deserves you ($_izuku) . In the end , they will do what is best for them , not for you ($_izuku) . 
Izuku ($_izuku) nodded , and it hurt to know that Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) is probably right . What if I were to raise an army against them ? Just for the sake of argument . 
Then I will follow you ($_izuku) , along with the Ravens , and we will win , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) stated clearly . 
But no one will listen to an omega or see them as a leader . War is going to happen between the West and the North , 
And it wouldn t matter which alpha s side you ($_izuku) are on . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) pointed out . Remember , you ($_izuku) married Bakugo ($_bakugo) to save your ($_izuku) family , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s army needs your ($_izuku) lands . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s gotten what he ($_bakugo) wants from you ($_izuku) . Todoroki ($_todoroki) wants you ($_izuku) for a mate to ignite Bakugo ($_bakugo) s rage . In my honest opinion , I think you ($_izuku) should forget about your ($_izuku) family home . For now. You ($_izuku) can restore the good name of Midoriya and the pride of Almight_Castle ($_castle) through other means at a later time . It s one of the issues holding you ($_izuku) back , and it does n't have to be . 
Desert Almight Castle ? 
Yes. After all that has happened , I have changed my thoughts about saving Almight_Castle ($_castle) . Let Bakugo ($_bakugo) worry about it ($_castle) . Win it ($_castle) back later . Let s get home to Mount Fervor , you ($_izuku) need to bond with Bakugo ($_bakugo) , and then we will go from there . 
Izuku ($_izuku) looked down at the cooling water . The old texts say that omegas had the power to control alphas . Kacchan ($_kacchan) is my challenge , and he ($_kacchan) is the one I want . 
If you ($_izuku) want something , go after it , He ($_kacchan) added , the cruelest way would be to accept Todoroki ($_todoroki) s proposal , use him ($_kacchan) to help you ($_izuku) get what you ($_izuku) want , then leave him ($_kacchan) for Bakugo ($_bakugo) . 
Izuku ($_izuku) gasped softly . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , how can you ($_izuku) even think up such a thing ? 
Am I wrong ? 
You ($_izuku) re not . But , I could never do that . Not to Shoto , and not to anyone . 
I know you ($_izuku) wouldn t. I couldn t do that either . 
I shouldn t have either of them , Izuku ($_izuku) said with a laugh . I want my own kingdom where I am the lord . I want an army , he ($_kacchan) looked over at his ($_kacchan) family sword standing in the corner of the room . I know I can lead everyone to victory ! If only I could he ($_kacchan) needs an alpha to achieve this , but Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) is right . Both Kacchan and Shoto ($_shoto) are ambitious . 
Are you ($_izuku) ready to get out now , Izuku ($_izuku) ? 
Yes. I m getting wrinkly , but I have a lot of thinking to do . I know it s late , but can you ($_izuku) get the writing desk ready for me ? I ll be up all night , I m certain of it . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) bowed his ($_tokoyami) head . Yes , I will see it done . 
~*~
We re almost there ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) said with a holler of victory as they finally crossed the border into the_Western_Territory ($_the) . 
About goddamn time ! I grew a beard making it here ! said Bakugo ($_bakugo) . 
Fortune had smiled upon them when a band of outlaws riding snow horses came passing by the toll hut . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped them , asked for a horse , but they refused . Kirishima ($_kirishima) made short work of them after they attacked . He ($_kirishima) didn t kill any of them , but he ($_kirishima) maimed the whole party , and the leader gave him ($_kirishima) a snow horse . With the snow horse , they were able to leave the heaviest of their supplies behind because they can reach the border at a much faster pace . 
Lucky for them , it hadn t snowed as much in the_Western_Territory ($_the) as it did in the North . 
I think we made good time despite your mishap , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said . 
I can walk on it now , so we say nothing more of it . 
They made camp for the night then continued to Fort Endeavor . By the afternoon , they saw the stronghold . They waited until nightfall , let the snow horse go , and approached the fort on foot . 
There 's no moon tonight , Kirishima ($_kirishima) whispered . That s good news for us ! 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) agreed with him . The night sky above is pitch black . I think I see the stables , he whispered . Don t lumber around ! Step lightly . 
They snuck to the stables , staying out of the radius of torchlights , and looking for signs of Shoji ($_shoji) . 
It s odd that there aren t more people in the stables , Bakugo ($_bakugo) whispered to Kirishima . 
Why is that? 
You idiot . There 's torches lit , which means people should be around . Otherwise , they wouldn t waste the oil or the wood . Where is everyone ? 
Maybe they re having dinner ? 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) rolled his ($_bakugo) eyes . Or something 's up . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s eyes widened . You think it s a trick of some kind ? But , no one knows we re coming ! 
Some do , Bakugo ($_bakugo) reminded him . The fucking rat . If the rat is close enough in our circle , which I think they are , they probably sent word to the Todorokis . Maybe they re expecting us . 
So , what do we do ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked . 
We sit and wait a little bit longer , He said . We ll wait them out . Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked up at the rest of Fort Endeavor , knowing that somewhere behind those walls is Deku . Stupid omega . Be fucking thankful I m doing any of this for you ! 
They continued to wait throughout the night , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) slipped off into sleep before Bakugo ($_bakugo) woke him up . 
Is it ($_kirishima) time to go ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked . 
No . I still haven t seen Shoji ($_shoji) . Though there are people on the move now . I ve seen one or two . Let s get closer . 
They left their hiding spot behind the shrubs to take cover behind hay bales . Bakugo ($_bakugo) can see inside the stables now . The horses and cattle are penned in their stalls . Come on , you big lumbering idiot ! Where the hell are you ? A few minutes later , as if Shoji ($_shoji) heard him , the large gamma appeared carrying a milk can . Fucking finally! 
There is he ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) pointed out . Let s go ! 
No , we ll call him over , Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked around on the ground to pick up some rocks and throw them towards Shoji ($_shoji) . After the third stone , Shoji ($_shoji) started walking in there direction . Bakugo ($_bakugo) quickly made sure no one else was around before lifting his ($_bakugo) head from behind the bales . 
Shoji ($_shoji) s eyes widened . Lord_Bakugo ($_bakugo) ! he ($_bakugo) whispered . 
And me too ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) announced , also in a whisper . 
I knew you would come , Shoji ($_shoji) said . The stables are empty right now . I can hide you in the loft for now . 
Yeah , we re fucking freezing out here ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . Took you long enough ! 
I apologize . I was busy with one of the horses . She gave birth to a healthy colt ! 
Right now I could care less about a horse , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said , following behind Shoji ($_shoji) into the warmth of the stables . 
How are Izuku and Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked . 
So far so good , Shoji ($_shoji) said , leading them to the ladder for the loft . Stay quiet and stay low . I ll get you something to eat . 
The doors to the stables suddenly slammed shut . It startled the animals as well as the three . The doors leading into the fort closed as well . The three looked all around , knowing that they are trapped . Bakugo ($_bakugo) hissed to himself ($_bakugo) . He ($_bakugo) knew something was up , yet he ($_bakugo) still walked right into the lion s den . He ($_bakugo) had put too much hope in Shoji ($_shoji) . His ($_bakugo) eyes narrowed as armed men came out from the stalls of the animals . They 're surrounded , and the three pressed their backs together . 
Welcome , Alpha Lord Bakugo ($_bakugo) , to Fort Endeavor . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) knew that voice . It wasn t Todoroki , but another he ($_bakugo) is familiar with . Sure enough , the gamma showed himself ($_bakugo) . Commander-Fucking-Dabi_,_Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . You look as ugly as ever . 
Same old Bakugo , Dabi ($_dabi) said with a sigh . But it is nice to speak to you again . 
Wish I could say the same , Bakugo ($_bakugo) snorted . Last time I spoke to you , your face was smooshed into a pile of cow shit . Still gnawing away at the old revenge bone of me kicking your sorry ass into oblivion ? 
Wait , Commander Dabi ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked at Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Isn t he the guy you pissed on after you won in some fight ? 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) smirked . While his ($_bakugo) mouth was full of cow shit ? Damn right I did . I ve got to say , the cow shit was prettier ! 
Dabi ($_dabi) only smiled . But you forget who holds the cards now . I got my revenge already . Well , some of it , He ($_dabi) smirked . Watching your unborn child leak from the thighs of your whore after he ($_dabi) was mounted over and over again was the base for a magnificent ballad . 
YOU BASTARD ! 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) lunged at Dabi ($_dabi) , pulling out his ($_bakugo) sword . The other soldiers jumped to defend Dabi ($_dabi) , pointing their spears at Bakugo ($_bakugo) to stop him ($_dabi) . Bakugo ($_bakugo) knocked the spears out of his ($_bakugo) way , as many as he ($_bakugo) could , but he ($_bakugo) was not properly prepared to fight such heavily armed men . Not after the long journey he ($_bakugo) took through the snow . He ($_bakugo) didn t give up , though . He ($_bakugo) can hear Kirishima struggling behind him ($_bakugo) . Bakugo ($_bakugo) then lets out a cry of pain as a spearhead found his ($_bakugo) leg , stabbing it . The action forced him ($_bakugo) to turn to the male wielding the spear , only to have something hit him ($_bakugo) in the head . His ($_bakugo) vision blurred , making him ($_bakugo) stumble . Another stab to his ($_bakugo) shoulder , then to his ($_bakugo) arm , and then another blow to the head . Bakugo ($_bakugo) fell to the straw-covered floor , writhing as he ($_bakugo) tried to stand . None of the wounds are deep enough to kill him ($_bakugo) . This was to immobilize him ($_bakugo) . He ($_bakugo) glanced up to see Dabi ($_dabi) s smiling face as the gamma pulled out his ($_bakugo) cock . Bakugo wouldn t let the bastard piss on him ($_bakugo) ! 
LOOK OUT ! Shouted one of the males as they saw Shoji ($_shoji) lift up a large wooden beam over his ($_shoji) head . 
Before Dabi ($_dabi) could piss on Bakugo ($_bakugo) , he ($_shoji) , along with the males beside him ($_shoji) , where knocked back by the massive piece of lumber , a post used for holding up the ceiling of the stable . The thick wood knocked the group to the floor , trapping them there . It only stopped them for a few moments , but it gave both Shoij and Kirishima ($_kirishima) the opportunity to strike back . Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked behind him ($_shoji) to see Shoji ($_shoji) lifting heavy sacks of what is probably animal feed , swinging the bags around and knocking the soldiers to the floor . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s sword has blood on the blade . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) started to get up , to join in the fight , but he ($_bakugo) was suddenly picked up by Shoji ($_shoji) and thrown over the large gamma s shoulder . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was already ahead of them , throwing his ($_bakugo) body into the stable doors to try and get it open . Shoji ($_shoji) shouted move and used his ($_shoji) greater strength to slam violently into the doors , twice , before they gave way . 
To the woods ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) shouted , only to be stopped when an arrow landed in front of him ($_shoji) . A rain of arrows came at them . Kirishima ($_kirishima) hissed as one struck his ($_kirishima) foot as well as his ($_kirishima) shoulder . 
Shoji ($_shoji) was able to shield Bakugo ($_bakugo) , but he ($_shoji) too took an arrow to the back . It wasn t enough to knock him ($_shoji) off his ($_shoji) feet , though his ($_shoji) stance did not last long . The three are surrounded again by double the number of soldiers . Shoji ($_shoji) knew it was time to surrender . There is no way they will escape without losing their lives in the process . 
You re under arrest for trespassing ! Said one of the head guards . You will be brought to the dungeons ! 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) managed to stand up and smirk evilly at the males surrounding them . Go ahead , put me in the dungeons ! I will tear this shithole apart stone by stone starting from the bowels up ! You will all rue the day you put me behind bars ! 
As they 're captured , Bakugo ($_bakugo) still fought tooth and nail , harming a handful of the soldiers . They ended up binding him ($_bakugo) in chains and shackles to transport him ($_bakugo) to the dungeons . They had to do the same to Kirishima . Shoji ($_shoji) did not put up a fight but went silently with the two . 
Bakugo_'s ($_bakugo) released from his ($_bakugo) binds and Dabi ($_dabi) shoves him ($_bakugo) into a cell , quickly slamming the door and locking it . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s body ached from the wounds and the struggle , though he ($_bakugo) would not let Dabi ($_dabi) see . They glared at each other through the small barred window of the door . 
You going to jack off to this tonight ? He ($_bakugo) taunted Dabi ($_dabi) . 
I jack off to your whore every night , Dabi ($_dabi) countered , enjoying the glare he ($_dabi) got from Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Do n't worry , I wouldn t touch your disgusting sloppy seconds in the first place , but imagining your bitch as my bitch is acceptable . 
I let you off easy last time with just my piss , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . I ve already planned your demise , he ($_bakugo) smirked at Dabi ($_dabi) . Maybe I ll let you choose your suffering . 
Dabi ($_dabi) chuckled . Do tell. 
You think I jest ? 
Oh , I know you don t jest . But I would still like to hear it . Before Bakugo ($_bakugo) could start , Dabi ($_dabi) added , Oh , does your whore know of the bowels of Mount Fervor ? You know , the torture chamber there ? 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) smirked . No . He ($_bakugo) doesn t. 
I ll be sure to tell him ($_bakugo) that his ($_bakugo) husband is a monster who tortures others . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) walked up to the door to face Dabi ($_dabi) . Unlike my grandfathers , I only torture those who deserve it , as I will torture you . And I don t do the torturing . I leave that to the expert . But I will conduct yours . 
So , tell me , what do you plan to do to me ? 
A few things . Nail your intestines to a tree and force you to walk around the trunk , watching as they slowly unravel . Flay you of all your skin and use it for dungeon decoration . Tie you up , cover you in meat , and feed you to my dogs . Maybe drawn and quartered , of course . Racking is child s play . As of now , I m leaning more towards intestines and the tree . 
Dabi ($_dabi) nodded , unphased by Bakugo ($_bakugo) s threats . Truly barbaric. Be grateful I m not a monster like you , or I would take those options and use them on your sweet freckled-face omega . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes widened , then narrowed dangerously at Dabi ($_dabi) as he ($_bakugo) threw himself ($_bakugo) at the door , snarling in outrage like a wild animal . He ($_bakugo) didn t care if it is putting a strain on his ($_bakugo) body and his ($_bakugo) wounds . 
Farewell for now . Dabi ($_dabi) said and left Bakugo screaming and clawing viciously at the dungeon door . 
~*~
Is it done ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) asked when Dabi ($_dabi) entered his ($_dabi) chambers the next morning . 
Yes. We caught both Bakugo ($_bakugo) and his ($_bakugo) red-headed gamma . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) nodded . You re dismissed . Do not mention anything to the Dom-Omega , or I will take back that raise , He ($_bakugo) warned . 
Dabi ($_dabi) smirked . Very well. I suppose you ll go and see Bakugo ($_bakugo) ? 
I will , but later . 
Ah , yes . Your old man may just croak any day now . Will you dance on his grave ? 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) slowly lifted his gaze to Dabi . Do watch your tongue , Commander Dabi ($_dabi) . For I may be in charge of Fort Endeavor very , very soon ; and you don t want me dismissing you of your duties here . 
Dabi ($_dabi) shrugged his ($_dabi) shoulders . I got my revenge on Bakugo ($_bakugo) . So far , that is . I have revenge elsewhere . 
I m not interested in your life , Commander Dabi , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . You had the physician see to their wounds ? 
Yes. 
The only one who will not remain in the dungeon is Shoji ($_shoji) . I will release him ($_shoji) myself . 
That one has the strength of a giant , Dabi ($_dabi) pointed out . 
I have my reasons for releasing him ($_shoji) . That will be all , Commander Dabi ($_dabi) . 
Dabi ($_dabi) bowed and left the room . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) finished up some paperwork before making his way to the dungeon . He passed through the dank , dark cells used to keep criminals , ignoring their cries and begs for mercy . Passing through another door leads into the nicer part of the dungeon , which has four large and furnished cells . He knows Bakugo ($_bakugo) is in the largest one . Todoroki ($_todoroki) goes to that door and knocks first , then opens the hatch to look through the bars . He can see inside the cell , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) is sitting on the bed . The crimson eyes saw him , and they glared darkly . 
You ($_kirishima) were foolish to come out this way by yourself ($_kirishima) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) Bakugo_,_Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . 
That attack was all planned , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . How the hell did you ($_kirishima) know ? 
I didn t. Commander_Dabi ($_commander) told me . He ($_commander) intercepted a raven s message meant for Shoji ($_shoji) . It was sent by Iida , warning Shoji ($_shoji) that you ($_kirishima) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) were coming , and that he ($_commander) is to watch for you_both ($_kirishima) and help you ($_kirishima) inside . Dabi ($_dabi) got to it before Shoji ($_shoji) , and he ($_commander) showed it to me . I couldn t just ignore it . You ($_kirishima) are my enemy , after all . 
Does Deku know I m here ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) asked . 
No , he ($_bakugo) doesn t. I will be the one to tell him ($_bakugo) . He ($_bakugo) hasn t been harmed in any way . 
I know you ($_kirishima) wouldn t harm him ($_bakugo) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . What are your ($_kirishima) plans now that you ($_kirishima) have me behind bars ? Are you ($_kirishima) going to make me a slave as I made you ($_kirishima) ? 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) shook his ($_todoroki) head . Unlike you ($_kirishima) , I have a sense of humanity . You ($_kirishima) will remain in this dungeon . I will have Kirishima ($_kirishima) moved in with you ($_kirishima) so you ($_kirishima) can have company . I don t need you ($_kirishima) going insane from loneliness . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) scoffed . So , you ($_kirishima) re friends with Dabi ($_dabi) then ? Doesn t seem like the type of company you ($_kirishima) keep . 
No . He is under my father s employment . I don t like him , and I will see him removed from my home as soon as it is possible . 
Looks like we finally agree on something , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . Though you ($_kirishima) have something else planned , don t you ($_kirishima) ? 
I do . 
Whatever it is , I ll foil it . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) said , We ll see about that . Don ($_don) t forget , you ($_don) are the one behind bars , and I am the one in control .
