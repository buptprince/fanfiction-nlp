It s late afternoon going into evening as they descend the far side of the mountains into a country of rolling , green hills . Izuku ($_izuku) looks all around for some sort of familiar landmark to point them in the direction of the capitol ruins . 
There. Izuku ($_izuku) points off to the distance and the two on either side of him ($_izuku) follow the direction of his ($_izuku) finger . The river , it runs past the_capitol ($_the) , there s a large curve where it almost doubles back on itself around a hill , that s where the_capitol ($_the) was . 
Banking in the direction Izuku was pointing , Kirishima ($_kirishima) sets them on a path to head down river . 
As the sun sinks lower toward the horizon a glint catches their eyes . 
Is that it ? 
Possibly. 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) knocks his ($_bakugou) fist on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hard scales to get his ($_bakugou) attention . We ll go until we reach where that reflection was . It 's either the_capitol ($_the) or a ruined building we can shelter in . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) lets out a grunt of agreement , making his ($_kirishima) way toward the point where the reflection had originated . 
*
The small group descends to the ruins on the hill below . Crumbling walls mark the outlines of the city , blackened by fires long since burned out . Houses reduced to their foundations , toppled and left to be overgrown . Where the hill reaches its peak , near the loop in the river , sits the crumbling remains of a once great castle . 
We re here . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifts as soon as the other have located a sheltered place to spend the night and unloaded their things . This place is a mess . How has no one noticed it just sitting here ? 
It 's magic , you dumbass . 
Magic ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) looks around with squinty eyes before scratching the back of his ($_kirishima) head . Huh , weird . 
How did I pick that up before you ? You re a fucking dragon Kirishima , this sort of thing should be second nature to you . 
Yeah , but , well , I m used to magic that s more in my face , this stuff s more subtle , like it 's trying to redirect rather than obscure . His ($_kirishima) gaze shifts over to Izuku as he ($_kirishima) builds up a pile of wood for a fire . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) is standing near the green haired young man , his eyes shifting nervously and his stance tense , much like Bakugou ($_bakugou) s. Izuku on the other hand is relaxed and doesn t seem to notice how off putting the whole area is , as if something is trying to tell them to leave , leave now . 
Maybe we shouldn t stay here tonight , you know . The longer I stand here the creepier this place is feeling . 
Izuku ($_izuku) looks up from gather firewood and looks at his ($_izuku) three companions . Hmm? I know these ruins aren t the best , but it 's not that bad ? 
Three pairs of eyes turn to face the smallest member of their party , surprise evident in their gazes . 
How do you not feel that itching wrongness , like we aren t welcome here ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) steps closer to the green haired young man , stopping after a few steps , then backing up before moving forward again . Huh ($_huh) ? 
What the fuck are you doing Half n Half ? 
Move closer to Izuku and tell me if it feels different . 
What the fuck . Bakugou ($_bakugou) takes several steps towards Izuku ($_izuku) , making the young man even more confused than before . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s brows creases and he ($_bakugou) does the same little dance as Todoroki ($_todoroki) did a moment before . What the actual fuck ? 
Curious Kirishima does the same thing and notices that the unwelcome atmosphere surrounding them lessens the closer to Izuku ($_izuku) they come . That s kinda weird . Hey Izuku , come over here , I wan na check something . 
Still confused , Izuku ($_izuku) walks over to Kirishima and the feeling of wrongness leaves the dragon . 
Huh ($_huh) ? You guys picked up on that too ? 
Of course we did you idiot . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) nods , a hand coming to rest under his chin . It ($_todoroki) 's odd . I wonder if it ($_todoroki) 's because he used to live here . 
What , what did you guys notice ? I m so lost right now . 
The other three look around at one another before Bakugou ($_bakugou) shrugs and steps up to be right next to Izuku . It 's like you nullify the bad feelings this place gives off . Don t worry about it , we can figure it out in the morning , let s just get set up and go to sleep . 
Same shifts as last_night ($_last) ? 
Shifts ? 
Fine , come on Izuku ($_izuku) , let s get set up , the sooner we sleep the sooner I can take watch . 
And the sooner you can let me sleep through my turn at watch . Izuku ($_izuku) lets out a long sigh , but goes about setting up the fire wood to keep them warm through the night . 
You guys didn t wake me up for a turn at watch last_night ($_last) . 
You needed the rest , it couldn t have been easy carrying all three of us for two days straight . 
Well yeah, but still. 
Just go to bed Kirishima , we ll wake you if we need you . 
Heaving a sigh Kirishima ($_kirishima) grabs a bedroll and blanket and settles in near where Izuku ($_izuku) has laid down his ($_izuku) . Though he ($_izuku) watches curiously as Bakugou ($_bakugou) lays his ($_izuku) down almost on top of Izuku s. 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) ! It 's not as cold here as last_night ($_last) , plus we have the fire . 
Idiot , it 's that weird presence , the closer we are to you the less it 's felt . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) raises an eyebrow , almost wanting to interject that he ($_izuku) s perfectly fine at the range he ($_izuku) is to the green haired young man , but the blushes on both of their faces has him ($_izuku) keeping his ($_izuku) mouth shut .
