The next night they stop , Midoriya ($_midoriya) takes one look at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s pained face and immediately reaches for his ($_bakugou) pack . 
I don t need your fucking help ! 
Kacchan ($_kacchan) , your wing is clearly not healing as it should . 
So? 
So sit down , and let me heal it . Properly , this time . That human sling isn t working . 
No ! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) casts a despairing glance around the clearing . His ($_midoriya) eyes land on Shouto ($_shouto) , doing his ($_midoriya) best to disappear into the shadows of the fire , and brighten . ... all right , Kacchan ($_kacchan) . I won t try to heal your wing . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) glares at him ($_midoriya) suspiciously , but lets it drop . A small smile blooms on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face . 
Shouto ($_shouto) does his ($_shouto) best to look like he ($_shouto) s absolutely engrossed in the fire and can t possibly be bothered . Midoriya_,_of_course ($_midoriya) , completely ignores this and plops down in the dirt next to him ($_shouto) . 
Todoroki ! 
... Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
What do you know about healing spells ? 
Shouto eyes him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) does not like where this is going . ... not a lot . 
Oh no , what a shame ! Everyone should know about healing spells , especially the ones that can be worked into an amulet and used by someone without magic ! 
Shouto ($_shouto) really does not like where this is going . Is that so. 
Mhm ! Ooh , I have an idea . How about I make a healing amulet , and you use it on Bakugou ($_bakugou) ? 
I don t think that s such a good idea ? 
Midoriya beams at him ($_shouto) , and really , it s not right that someone so bright and cheery can then say something as calculated and uncalled for as , It s a better idea than dropping a pocketknife . 
Shouto ($_shouto) can t deny that . ... fine . 
Thank you for your help ! 
Their nightly stops turn into medical lectures . Shouto ($_shouto) learns an astounding amount about dragon anatomy , healing magic , how Quirks can interfere with healing magic , how Quirks can enhance healing magic , healing magic , how to imbue amulets with healing magic , healing magic , and finally , healing magic . 
Oh , and how to smack Bakugou ($_bakugou) with an amulet that should instantaneously heal his ($_bakugou) wing . The sole bit of knowledge that Shouto ($_shouto) actually needs . Even though once his ($_bakugou) wing is healed they still plan to have him ($_bakugou) fly on Shinsou ($_shinsou) so he ($_bakugou) doesn t injure himself ($_bakugou) again . 
You know a lot about healing magic , Shouto ($_shouto) remarks one evening , after a short tangent had turned into a thirty minute lecture . 
Midoriya flushes . Shouto ($_shouto) blinks . What could be embarrassing about knowing how to heal? 
Ah , well , when I was younger I got injured a lot , so I guess I figured it would be easier if I just learned to how heal myself instead of going to a medic every time ! 
Across the campsite , Shinsou ($_shinsou) huffs a laugh . That s one way of putting it . 
What do you mean ? 
A grin spreads over Shinsou ($_shinsou) s face . 
He ($_shinsou) doesn t need to know , Midoriya ($_midoriya) hisses , whipping around to glare at Shinsou ($_shinsou) . 
When his ($_shinsou) Quirk came in , he ($_shinsou) couldn t use it without pulverizing his ($_shinsou) bones . Recovery Girl -- his ($_shinsou) doctor -- eventually refused to ... what was it ? Enable such heedless disregard for one s own health and wellbeing ? Something like that . She stopped healing him ($_shinsou) , but he ($_shinsou) didn t stop breaking bones . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) appears to be trying to bury his ($_midoriya) entire body under his ($_midoriya) arms . Shinsou ($_shinsou) 
Shouto ($_shouto) tilts his ($_shouto) head . Oh , so like how I learned to stitch up sword wounds . Or treat burns . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes go wide . 
Shinsou ($_shinsou) lets his ($_shinsou) head fall into his ($_shinsou) hands . How did any of you survive ? 
The making of the amulet is rather anticlimactic . Midoriya ($_midoriya) digs around in his ($_shinsou) pack and pulls out a dirty coin , then mumbles a few words over it and lets a few drops of some potion fall on it . Shouto half-expects it to flare up in a blaze , but it seems not all magic is as flashy as the Gandalf test . Instead , the potion sinks into the coin , a shimmer ripples over it , and then it s back to being a plain old coin . 
There you are , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , pressing the coin into Shouto ($_shouto) s palm . Wait until he ($_midoriya) s a dragon , and then place this on him ($_midoriya) as close to the wing joint as you can . Don t worry about holding it in place or anything . As soon as it touches you should be good to go . 
Okay , Shouto ($_shouto) says . Thanks . 
He ($_midoriya) walks up to Bakugou , sitting sullenly on the other side of the fire . Fuck you want , half n half ? 
I bet you this coin you can t shift right now , Shouto ($_shouto) says . 
Like fuck I can t ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) roars . He ($_bakugou) steps back from the fire and shifts , shaking his ($_bakugou) body like a dog shaking off water . 
Oh wow , I can t believe it , Shouto ($_shouto) deadpans . He ($_bakugou) waits for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to raise a wing , then takes aim and flings the coin . It hits dead on . 
Nice aim , Shinsou ($_shinsou) remarks . Did Izuku ($_izuku) tell you to throw it ? 
No , but it was implied , he ($_bakugou) replies . 
I didn t imply anything of the sort ! Midoriya squawks . Shouto ($_shouto) can t help but grin , ignoring Bakugou ($_bakugou) s sudden bout of explosions . 
Some gratitude . 
The days pass quicker and quicker , filled with Bakugou ($_bakugou) s grumbling and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s smiles and the wind on Shouto ($_shouto) s face as they fly through the wide , wide sky . 
It s hardly anything at first just a pinprick star at night , a wisp of cloud in the day . Shouto ($_shouto) thinks nothing of it . As the days go by , though , the speck gets bigger and bigger until Shouto ($_shouto) realizes that it s not a cloud or a star but -- 
"Yuuei! Midoriya crows . 
A giant island of reddish rock floats in the air . If Shouto ($_shouto) squints , he can see patches of green that might be forests . Thin streams of silver run off the sides , falling down to meet the lake far below . In the center , a tall spire of rock rises up . 
Walls of the same red rock run around the edge of the island , rough and curving in slightly . Shouto ($_shouto) can only see one opening , guarded by a hovering dragon . Her scales gleam in the sunlight , black and pink and white . 
As they get closer , Shouto ($_shouto) s heart beats faster and faster . This is Yuuei ($_yuuei) . This is where Enji ($_enji) can t touch him ($_enji) , where towers can t hold him ($_enji) , where dragons fly free and magic runs wild . 
... Izuku ($_izuku) ? Is that Izuku ($_izuku) ? 
Ochako ($_ochako) ? 
Oh my God , you re back ! 
Shouto ($_shouto) only has time to think I ($_shouto) m going to die before the dragon is leaping at Izuku ($_izuku) , latching onto him ($_shouto) and bowling him ($_shouto) over . While still suspended in midair . With Shouto ($_shouto) on his ($_shouto) back . 
Careful , Ochako ($_ochako) , careful ! Midoriya ($_midoriya) says with a laugh , swinging his ($_midoriya) tail and steadying himself ($_midoriya) . 
Wha-Oh ! Who s this ? she ($_midoriya) exclaims , catching sight of Shouto_gripping ($_shouto) onto the harness for dear life . She ($_midoriya) peers at him ($_midoriya) . Is this your ($_midoriya) friend ? Baku . . to? He ($_midoriya) doesn t really smell like a dragon 
Oi ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) splutters from Shinsou s back . It s Bakugou , and I m not that shitty extra ! 
MIdoriya ($_midoriya) just laughs . This is Todoroki , the prince Bakugou ($_bakugou) captured . 
Her ($_midoriya) eyes go wide . He ($_midoriya) captured a prince ? Izuku ($_izuku) , what kind of childhood friends did you ($_izuku) have ? 
I ($_izuku) did not capture a prince ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) yells . 
According to Enji ($_enji) s propaganda , you ($_izuku) did , Shouto ($_shouto) mutters . 
`` Wow , sounds like quite the story ! Come on , let s get Recovery Girl to look you ($_izuku) over , and then go see your ($_izuku) mom . She s missed you ($_izuku) so much ! 
Ah , we ll need to talk to the Council first , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . 
The dragon bites her lip . Oh. Right , she says . Her gaze darts to Shouto . Good luck , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
Shouto ($_shouto) frowns . 
The Council ? 
The dragon -LRB- Uraraka , Shouto learns -RRB- , leads them through the streets of Yuuei ($_yuuei) . As they walk , she points out this monument here and that really good ice cream shop there and ooh this thrift store has the best deals on magical jewelry and 
She and the Yuueian dragons chatter away about Aoyama s latest nonsense or how oblivious Mirio and Tamaki are , catching them up on the latest gossip . Bakugou ($_bakugou) , having never met most of these people , is fuming , sparks popping on his ($_bakugou) palms . Shouto ($_shouto) s not too bothered ; it ($_shouto) saves him ($_bakugou) having to make conversation , and lets his ($_bakugou) attention rest on the city around them . 
There are no humans to be seen , the Yuueians evidently preferring their dragon forms . They fill the sky , big , small , short , long , scaled , smooth , iridescent , dull , every color imaginable 
Yuuei ($_yuuei) isn t anything like the capital city of Endeavor ($_endeavor) , dim and dreary and overcrowded in his ($_yuuei) memories . There are no sharply-defined roads , only the rust-red earth and patches of green vegetation . What he ($_yuuei) had initially thought were walls around the edge of the island are caves , opening up towards the center , with dragons flying in and out . Homes , maybe . 
As they go farther , there are more and more chunks of rocks floating in the air , like a giant fist smashed into the ground and the rubble was frozen in the air before it could fall back down . They vary in size , from boulders as tall as Shouto ($_shouto) to massive rocks that could match any of the buildings in Endeavor ($_endeavor) . The larger ones have been carved out , making spaces for shops and homes . Dragons fly freely , darting through the rocks with ease , a constant stream of color , rumbling voices bouncing off the rock and filling the air . 
It s amazing . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s never imagined anything like this . 
They fly , and Shouto ($_shouto) marvels , until they reach the tall spire in the center . 
All right , here we are ! Uraraka chirps. 
Council s inside , I sent a message once you ($_uraraka) arrived . 
Once we reminded you ($_uraraka) , you ($_uraraka) mean , Shinsou ($_shinsou) says with a small smile . Uraraka ($_uraraka) rolls her ($_shinsou) eyes good-naturedly . 
I ll wait for you ($_uraraka) to finish , okay ? 
Thanks , Ochako , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , grinning . He ($_midoriya) lifts a wing to give her ($_shinsou) a quick hug , and then they walk into the spire . 
The spire has been carefully hollowed out , intricate designs etched onto the walls and delicate openings providing ventilation . Just as the walls around the island have caves carved into them , the walls of the spire have chambers hollowed out . A central staircase spirals up , with thin paths branching out to connect to the walls . 
The dragons , of course , don t bother with the stairs and just fly up . 
They don t stop until they ve reached the very top and flown out into the open air . The top of the spire has been leveled out into an immense plateau , far above the rest of the island . 
The Council sits there . 
Every dragon there is massive , grown large with their years . They spread over the flat red stone in a jumbled half circle . An enormous red , blue , and yellow dragon sits in the center , two golden yellow horns spiraling high from the crest of his skull . 
Shouto ($_shouto) has never felt quite so small . 
Midoriya Izuku , a gray dragon with yellow markings around his eyes says calmly . How went the Hero s Quest ? 
I have returned successful ! MIdoriya ($_midoriya) proclaims . 
Young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) , well done ! the largest dragon says . My boy , you ve made me proud ! 
The gray dragon eyes them , ignoring the cheers around him . I see that you have retrieved Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
`` I have ! Midoriya ($_midoriya) is beaming , his wings twitching with excitement . 
Who else have you retrieved ? 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s smile instantly becomes strained . 
He smells of humans and magic . Midoriya ($_midoriya) , why have you brought a human into Yuuei ($_yuuei) ? 
It was the best option at the time , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , flaring his ($_midoriya) wings the slightest bit . All will be explained in my report . 
Oh , I do love best options ! a tiny , white , mouse-like dragon says . Shouto ($_shouto) blinks ; he ($_shouto) hadn t noticed this dragon , sitting primly in the shadow of the large yellow one . Let s hear the summary , and we can deal with the paperwork later . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) tells the_Council_of_the_uneventful_journey_to_Shouto ($_the) s tower , their ($_the) surprise when they ($_the) found Bakugou and the prince he ($_shouto) was guarding , their ($_the) attempt to lift the spell and subsequent realization , the rather more eventful journey back to Yuuei , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) s injury . 
Shouto ($_shouto) notices that Midoriya ($_midoriya) does his ($_shouto) absolute best to portray him ($_shouto) in a positive view . He ($_shouto) s not sure how much it s going to influence the clearly skeptical council , but it is appreciated . 
Hmm. 
My , how interesting ! the white dragon chirps . You say the curse was the work of a Quirk ? 
Yes , so we couldn t break it . 
I see , I see ! Aizawa_,_if_you_would_be_so_kind ($_be) 
The gray dragon heaves himself ($_be) up and slinks over the plateau until he ($_be) s close enough to bite Shouto ($_shouto) . He ($_be) crouches down and peers at him ($_be) , like a cat eyeing a bird . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) , come here . His ($_be) voice is terse . Bakugou ($_bakugou) doesn t even bother protesting , coming to stand at Shouto ($_shouto) s side . 
The dragon s eyes flare open , a bloody red pinning Shouto ($_shouto) down . He ($_be) opens his ($_be) jaw . A red mist comes billowing out , stark against his ($_be) white fangs , and settles over Shouto and Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
Distantly , Shouto ($_shouto) can feel something almost unraveling . 
The collar around Bakugou ($_bakugou) s neck crumbles into dust . Aizawa ($_aizawa) lets his ($_aizawa) eyes fade , lids drooping lazily , and sits back . 
An air of tense curiosity hangs over the plateau , every dragon waiting for something more , whether dangerous or benign . You never quite knew what a spell would do on its way out . 
What this spell does , apparently , is nothing , and the tension is promptly broken by the large yellow dragon standing up and declaring , Fantastic ! Now , how about a celebration for a new successful Hero ? '' 
Shouto ($_shouto) spends the celebration watching Midoriya ($_midoriya) greet all his ($_midoriya) old friends and important people from under a piece of red rock . 
He ($_midoriya) hasn t seen this many people since Endeavor ($_endeavor) , after all , and it s a little overwhelming . 
Really overwhelming. 
Hence the sitting under a rock . 
Bakugou , the only other person who had also been around exactly one person for the majority of his developmental years and could therefore sympathize or at least complain with him , had been dragged away by a healer the second the Council released them . 
He watches Midoriya ($_midoriya) laugh with Uraraka , joke around with a rough red dragon , have what appears to be a cheerful yelling match with a sleek silver and blue dragon , argue with a pink dragon with odd eyes -LRB- something about her babies ? There were no babies on the journey , Shouto ($_shouto) s sure he would have remembered -RRB- , and generally be a social dragonfly . 
He looks so natural out there , talking and laughing and smiling . Shouto ($_shouto) s not sure whether he s jealous of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s easy social skills or jealous of the people on the receiving end of them . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s not sure whether he s jealous at all , really , but that s the best name he has for what he s feeling right now . 
He spends some time sitting beneath the rock , until the stars begin to fade and the celebration begins to die down . He stands , stretching out his cramped legs . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) , may I have a word ? 
It s the grey dragon Aizawa . A prick of unease needles at Shouto ($_shouto) . Aizawa ($_aizawa) doesn t wait for an answer before continuing . There was one thing that Nedzu ($_nedzu) thought better not to address in front of your companions . Todoroki ($_todoroki) , where are you from ? 
Why? Shouto ($_shouto) is not sure where this is going , but he ($_shouto) is quite sure that he ($_shouto) doesn t like it . 
We re curious . 
Well , that s a lie if Shouto ($_shouto) s ever heard one . But from the way Aizawa is holding himself ($_shouto) , Shouto ($_shouto) doubts he ($_shouto) ll be able to leave without answering . 
Even so , the unease is now a knife in his ($_shouto) gut . 
... Endeavor . 
Aizawa ($_aizawa) sighs . Shouto tenses . I thought you smelled like fire , Aizawa ($_aizawa) grumbles . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was not the only dragon to be kidnapped by Endeavor ($_endeavor) , Todoroki . But he ($_bakugou) was the only one to be freed . 
Shouto ($_shouto) really does not like this . 
Nedzu ($_nedzu) thinks you ll make a fine bargaining chip . 
The knife twists , Aizawa ($_aizawa) s eyes gleam , and Shouto blacks out . 
For all the splendor of Yuuei ($_yuuei) , their jails seem to be just as dingy and drab as everyone else s. 
Shouto ($_shouto) sits in the corner of his ($_shouto) cell , the cold chill of the rough stone bench biting at his ($_shouto) thighs . He ($_shouto) s just shy of numb . 
He ($_shouto) doesn t know what he ($_shouto) had expected . Of course dragons weren t going to be very welcoming to the son of the man that captured dozens of them . Midoriya ($_midoriya) must have been the exception to the rule ; even Shinsou ($_shinsou) had been so suspicious of him ($_shouto) at first , and it was only because he ($_shouto) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) had grown up together that there was any sort of trust between them . 
He ($_shouto) shifts on the cold bench . The stone seems rougher every minute . 
Would they bother to speak up for him ($_shouto) ? Probably not. Bakugou ($_bakugou) should be happy to be away from the prince he ($_shouto) d been chained to for years . His ($_shouto) face had lit up in joy once Aizawa ($_aizawa) had erased the spell . 
-LRB- Shouto ($_shouto) s not going to lie , he ($_shouto) does feel ... lighter , in a way , without the spell . -RRB- 
-LRB- Maybe magical beings were more sensitive to that ? -RRB- 
Wait. Do they even know that he ($_shouto) s gone ? 
Aizawa ($_aizawa) had approached him ($_shouto) quietly , discreetly . None of the dragons he ($_shouto) knew were around . 
They didn t know . 
Shouto ($_shouto) knocks his ($_shouto) head back against the wall . 
Here he ($_shouto) is , miles and miles away from the tower , in a place where he ($_shouto) had been told he ($_shouto) could be free , just as trapped as before . 
Three days pass . The_guard ($_shouto) is a dark , birdlike dragon who mutters what a mad banquet of darkness whenever anything happens . It s an odd verbal tic , but then so is Bakugou s swearing habit . His ($_shouto) cell does not get any less cold , but he ($_shouto) is given blankets and decent meals . The standards are not very high for imprisonment , but Yuuei ($_yuuei) seems determined to push them higher . 
Shouto ($_shouto) is lying on the bench , staring at the ceiling , just like the other nights , when he ($_shouto) hears it ($_shouto) . 
Scales slide over the stone floor of the hallway . It sounds like more than one dragon ; it can t be just the guard . 
What are they here for ? Are they taking away the pretense of blankets and bread and showing that dragons can be just as cruel as humans ? Are they going to torture him ($_shouto) , try to drag any information they can about Endeavor out of him ($_shouto) ? 
The sound gets louder . 
Shouto ($_shouto) carefully gets up from the bench . 
There s nothing he ($_shouto) can use as a weapon in the cell , but if he ($_shouto) throws the blanket over the first head to poke into his ($_shouto) cell , maybe he ($_shouto) can cause a slight distraction . Why now? Why not the first night , the second night , why put him ($_shouto) in a cell at all ? 
The scales stop , right outside his ($_shouto) cell . Shouto ($_shouto) crouches by the door , blanket bundled in his ($_shouto) arms . A muffled whispering , metal clinking , hinges creaking 
Shouto flings the blanket and ducks under the dragon s legs . 
What the - 
Whoa! 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) , it ($_todoroki) s us , calm down ! 
Shouto doesn t bother looking back , more focused on sprinting away from the dragons . 
Hitoshi , could you 
On it . Todoroki ($_todoroki) . 
Shouto ($_shouto) comes to a sudden stop . Why was he running , again ? 
Ooh , Shinsou ($_shinsou) , you ve gotten stronger ! 
Come on , you two , before he starts running again ! 
Those voices sound familiar . 
Shouto ($_shouto) can t help himself ($_shouto) . He turns around , and his jaw drops . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Shinsou ($_shinsou) . And , oddly enough , Uraraka ($_uraraka) instead of Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
What are you doing here ? Shouto hisses , stepping back . 
It s a rescue mission , of course , Midoriya ($_midoriya) whispers . We re getting you out ! 
How did you 
Uraraka s head jolts up . No time ! Tokoyami s coming . 
Shit ! 
We ll explain later , Midoriya ($_midoriya) promises , scooping up Shouto ($_shouto) and dropping him ($_midoriya) on his ($_midoriya) back . It s oddly reminiscent of their departure from his ($_midoriya) tower , if much less painful . Trust us ! 
What other choice does Shouto ($_shouto) have ? 
-LRB- And would he ($_midoriya) really choose any differently ? -RRB- 
They make their way through the jail , corridors twisting and turning . Shouto ($_shouto) tries to keep track of their path , but he ($_shouto) loses it after they make four consecutive rights and somehow don t end up where they were before . 
Before long , they re out of the prison and slinking across the floor of the central spire -LRB- and he ($_shouto) realizes that s how all the turns were possible , the floor was steadily sloping up -RRB- . They stick to the shadows , avoiding anything that looks even remotely like a dragon , until they re through the door and into open air . 
Yuuei ($_yuuei) is quiet at night_,_lights_shining_from_caves_,_but_few_dragons_in_the_sky ($_,) . They make it ($_,) to the gate safely . 
Shouto ($_shouto) almost swallows his ($_shouto) tongue in shock when a rough red dragon pops up out of seemingly nowhere . 
You got him ($_shouto) ? he ($_shouto) asks . 
We got him ($_shouto) . Thanks for covering for us , Kirishima ($_kirishima) ! Uraraka ($_uraraka) says . 
Take care of Kacchan , Midoriya ($_midoriya) calls , already turning and spreading his ($_midoriya) wings . Don t let him ($_midoriya) do anything stupid . Help him ($_midoriya) become a Hero . 
He ($_midoriya) ll be the manliest Hero ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) promises , grinning . Stay safe , you guys ! 
You too , Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
And then they ($_kirishima) re flying off into the boundless sky once again .
