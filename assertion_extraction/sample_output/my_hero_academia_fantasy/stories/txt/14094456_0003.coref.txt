Katsuki ($_katsuki) crouched , muscles tensed as his ($_katsuki) eyes focused in on his ($_katsuki) prey . He ($_katsuki) knelt slightly closer , not enough to catch any attention , and raised his ($_katsuki) right hand . 
Wait for it . 
Wait for it . 
Now! 
His ($_katsuki) right arm shot into the water , sharp nails digging into the fish s flesh , and quickly wrenched it out . The carp flailed for a moment as it fought its demise in his ($_katsuki) hand , but it was no use . 
Nice catch , Mitsuru noted from her ($_mitsuru) perch on his ($_katsuki) shoulder . 
Thanks , he ($_katsuki) mumbled . He ($_katsuki) held the fish up to her ($_mitsuru) once its wriggling had stopped . 
Her ($_mitsuru) eyes lit up as she ($_mitsuru) snatched it into her ($_mitsuru) jaws . She ($_mitsuru) quickly leapt onto the riverbank to gobble it up . He ($_katsuki) watched her ($_mitsuru) make quick work of the fish , even picking its bones completely clean . Her ($_mitsuru) long tongue ran over her ($_mitsuru) lips as a happy trill rumbled in her ($_mitsuru) throat . 
That was delicious . I could go for another one . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) rolled his ($_katsuki) eyes . At this rate you re going to get fat . He ($_katsuki) smirked when he ($_katsuki) noticed her ($_mitsuru) eyes narrow at him ($_katsuki) . What? It s just the truth - 
He ($_katsuki) barely dodged the large tail suddenly being swiped at him ($_katsuki) . A shadow blotted out the sun as Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) stood above him ($_katsuki) in her ($_mitsuru) normal form . 
Her ($_mitsuru) shifting speed had definitely improved . He ($_katsuki) hadn t even seen the magical residue surround her ($_mitsuru) . 
I am not fat , she ($_mitsuru) hissed , cuffing him ($_katsuki) over the head . You are just ridiculously skinny . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) bared his ($_katsuki) teeth at her ($_mitsuru) . Compared to drakes he ($_katsuki) was skinny , and he ($_katsuki) didn t have enough knowledge of humans to refute her ($_mitsuru) words . 
The only humans he ($_katsuki) d seen were a handful of vile hunters looking to kill for sport he ($_katsuki) d never bothered to focus on what they looked like and those from the few books he ($_katsuki) d been given by the older drakes . Compared to the hero All Might pictured in one of those books , he ($_katsuki) was thin . 
Damn . 
Whatever , he ($_katsuki) hissed . He ($_katsuki) hunched back down near the water s edge , but their spat had frightened off most of the fish . Only his ($_katsuki) reflection stared back at him ($_katsuki) in the clear waters . 
So much for fishing 
Perhaps we should try that blackberry patch again ? 
Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) , I will rip your scales off if you - 
A sudden screeching echoing through the forest instantly cut off his thoughts as a flurry of startled birds flew from their perches . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) whirled around , dagger already in hand as he ($_katsuki) narrowed his ($_katsuki) eyes . Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) was by his ($_mitsuru) side , angling her ($_mitsuru) body to protect his ($_mitsuru) back as they waited for something to pop out at them . 
The forest had gone quiet , eerily so . None of the usual birdsong or chattering of insects filled the air . 
It was as if the forest was dead . 
What the hell was that ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) pushed the thought towards Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) as a minute passed by with no sign they were going to be attacked . 
I m not sure . Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) sent back , keeping her ($_mitsuru) hackles raised . Whatever it was , it didn t sound good . 
They were in a prime position for battle with no trees directly around them to hinder their movements , but they were out in the open and easier targets for non-forest dwellers . 
But it was as if whatever had made the distressed noise no longer existed . There was no other sound of the sort as they waited . 
If it was a forest dweller , than it was probably dead . 
But Katsuki ($_katsuki) had never heard a sound like it . 
He ($_katsuki) debated his ($_katsuki) options . He ($_katsuki) could go investigate with a shifted Mitsuru to avoid being heard , or they could continue waiting for something to happen . It was a decision he ($_katsuki) d never had to make before what with the forest being as peaceful as it was but the first choice sounded better than waiting for something to happen . 
That choice wouldn t be made . 
Suddenly a prickling sensation swept through his body , sending him into a crouch with a pained gasp . He instantly felt Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) s shock and concern poke at his mind , but the prickling was far stronger and completely overtook her ($_mitsuru) attempts to calm him . 
It was as if the very earth s pain had suddenly clutched onto him and pushed everything it had ever felt into him . It was unbearable , but underneath every layer of pain wracking his body , Katsuki ($_katsuki) felt a grimness he d never experienced before . 
Something terrible had happened to a drake . 
We need to head back , he managed to gasp out , fighting off the nausea pooling in his belly . Something s wrong . 
Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) s eyes widened , but she ($_mitsuru) quickly nodded in response . She ($_mitsuru) stooped down for him to clamber on before giving a great flap of her ($_mitsuru) wings and sending them airborne , nearly sending him flying off . 
Usually a swift trip through the air with Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) pushing her ($_mitsuru) limits sent his ($_mitsuru) adrenaline skyrocketing , but now he ($_mitsuru) could hardly focus on even holding on with the pain assaulting his ($_mitsuru) mind . 
Before he ($_mitsuru) knew it , the green below them turned to brown as they reached the clan s home . A few mature drakes usually could be found on the small plateau overlooking the forest throughout the day , but now it looked as if the entire clan was present and circled around a single drake . 
That didn t bode well . 
Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) gently landed away from the older drakes , minding his ($_mitsuru) state . Katsuki ($_katsuki) could feel her ($_katsuki) tampered fear as she ($_katsuki) approached the older dragons , and he ($_katsuki) knew she ($_katsuki) could feel his ($_katsuki) . 
What s going on ? she ($_katsuki) asked the nearest drake , a black adult named Haruka ($_haruka) . 
Haruka ($_haruka) turned her ($_katsuki) golden eyes towards the two . She ($_katsuki) studied Katsuki ($_katsuki) for a moment if she ($_katsuki) noticed his ($_katsuki) pained state , she ($_katsuki) gave no indication of it before meeting Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) s gaze . The look in the older drake s eyes was unreadable . There was an attack . One of Riko ($_riko) s eggs was stolen . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) felt a rush of pain assault him ($_katsuki) again , but Haruka ($_haruka) s words made the rational part of his ($_katsuki) mind stutter . 
An attack ? An egg stolen ? 
W-what do you mean ? Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) gasped . 
Haruka ($_haruka) sighed and opened her ($_haruka) mouth to respond when another shrill cry pierced the air . 
A red drake collapsed farther from them where more of the older dragons had gathered . She ($_haruka) let out a pitiful wail as the other drakes tried to comfort her ($_haruka) . But few knew what to say. Never had such an incident occurred , at least from what Katsuki ($_katsuki) knew . 
Suddenly the drakes moved out of the way as the Guardian Akari approached the fallen drake . The elder looked down at Riko , her ($_haruka) eyes filled with a deep sadness . Akari ($_akari) let out a gentle coo as she ($_haruka) began dragging her ($_haruka) long tail along Riko ($_riko) s scales in an attempt to comfort her ($_haruka) . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) peered through the pained haze fogging his ($_katsuki) vision . He ($_katsuki) caught Akari ($_akari) s eyes trained on him ($_katsuki) . She ($_haruka) blinked once at him ($_katsuki) before closing her ($_haruka) eyes for a few moments . 
Suddenly the pain disappeared . Katsuki ($_katsuki) tensed , awaiting another wave , but slowly pushed himself ($_katsuki) up as none came . He ($_katsuki) turned back to catch the elder s eyes again , but she ($_haruka) was already focused back on Riko ($_riko) . 
Haruka ($_haruka) began cooing from beside him ($_katsuki) . The other drakes quickly caught on until the soothing noise weaved itself into a calming blanket and settled upon Riko ($_riko) . 
The drake s wails turned to quiet whines until only the trembling of her ($_haruka) body showed her ($_haruka) grieving . 
Akari ($_akari) lifted her ($_akari) right claw and instantly the song stopped . She ($_akari) lifted her ($_akari) gaze , sweeping it across all the gathered drakes before lowering her ($_akari) claw . 
Today we have seen a tragedy . I know many of you still do not know everything of what happened , but it is something we must all know . Akari ($_akari) stopped for a moment as if to collect her ($_akari) thoughts . A human discovered our home . Somehow it evaded detection during its journey through the forest and into Riko ($_riko) s cave . 
Instantly murmurs rushed through the drakes . Katsuki ($_katsuki) felt a few eyes turn his ($_katsuki) direction , but he ($_katsuki) could hardly focus on that . 
A human had made its way to the drake s home . A human had , against all odds , ventured deep into the forest and to the dragon caves to steal an egg . And it hadn t even been detected ? 
In all his life , the farthest Katsuki ($_katsuki) knew of a human getting through the forest was barely 50 steps . The forest dwellers were quick to send a message that would reach the drakes who would promptly frighten off the human . There had been hunters throughout the years , determined to kill and skin the creatures of the forest , but they were easy to deal with . 
So how the hell did one human manage to steal from a dragon s cave without getting caught ? 
I know you are all confused , Akari ($_akari) suddenly continued , hushing the whispers . But we will find out how this happened . One of our eggs was stolen before , and we were quick to bring it home . This shall be no different . 
The guardian s words quickly calmed the frazzled drakes . Katsuki ($_katsuki) noticed a few still sending looks his ($_katsuki) direction , and a few even seemed to look at Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) , but he ($_katsuki) felt better with Akari ($_akari) s words . She was easily the dragon he ($_katsuki) looked up to most , right after his ($_katsuki) Lord . 
The ground suddenly began rumbling beneath them speak of the god and everyone quieted as their Lord spoke . 
Our Lord is in agreement , Akari ($_akari) said . We will find this human and bring our own home . 
Pleased rumbles sounded in many of the drakes throats . Katsuki ($_katsuki) even heard the typically stern and cold Haruka ($_haruka) trill happily . 
She certainly has a way with words , doesn t she ? Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) voiced in his ($_mitsuru) head . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) was caught off guard by the sudden voice he ($_katsuki) hadn t been expecting Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) to speak through their bond but quickly brushed it off . Yeah , but I still want to know how a fucking human managed to get past our defenses and steal from us . 
Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) sent a wave a calm towards him ($_katsuki) likely to calm his ($_katsuki) sudden spike of anger but he ($_katsuki) could still feel traces of her ($_mitsuru) own uneasiness pushing at his ($_katsuki) mind . I do as well , but the elders will have it handled . You heard Akari ($_akari) . They had an egg stolen once before and they brought it back . This will be no different . 
Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) continued sending him ($_katsuki) small waves of comfort to calm him ($_katsuki) through their bond , but Katsuki ($_katsuki) knew it wasn t because of the stolen egg . 
He ($_katsuki) had never experienced the strange spell that had suddenly struck his ($_katsuki) body . 
The pain had been agonizing , but even as he ($_katsuki) looked down at his ($_katsuki) exposed torso , there were no visible wounds that he ($_katsuki) d associate with pain . It was as if the terrible feeling consuming his ($_katsuki) body only moments ago had only been part of one of his ($_katsuki) nightmares . 
So what had happened to him ($_katsuki) ? 
Perhaps you should speak to the guardian Akari_about_it ($_akari) ? Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) voiced in his ($_mitsuru) head , cutting through his ($_mitsuru) thoughts . She ($_mitsuru) is very knowledgeable about the world , so it s likely she ($_mitsuru) will know of what happened to you . 
Oh stop your worrying you lump of fat . I m fine . 
Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) gave a low hiss in response , but it lacked its usual annoyance . She ($_mitsuru) obviously wasn t convinced . 
It was hard to convince her ($_mitsuru) though , when he wasn t entirely convinced by himself either . 
It had been two days . Two days of spending any moment he was free studying the book and still Izuku was no closer to figuring out anything about it . 
Maybe he had been too sure of himself . He d only ever read the popular books sent in from the capitol . What good would any of that do in trying to unravel the secrets of a book a seasoned traveler had no luck with ? Maybe he would never figure out anything with the book . Maybe it would only add to the long list of failures he had in his life . Maybe-
Snickering jolted Izuku ($_izuku) from his ($_izuku) thoughts . He ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) downward gaze up towards a group of men his ($_izuku) age . They sneered at him ($_izuku) and whispered to each other , prompting another round of raucous laughter from them . 
Izuku ($_izuku) quickly focused his ($_izuku) eyes back on the road and shrunk in on himself ($_izuku) , hurrying his ($_izuku) steps to escape their torment . It still hurt being looked down as the village outcast , even with the harassment going on nearly 10 years now . 
The harassment to his ($_izuku) face anyway . 
He ($_izuku) was thankful his ($_izuku) mother was oblivious to the teasing the people his ($_izuku) age especially liked to inflict on him ($_izuku) , but sometimes he ($_izuku) wished there was someone on his ($_izuku) side . He ($_izuku) thought Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) likely knew about it ($_shuzenji) , if the sympathetic looks and allowing him ($_izuku) special privileges was any indication , but he ($_izuku) didn t want to trouble the elderly woman with his ($_izuku) problems . She was respected by everyone in the village , and Izuku ($_izuku) wouldn t be able to deal with any ire directed towards her because of him ($_izuku) . 
There had been someone once a person who had stood up for him ($_izuku) against the bullies . 
But that time was long gone . 
Izuku ($_izuku) heaved a sigh , slowing his ($_izuku) steps when he ($_izuku) was out of the group s range . Even the welcoming sight of the library ahead wasn t enough to brighten his ($_izuku) gloomy mood . 
Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) immediately looked up from the papers on her desk as he ($_izuku) walked in . The silver quill stopped its movement . Her lips turned downwards into a frown , likely seeing the troubled expression on his ($_izuku) face . 
What s wrong Izuku ($_izuku) ? You don t usually come here looking so sad . 
Izuku ($_izuku) tried giving her a smile . It s nothing Shuzenji , he ($_izuku) said . I m just having a bad morning today , that s all . 
She didn t look convinced , making Izuku ($_izuku) turn his ($_izuku) eyes away from her expression . 
If you say so dear . 
Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) turned back to her papers , a letter it ($_shuzenji) looked like from what he ($_izuku) could see , allowing Izuku ($_izuku) a slight reprieve . He ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) attention to the bookcases , heading towards the herb and plants section . 
One part of the book in his ($_izuku) language included a list of three items . Two were plants , making it likely to be part of a recipe . Izuku ($_izuku) knew the basic plants around the kingdom , more of those around his ($_izuku) village than anything , but he ($_izuku) was no specialist . Thankfully , the library had a rich section of all sorts of information pertaining to plants . Most focused on medicinal properties a topic he ($_izuku) d noticed Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) seemed particularly interested in but he ($_izuku) wasn t sure if the list was for medicinal purposes or not . 
It didn t help that most of the page had been ripped out . 
But why the mysterious book written in an extinct language would include a recipe of sorts , Izuku ($_izuku) had no idea . Finding out what the plants listed were used for would hopefully help solve that question . 
If only to assure himself ($_izuku) he ($_izuku) could do at least one thing with the book . 
His ($_izuku) eyes ran down the spines of the books neatly filed away , focusing in on a thick brown one with silver lettering . 
The Almanac of Plantae : Special Edition by R.G. , he ($_izuku) mumbled under his ($_izuku) breath , slipping it out of the shelf . It was heavy and seemed promising . 
Izuku ($_izuku) walked towards the table , carefully setting his ($_izuku) bag on it beside the almanac . He ($_izuku) sat down and opened the book . His ($_izuku) finger ran down the table of contents page to the section labeled herbs , and then flipped to the correct page . 
One of the plants listed in the mysterious book was ashitaba , an_herb_Izuku ($_an) had read about once but didn t pay much attention to . From what he ($_an) knew about it , it wasn t an uncommon plant . 
So why would it be listed ? 
It was one of the first herbs listed on the page so Izuku ($_izuku) began to quietly read aloud . Ashitaba ($_ashitaba) is a common herb found in warm , humid climates . It ($_ashitaba) is typically found growing near the ocean , making it a popular addition to cuisine in harbor cities . It ($_ashitaba) is commonly used to treat a variety of illnesses , including that which ails the stomach . It ($_ashitaba) has also been claimed to promote longevity . 
Interesting , but it didn t exactly help . 
Have you taken an interest in herbs ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) jumped with a startled squeak , nearly falling out of the chair . He ($_izuku) whirled his ($_izuku) wide eyes towards Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) . The old woman smiled at him ($_izuku) , amusement clear on her face . Izuku ($_izuku) felt his ($_izuku) cheeks flush . 
A-ah , Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) , you startled me , he ($_izuku) stammered . 
I can see that , she chuckled . Very focused already hm ? 
Y-yes . He ($_izuku) swallowed nervously , turning back towards the book . I um , just heard someone say something about ashitaba the other day and I was just a bit curious because we don t have this plant around here so I wondered where it could be found and - 
Izuku ($_izuku) . Her voice instantly quieted his rambling . If you don t want to tell me , that s fine . This old woman was curious , that s all . You ve never shown much interest in studying medicine before . 
Izuku ($_izuku) couldn t meet her gaze . I m sorry Shuzenji . I just 
Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) gave him a knowing look . It is alright to hide the truth if you must , but trying to cover it with lies will only cause you pain . She laid a hand on his shoulder . Take this advice from an old woman . 
He nodded , keeping his eyes trained towards the almanac . 
Good , now I will leave you to this . But if you ever need help , I will be more than happy to provide it . She pat his shoulder gently and started walking away . 
W-wait ! 
Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) turned , meeting nervous green eyes . Yes Izuku? 
I Izuku bit his lip . The woman stood , waiting patiently . Her very presence was calming , so why was he still anxious to tell her about the mysterious book ? Dragon ($_dragon) s Claw ($_claw) . 
She raised a brow . Dragon ($_dragon) s Claw ($_claw) ? 
He nodded , averting his gaze . It s an ancient writing , right ? 
Yes , she said slowly . Dragon ($_dragon) s Claw was a language used long ago before it ($_dragon) became lost to the ages . It ($_dragon) is said only the very dragons that created it ($_dragon) can understand it ($_dragon) now , but no text remains with it ($_dragon) . 
Izuku ($_izuku) s fists clenched his ($_izuku) trousers , knuckles turning white against the dark blue . So there isn t anyone who can translate it ? 
No . Such a thing isn t possible . The only humans ever known to be capable of reading it were the legendary dragon riders , men who could tame the beasts . But they are long gone now , faded into mere stories . Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) s stare bore into him ($_izuku) . Why do you ($_izuku) ask Izuku ($_izuku) ? 
The taste of copper flooded his ($_izuku) mouth as his ($_izuku) teeth pierced his ($_izuku) lip . I read something about it in a book . I was just curious if it actually existed . 
Izuku ($_izuku) felt awful for lying , and he ($_izuku) knew Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) could tell he ($_izuku) was lying through his ($_izuku) teeth . He ($_izuku) could feel her disappointed gaze , but he ($_izuku) couldn t find it in himself ($_izuku) to tell her the truth . 
But why , he ($_izuku) didn t know . 
Well , I wish you ($_izuku) luck with your ($_izuku) studies , she said . 
Izuku ($_izuku) s gaze finally drifted upwards as she shuffled away . The mysterious book s presence in his ($_izuku) bag suddenly seemed heavier , as if it was pushing down on his ($_izuku) chest . 
Was it worth learning more about this book if it meant lying to one of the only people in his ($_izuku) life who cared about him ($_izuku) ? 
He ($_izuku) shook his ($_izuku) head . Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) had been merely disappointed , but that wasn t enough to make her hate him ($_izuku) was it ? Thinking the kind , old librarian would turn on him ($_izuku) so quickly was ridiculous . He ($_izuku) would just have to properly apologize to her later . 
But for now , he ($_izuku) still had some research to do . 
Izuku ($_izuku) flipped through several pages until he ($_izuku) saw what he ($_izuku) was looking for . Lotus ($_lotus) seeds . 
Lotus ($_lotus) seeds weren t so common in his ($_izuku) village , but he ($_izuku) knew they were farther to the east where bogs were a natural part of the landscape . 
Yet another common herb . Why would it be listed then ? 
Lotus ($_lotus) seeds grow in shallow and murky waters , typically that of marshes or bogs . They re commonly used in dishes for extra nutrition . Their use also extends to that of medicine . Lotus ($_lotus) seeds are said to promote longevity , adding to their popularity . 
Izuku ($_izuku) s mumbling died down . 
Both plants listed were common in both cooking and medicine , which didn t exactly help him . With all of their practical uses , it was nearly impossible to discern why they would be listed . 
That meant it all came down to the third item listed on the remainder of the torn page . 
Basilisk venom . 
Izuku ($_izuku) had read tales of the deadly creatures , but he ($_izuku) knew of no one that had ever seen one . Basilisks lived far north in the Beast s Forest , a place treacherous enough on its own without the added creatures roaming in its darkness . It was said to be the most dangerous forest in all the land , even more than the Shrouded Grove where the western dragons lived . 
A cold finger traced his spine , sending a chill sweeping through his body . 
He d never heard or read of anyone slaying the beast and taking its venom , but it could be possible . Izuku ($_izuku) recalled reading once about some venoms having healing properties if taken care of correctly . 
That meant this list was for a medicine . But a medicine for what ? 
Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) would probably know . 
Izuku ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) head towards her . She was still busy with the papers spread on her desk and didn t seem to notice his ($_izuku) gaze . 
Izuku ($_izuku) hesitated for a moment before carefully pulling the mysterious book from his ($_izuku) bag . It almost seemed to taunt him ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) looked upon its worn cover even the dull gemstones seemed to twinkle at him ($_izuku) in the light . 
It was stupid to refuse her help , especially when he ($_izuku) desperately needed it . He ($_izuku) still had no idea what this book was about other possibly a collection of medicine recipes that couldn t be translated . 
But Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) was very wise and kind , and even though he ($_izuku) still felt split between telling her about the book or keeping it a secret , he ($_izuku) would show her this book . 
His ($_izuku) mind made up at least before he ($_izuku) could change it he ($_izuku) stood and gripped the book to his ($_izuku) chest Only to catch his ($_izuku) foot on the table s leg and promptly fall on his ($_izuku) face . Izuku ($_izuku) let out a pained hiss , rubbing his ($_izuku) sore nose . He ($_izuku) heard Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) quickly shuffling over to him ($_izuku) , saying something in her gentle tone , but his ($_izuku) attention was brought to the book splayed out in front of him ($_izuku) . 
The book had fallen out of his ($_izuku) grasp and opened to one of the final pages . He ($_izuku) hadn t yet gotten all the way through the book as he ($_izuku) studied it as he ($_izuku) had been both busy and too dismayed by his ($_izuku) lack of answers to it so the back was basically uncharted territory . 
Uncharted territory he ($_izuku) should have scouted . 
Because there , messily inscribed with rivers of ink running beneath them and almost nothing like the neat inscription by G on the first page , were four simple words that made his heart stop . 
They re coming for you .
