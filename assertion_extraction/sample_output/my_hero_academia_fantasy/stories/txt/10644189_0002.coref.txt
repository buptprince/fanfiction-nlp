It took Izuku ($_izuku) weeks to get used to the throng of humans who pressed their hands and faces to the glass , pointing and squealing . They weren t too bad , he supposed . He did a tumble in the water sometimes and the children would laugh and cheer . 
He released a breath into the water , the gills on the side of his neck flaring . There was another hand , now , tugging at tufts of midnight-green hair . He wanted to wrench away and swim to the bottom of the enclosure , but the last time he had done that - He bit his lip and scrunched his eyes shut . 
The grip on his hair loosened . The child had evidently lost interest . Izuku ($_izuku) breathed a sigh and sank into the water , and watched small bubbles swim up to the surface . Inhaling , he ($_izuku) surfaced and dove back into the water with a loud splash , amidst gasps of wonderment . He ($_izuku) swam to the deeper end , away from prying hands . 
Once , he ($_izuku) had pulled himself ($_izuku) up on deck to sun outside but he ($_izuku) realised that children were awfully mischievous . There was once a child tumbled in , and he ($_izuku) had heard the screams and shouts . He ($_izuku) caught the small thing and put her back on the deck . The humans had cheered and the attention made him ($_izuku) uncomfortable at first , but he ($_izuku) realised he ($_izuku) liked the way their eyes brightened and the children 's chubby hands waved in delight . 
Izuku ($_izuku) felt a sudden chill run down his ($_izuku) back and he ($_izuku) looked about the enclosure , realising that Todoroki Enji was watching him ($_izuku) from a corner of the room . He ($_izuku) bristled but he ($_izuku) didn t bare his ($_izuku) fangs . The_man ($_izuku) could do anything to punish him ($_izuku) , and Izuku ($_izuku) had long come to realise that it was best to just stay under the radar . He ($_izuku) turned away and swam into the cave at the bottom of the enclosure , finding comfort in the area decorated with the many trinkets Shouto ($_shouto) brought for him ($_izuku) . 
There was a figurine of a man who reminded Izuku of his ($_izuku) foster father . He ($_izuku) picked it up and sighed , wondering how his ($_izuku) friends and family were faring . He ($_izuku) just hoped that none of them had ventured too close to the surface in search of him ($_izuku) . 
There was a disturbance in the water and he ($_izuku) looked up , breaking into a smile as Shouto ($_shouto) entered the cave , struggling to hold onto a fish . 
Shouto ($_shouto) ! You re early . 
Yeah , I - Hey ! 
The fish wriggled out of the half-Mer s hands and swam away . Izuku ($_izuku) shot out of the cave , propelling himself ($_izuku) after his ($_izuku) prey . His ($_izuku) tail had healed completely and so had his ($_izuku) arms . It felt uncomfortable without his ($_izuku) fore arm fins but it was better than having lost a chunk of his ($_izuku) tail . He ($_izuku) caught the fish between his ($_izuku) sharp canines , relishing in the taste . It had been a while since his ($_izuku) last meal . 
Sorry I couldn t bring more . They ll throw some down soon , Shouto ($_shouto) laughed behind him ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) smiled sheepishly at his ($_izuku) friend , offering the remnants of fish to him ($_izuku) . 
You want some ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) raised his ($_shouto) hands , his ($_shouto) features contorting . Thanks but you know 
You don t eat fish raw ? Izuku ($_izuku) raised an eyebrow . 
Yeah , Shouto ($_shouto) breathed a laugh . Izuku ($_izuku) made a playful jab at him ($_izuku) with the fish and they chased each other around the enclosure , laughing all the while . It made Izuku ($_izuku) s heart swell , the way Shouto was laughing so unabashedly . Soon after the first time they had met , Shouto ($_shouto) had only offered stiff smiles . 
When they came to a stop , it was only because Shouto ($_shouto) had managed to pull Izuku ($_izuku) against him ($_shouto) , entwining their tails so that Izuku ($_izuku) couldn t get away . Izuku ($_izuku) felt his ($_izuku) ears heat up at the close proximity , but they stayed that way for a while , chests heaving . When Izuku ($_izuku) looked up at Shouto ($_shouto) , he ($_izuku) felt his ($_izuku) ears heat up at the intense gaze trained on him ($_izuku) . Shouto ($_shouto) looked thoughtful , almost . 
I found something , he ($_izuku) said . Izuku ($_izuku) looked at him ($_izuku) , tilting his ($_izuku) head . 
What is it ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) pulled away from him ($_izuku) slowly , offering him ($_izuku) a secret smile . I ll be back . 
Izuku ($_izuku) swam about , curiosity thrumming in him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) heard a distant splash and looked up to see Shouto swimming back down , and he ($_izuku) rose to meet him ($_izuku) halfway . 
Close your eyes , Shouto ($_shouto) commanded . 
Izuku ($_izuku) nodded , letting his ($_izuku) eyes flutter close . He ($_izuku) felt Shouto ($_shouto) loom closer , and a familiar weight settle on his ($_izuku) head soon after . 
You can open them now , he ($_izuku) felt a touch on his ($_izuku) hand . Izuku ($_izuku) looked at Shouto ($_shouto) in wonderment , one hand going up to trace the golden circlet , his ($_izuku) fingers running down the crown jewel encrusted in the middle , resting on his ($_izuku) forehead . It felt cool to the touch . 
I thought I d lost it , Izuku ($_izuku) pressed his ($_izuku) hands to his ($_izuku) cheeks , his ($_izuku) eyes burning . Thank you , Shouto ($_shouto) ! He ($_izuku) embraced the_bigger_Mer_on_impulse_,_the_choked_up_emotions ($_the) too much to express in words . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s arms slowly came to rest around his ($_shouto) waist , fingers lightly scraping on the spot where skin gave way to scales . 
When you told me about it , I knew it mattered a lot more than you let on . And I remembered seeing something like that in my father s room . 
Izuku ($_izuku) frowned . Won t you get in trouble ? 
Not if he ($_izuku) doesn t find out , Shouto ($_shouto) gave him ($_izuku) a conspiratorial smile . 
Izuku ($_izuku) burst into laughter , his ($_izuku) voice echoing like chimes to the ears of humans . You re right . 
Mama , look ! It s Deku s friend ! 
Shouto ($_shouto) turned in the direction of the sound , seeing a young child pressed up against the glass , her ($_shouto) eyes wide in excitement . Her ($_shouto) mother was standing next to her ($_shouto) , a soft smile on her ($_shouto) face . Shouto ($_shouto) pushed off and swam around Izuku ($_izuku) . The green-haired Mer kept him at bay his tail and sped off , towards the surface . Shouto ($_shouto) gave the child a small wave and chased after the other Mer , his ($_shouto) heart stuttering as it often did lately . 
When he ($_shouto) surfaced , he ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head to get rid of the water droplets running down thin strands of hair . He ($_shouto) saw Izuku ($_izuku) pull himself ($_shouto) onto the deck , where some of the staff had made plans to construct a railing to keep small visitors from grabbing at the_Mer ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) kept a distance between the visitors and himself ($_izuku) , ready to jump back into the water at any moment . 
Shouto ($_shouto) joined his ($_shouto) fellow Mer on deck . As his ($_shouto) tail dried , it almost seemed like the water was taking the scales with it , leaving a pair of legs in its wake . 
I m done with my internship so I ll be working here from tomorrow , he told Izuku ($_izuku) . 
Inter ... ship ? Izuku ($_izuku) looked at him ($_shouto) . 
Shouto ($_shouto) rubbed the back of his ($_shouto) head , trying to find the words to explain . It s where I go to train ? To learn how to take care of animals . 
But why? Izuku ($_izuku) looked puzzled . Are you ($_izuku) not good with them ? Why train ? 
Well , to learn to take care of them when they re sick and things like that . I m going to work here from now on . 
So you ($_izuku) can , Izuku ($_izuku) looked down , his ($_izuku) ear fins flaring a little . Come more often? 
Shouto ($_shouto) was overwhelmed by the urge to pull the_Mer ($_the) into an embrace . An urge which he ($_izuku) smothered and tossed into the Abyss of his ($_izuku) mind . Bad , Todoroki . Bad. 
I can , he ($_izuku) nodded . And , well , he ($_izuku) leaned closer to the Mer . I m going to find a way to help you ($_izuku) escape . 
Izuku ($_izuku) stared at him ($_izuku) in stunned silence . When he ($_izuku) finally spoke , it came out as a whisper . To any other human , it would ve sounded like a series of soft whistles . 
Really? 
Shouto ($_shouto) nodded . Really. 
Izuku ($_izuku) pressed his ($_izuku) fingers to his ($_izuku) reddening eyes . 
***
Escape was a fantastic idea . It really was , but it struck Izuku ($_izuku) a tad too late that he ($_izuku) had to overcome another problem . He ($_izuku) could feel it thrumming through his ($_izuku) veins , the need that he ($_izuku) had overcome by traversing the ocean currents back home . It was that time of the year . 
He ($_izuku) sat in his ($_izuku) cave , eyeing the the circlet that proved his ($_izuku) right to the throne . Next to it sat coral-pink pearls he ($_izuku) had strung together . Many a time , he ($_izuku) had abandoned the task , but he ($_izuku) couldn t help but complete it . He ($_izuku) rested his ($_izuku) cheek on his ($_izuku) palm , wondering what to do . 
What would Toshinori tell him ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) wondered ? Or his ($_izuku) mother ? 
Fear not , my boy ! Go for what your heart desires ! He ($_izuku) could hear the King s voice . He ($_izuku) bit his ($_izuku) lip . As for his ($_izuku) mother , she had pressed a kiss to his ($_izuku) forehead and asked him ($_izuku) to find a mate worthy of his ($_izuku) `` big heart '' . 
He ($_izuku) slowly pushed out of the cave , wondering when Shouto ($_shouto) would return . It was getting dark and the humans were leaving in a steady trickle . He ($_izuku) pressed up to the glass , gaze flicking left and right . Izuku ($_izuku) pushed away from the barrier and made his ($_izuku) way back to the cave with lazy flicks of his ($_izuku) strong tail . 
He ($_izuku) would rest a while , before Shouto ($_shouto) arrived ... 
***
Todoroki_Enji ($_todoroki) read the reports , understanding slowly dawning upon him ($_izuku) . He ($_todoroki) took a look at the computer screen , observing how the_Royal_Mer ($_the) was swimming about listlessly . 
He ($_todoroki) took another glance at the report . Not eating enough , antsy behaviour , hoarding a whole bunch of shells that had been scattered at the bottom for decorations - 
Telltale signs . He ($_todoroki) grimaced . He ($_todoroki) knew just how much time his ($_todoroki) son spent with the_Mer ($_the) , and uneducated as the boy was , he ($_todoroki) insisted he ($_todoroki) knew better . With a grunt , Enji picked up the phone . 
`` It 's me . Call the new recruits . We 're putting the Royal with the other one . ''
