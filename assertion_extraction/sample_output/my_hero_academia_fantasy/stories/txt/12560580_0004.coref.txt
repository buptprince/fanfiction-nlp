IV 
The town square was bustling with movement and noise . As far as the eye could see , Katsuki ($_katsuki) and Tenya_'s ($_tenya) vision was filled with a vast array of people all shapes and sizes . The people wore so many different colors , most_Katsuki ($_most) did n't even think existed . 
Turning to his ($_most) left he ($_most) saw several people scattered near a lone tree , all conversing or sticking to their own devices . There were two men , oddly similar in appearance , talking near the tree . There was a large woman playing with a small , furry , four-legged animal ; it jumped around a lot and made weird , ear-grating yips whenever it opened its mouth . Farther beyond the tree was a narrow alleyway with what looked like houses upon houses stacked on top of and next to each other . A few people made their way in and out of the passage way , but Katsuki ($_katsuki) saw nothing worth exploring . 
`` That price is ridiculous ! '' 
`` It 's your loss , hag ! I 'll take it ! '' 
A loud commotion sounded to his and Tenya_'s ($_tenya) right ; turning , they saw an enormous crowd of people who easily towered over them gathered around what looked like and open market area . Through the giant figures blocking their sight , they were able to pick out a large table , covered in all sorts of goods and items . With the vast lot of people crowding the small area , it seemed that they easily took up a fourth of the space in the town square . 
"Hey! I saw that first ! '' 
`` Well , I touched it first ! '' 
The noise skyrocketed and Katsuki ($_katsuki) felt that it would be best to get as far away from the ever-increasing sea of angry people as quickly as possible . 
Backing away , he ($_katsuki) turned and saw another market area , and the crowd surrounding it could have rivaled the other by a significant margin . The squabbles he ($_katsuki) heard from there also deterred him ($_katsuki) from going near them . The building behind them had a single door with a large staircase and a weird object painted on the wall . There was a large sign above the door that read : Bombchu Bowling Alley . Looking from the sign to the painting on the wall , Katsuki ($_katsuki) was able to answer his ($_katsuki) own questions . 
`` But I still do n't get it , '' he ($_katsuki) mused aloud . 
Tenya ($_tenya) furrowed his ($_tenya) brow , `` What do n't you ($_tenya) get ? '' 
Turning to face the fairy , the boy frowned , `` What the hell 's a bow-ling alley ? '' 
`` Ah , '' the fair looked back at the building . `` I. . . I really do n't know . '' 
Shaking his ($_tenya) head , he ($_tenya) sighed and turned away from his ($_tenya) smaller companion , `` It does n't matter right now . I need to find out which way it is to the castle ... '' 
Finger on his ($_tenya) lips , the_boy ($_iida) simply looked around to try and see all the possible areas . It was so hard to from where he ($_tenya) was . There were so many people moving past him ($_tenya) , and they all towered over him ($_tenya) , he ($_tenya) swore was going to be crushed . 
There was another alleyway next to the Bombchu building , and then just more buildings the followed . As he ($_tenya) made a full circle , he ($_tenya) saw a shooting gallery , a bunch of people , another alleyway albeit much wider than the others he ($_tenya) had seen ; a `` Happy Mask '' shop , a whole bunch more people , a `` potion '' shop , more people , another shop called `` Cementoss . '' In the center of the town square there was a large fountain of water . Even in the low light , the clear water sparkled so brightly . 
Oh , did Katsuki ($_katsuki) forget to mention ... there were a lot of people ! 
It was a never-ending swarm of giants that went here and there , going about their daily lives not knowing how drastically their mere existence was changing a single boy 's entire world view . 
Cautiously taking steps towards the fountain , trying to stay out of all the other people 's ways , he ($_tenya) mumbled , `` And here I thought that All Might guy was the only giant here . '' 
Fluttering by his ($_tenya) ear , Tenya ($_tenya) sighed , `` You ($_tenya) know that none of these people even come close to rivaling the size of that man , right ? '' 
`` I ($_tenya) know but still ! '' 
Quirking a brow , the fairy frowned at him ($_tenya) , `` Katsuki ($_katsuki) ... '' 
Narrowly dodging away from a man that ran past , Katsuki ($_katsuki) bit out a quick , `` What ? '' 
`` Are you ($_tenya) intimidated ? '' 
"What? No ! '' The_boy ($_iida) whipped his ($_iida) head around so fast , his ($_iida) hair shifted to the other side of his ($_iida) face . `` I ($_iida) do n't even know what that word means but the answer is no ! '' 
`` Intimidated ; it means to feel threatened or scared by someone or something , '' hands clasped together , the fairy held them to his face as he sighed . `` Gods above , what even was your formal education ? '' 
Balling ($_balling) his ($_balling) hands into fists , the boy spat , `` Hey , do n't talk about me ($_balling) when I ($_balling) 'm right here ! '' 
`` Do n't you have a castle you need to be finding ? '' 
Face scrunched up in displeasure , Katsuki ($_katsuki) simply stuck out his ($_katsuki) tongue at the fairy . Tenya_in_turn ($_in) only rolled his ($_in) eyes . 
"Very mature." 
Shoving his ($_in) fists to his ($_in) sides , the_boy ($_iida) went back to trying to stay out of people 's way . It was like they ($_iida) were all trapped in their ($_iida) own little word , paying no mind to the boy they ($_iida) 'd most likely shove out of the way if he ($_in) never moved . They ($_iida) were never-ending , after every person that went past him ($_in) , another was sure to follow . Back and forth , back and forth ; it felt like what little_space_Katsuki ($_katsuki) had was quickly closing in on him ($_in) and all he ($_in) could do was back away , nearly tripping over his ($_in) feet every step of the way . 
Step by step , he ($_in) walked away from the stream of people , failing to see where he ($_in) was heading . The hard stone against the back of his ($_in) legs was his ($_in) only warning before he ($_in) felt his ($_in) body fall backwards into the cold water behind him ($_in) . 
His ($_in) body only made a small wave rise from the fountain , and while the splash of water was like a crack to him ($_in) , it was only an adage to the drowning noise already produced by the town . 
Placing his ($_in) hands firmly against the cold stone below the water , they boy pulled his ($_in) head up from the surface as he ($_in) coughed the liquid from his ($_in) mouth . Eyes squeezed tight , his ($_in) shook the water from his ($_in) face as he ($_in) tried to feel for the edge of the fountain . 
Tenya , who could only watch the scene below him ($_in) with amusement , smiled , `` You ($_in) seem to have a knack for falling into pools of water , do n't you ($_in) Katsuki ($_katsuki) ? '' 
Eyes still shut tight , he ($_in) growled , `` Shut up or I ($_in) 'll drag you down here with me ($_in) ! '' 
`` Try doing that after you 've wiped the water from your eyes , haha ! '' 
`` Hey , are ya okay ? '' 
A boy 's voice called out to him and in turn Katsuki turned his head towards the sound , eyes barely blinking open . 
`` That water must be really cold . '' The voice sounded closer , and it sounded entertained . `` Here , let 's get ya out of there . '' 
Suddenly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) saw hands reach out to him ($_katsuki) and grab his ($_katsuki) wrists ; they were the same size as his ($_katsuki) own . 
Is there actually someone my size here in this town ? 
`` Come this way , '' the voice , which definitely sounded young , laughed . `` I promise it 's dry . '' 
Standing up from the fountain , lamenting the way his ($_katsuki) clothes began to stick to his ($_katsuki) body again , he ($_katsuki) followed the way the hands clasped to his ($_katsuki) wrists pulled as his ($_katsuki) vision began to clear . The saw the edge of the fountain and made sure to jump over it , lest he ($_katsuki) wanted to fall flat on his ($_katsuki) face in front of a stranger . 
Once his ($_katsuki) feet were placed firmly the ground , the hands latched onto him ($_katsuki) quickly pulled away and now with his ($_katsuki) hands free , Katsuki ($_katsuki) quickly wiped away whatever water remained clouding his ($_katsuki) vision . 
`` I ($_katsuki) saw ya fall in the fountain , but then ya did n't get out and I ($_katsuki) thought ya might have hurt yourself . '' 
Mouth turning into a frown , he ($_katsuki) pouted , `` I ($_katsuki) did n't get hurt ... '' 
`` Ah , '' there was a soft clapping noise like two hands smacking together . `` I ($_katsuki) 'm glad to hear that . '' 
Looking up at the person who pulled him ($_katsuki) from the fountain , Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) eyes widened when he ($_katsuki) found himself ($_katsuki) looking ... at himself ($_katsuki) ? 
His ($_katsuki) doppelganger 's eyes also widened when he ($_katsuki) saw the face of the boy he ($_katsuki) just helped . 
`` Wha , hey ! '' The sound left their mouths at the same time . 
Stunned , they both slapped their hands over their mouths in shock as all they could do was look at each other . 
Practically everything about one another was the same ; eyes , hair , face , size , stature . Their only differences were in dress and voice . Perhaps even in overall demeanor they were different . Katsuki ($_katsuki) took one glance at him ($_katsuki) , and while the other boy was without a doubt a lookalike , he ($_katsuki) was obviously much more approachable than he ($_katsuki) was . 
The other boy then let a smile stretch past his shielding hands and a handsome laugh bubbled from his lips . 
`` Haha , '' he dropped his hands . `` Ya look just like me ! '' 
Eyes wide , body stiff , Katsuki ($_katsuki) shook his ($_katsuki) head , `` No , you look just like me ($_katsuki) ! '' 
`` You both look like each other . '' The_boy ($_iida) heard Tenya ($_tenya) mumble from his ($_tenya) side . 
`` Woah , is that a fairy ? '' 
Eyes wide , Katsuki ($_katsuki) and Tenya ($_tenya) both stared at the other boy in shock . 
`` Wait , '' pointing to his ($_tenya) small companion , the_boy ($_iida) asked , `` You can see him ($_tenya) ? '' 
Hands dropping to his ($_tenya) sides entirely , the_boy_'s ($_iida) face slacked with surprise , `` Is it weird if I ($_tenya) did n't see a really tiny person with wings buzzing by your ($_tenya) head ? '' 
"But how?" 
`` Um ... I ($_tenya) believe in fairies ... '' 
Resting his ($_tenya) hands on his ($_tenya) hips , Katsuki ($_katsuki) pursed his ($_tenya) lips , `` I ($_tenya) guess that makes sense . '' 
`` Say , since ya have a fairy , '' the lookalike leaned closer to the two . `` that must mean you 're from the forest , are n't ya ? '' 
Leaning back , Katsuki ($_katsuki) only nodded his ($_katsuki) head . 
Smiling , the lookalike said , `` I figured , plus I 'm pretty sure that symbol on your shield is that of the forest ; that 's what my ma 's always told me at least . '' 
`` Your ma ... '' 
`` Yup ! '' 
Brows furrowed , Katsuki ($_katsuki) tapped a knuckle against his ($_katsuki) head , and then looked up at the lookalike . 
`` What 's a ma ? '' 
`` Eh ... what ? '' 
`` A ma , '' he ($_katsuki) repeated , nose scrunched in confusion . `` Never heard of one ; what is it ? '' 
The lookalike let his ($_katsuki) mouth fall open in shock , head tilted like his ($_katsuki) brain stopped for just a few seconds . 
`` Wait , '' he ($_katsuki) pointed a finger at him ($_katsuki) , `` are ya ($_katsuki) bein ' serious ? '' 
"Yeah?" 
Bracing his ($_katsuki) hands on his ($_katsuki) head , the lookalike shook it in disbelief , `` Well , I ($_katsuki) ca n't ... I ($_katsuki) mean ... a ma he ($_katsuki) or she 's like the person who birthed ya ($_katsuki) ... takes care of ya ($_katsuki) ... ? '' 
Moving his ($_katsuki) hands about , he ($_katsuki) rattled on , `` And they 're not all known as Ma , either ; there 's Mom , Mother , Mama , Mommy all sorts of variations ! I just grew up with callin ' mine ` Ma ' so ... '' 
Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) face only held mild shock and confusion , `` Birthed ... what ... '' 
`` Ah , though , I ($_katsuki) suppose people from the forest are n't actually born ; they 're just there ... '' 
Shaking his ($_katsuki) head , the lookalike just smiled , `` I ($_katsuki) 'm getting off topic ; I ($_katsuki) suppose I ($_katsuki) should introduce myself ($_katsuki) since we 've been talkin ' an ' all ... '' 
Contemplating it for a brief moment , he ($_katsuki) nodded his ($_katsuki) head , `` Okay . '' 
`` Why does n't your fairy friend start ? '' The_boy ($_iida) asked . `` I ($_iida) feel like we ($_iida) 've been ignoring him ($_katsuki) . '' 
`` Ah , no , that 's quite alright , '' Tenya ($_tenya) chimed in , flying close to the_boy_'s ($_iida) face with a happy smile . `` My ($_iida) name is Tenya_Iida ($_tenya) ; and , if you have n't already noticed , I ($_iida) am a blue fairy . The fastest and rarest of the faries . '' 
`` Ah , '' the_boy_'s ($_iida) eyes widened in excitement . "Really? That 's so cool ! '' 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked over at his ($_katsuki) companion , `` Why 'd you ($_katsuki) never tell me ($_katsuki) that , Iida ? '' 
`` You ($_katsuki) had n't asked . '' 
Placing his ($_katsuki) hand outstretched , the lookalike 's grin never left , `` My_name_'s_Katsuki ($_katsuki) My ($_katsuki) name 's Katsuki '' 
`` No way ; that 's my ($_katsuki) name ! '' 
Pausing , the_boy_'s ($_iida) hand dropped , `` You ($_iida) 've got ta be kiddin ' '' 
Shaking his ($_iida) head firmly , he ($_iida) glared at his ($_iida) lookalike once more , hands balled into fists , `` My ($_iida) name 's Katsuki ($_katsuki) ; always been Katsuki ! '' 
`` Wha ... '' The other boy started back . `` Well mine 's always been Katsuki ($_katsuki) , too ! So , I guess our names must be more common than we thought , huh ? '' 
Lowing his ($_iida) fists , Katsuki ($_katsuki) simply looked back at him ($_iida) with a frown , `` I ($_iida) guess ... I ($_iida) would n't know but I ($_iida) 'm still going by my ($_iida) name , so you ($_iida) got ta let me ($_iida) call you ($_iida) something else ! '' 
`` Okay , okay , '' the_boy ($_iida) said placidly , hands raised in front of him ($_iida) , `` Well , I ($_iida) mean ya can just use my ($_iida) last name . It 's Gougou ($_gougou) . '' 
`` Katsuki Gougou ? '' 
Scratching the back of his ($_iida) head , the lookalike , Gougou ($_gougou) , chuckled , `` Yeah , I ($_iida) guess my ($_iida) name does sound a little weird . Although , around here , we switch the names around when we say 'em ... more respectful I ($_iida) guess ? Why do n't ya tell me ($_iida) yours ? '' 
Mouth falling open only a fraction , Katsuki narrowed his eyes , '' Katsuki ($_katsuki) ... '' 
`` Haha , no your last name ; the one before your first name . '' # . " I. . . I do n't have one ... '' 
`` What are ya , a bastard ? '' 
He does n't know why , but he feels his cheeks flush red when he processed what Gougou ($_gougou) said . 
"What?" 
`` Ah , wait , I forgot , '' Gougou ($_gougou) started again , hands waving . `` You came from the forest , so that does n't apply to ya at all . Just forget what I said . '' 
Cheeks still flushed , Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked away , `` Tch , whatever ... '' 
`` Wait a minute , '' eyes widening , he ($_katsuki) looked back at his ($_katsuki) lookalike , `` You said Gougou ... did you mean Gougou ($_gougou) as in '' 
`` As in Gougou Ranch from outside the town , '' he ($_katsuki) cut in , finishing Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) thought . `` Yeah , that 's my ma 's ranch . It 's where I live , too . We specialize the raising of the Gougou cows , coocoos , and horses . We happen to be most liked because of our special Gougou milk . '' 
Brows furrowed , he ($_katsuki) looked up , `` Gougou milk ... ? '' 
`` Yup , the best on the market , '' the_boy ($_iida) grinned . `` Sweet enough ya never tire of it ; enough calcium to make your bones grow big and strong ! Ya should come by the ranch tonight so I can give ya a taste . It 'll be free of charge , I swear . '' 
"Oh, yeah, sure..."
Looking up at the sky , Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) eyes widened when he ($_katsuki) saw the rich velvet colors of the sunset becoming darker and darker . The_giant_man_from_the_field_,_All_Might_;_his_words ($_katsuki) his ($_katsuki) words rang in his ($_katsuki) head like a scream . Oh , wait , it was . 
It is very important that you meet him ($_katsuki) by tomorrow morning ... you can not delay ! 
`` I ca n't go , '' he ($_katsuki) yelled at Gougou ($_gougou) suddenly , catching the_boy ($_iida) off guard . `` I have to go to the castle right now ! '' 
`` Okay , okay ... the castle ? '' Gougou ($_gougou) mused , lip jutting out . `` My ($_gougou) ma 's up there right now delivering some milk and stock ... she ($_gougou) has n't come back yet . Is that what you 've been looking around town for ? The way to Yuuei Castle ? '' 
"Yes!" 
Suddenly laughing , Gougou ($_gougou) pointed to his ($_gougou) left , at the pathway between the shooting gallery and the Happy Mask Shop , `` I ($_gougou) do n't know what your business is at the castle , but just go straight down that path and eventually you 'll run into a lone tree . To your right will be the castle gate and a guard . '' 
Nodding his ($_gougou) head , he ($_gougou) bit out a quick thanks and then ran off in between the traffic of people and down the pathway . Gougou ($_gougou) tried to call him ($_gougou) back , but the_boy ($_iida) was out of sight within a matter of seconds . 
Sighing , Gougou ($_gougou) shoved his ($_gougou) hands into the back pockets of his ($_gougou) pants . Looking up at the slowly darkening sky , he ($_gougou) flattened his ($_gougou) lips . 
`` I ($_gougou) hope he ($_gougou) knows that ya ($_gougou) can bribe the gate guard for only 50 wen . '' 
. oO0Oo . 
When Katsuki ($_katsuki) finally saw the lone tree that Gougou ($_gougou) had mentioned , he ($_katsuki) slowed down and placed his ($_katsuki) hands on his ($_katsuki) knees as he ($_katsuki) tried to catch his ($_katsuki) breath . Sweat was dripping from his ($_katsuki) brow , he ($_katsuki) 'd been running for over 30 minutes and he ($_katsuki) was still . Wet . And. Cold . 
`` I hate how big everything is , '' he ($_katsuki) growled to Tenya as he ($_katsuki) slowly straightened up , stretching his ($_katsuki) back with his ($_katsuki) arms raised above his ($_katsuki) head . 
`` Why ca n't everything be the same small size like Yousei Village ? '' 
`` I ($_katsuki) 'm not sure , Katsuki ($_katsuki) . '' 
`` Ugh , so annoying ... '' 
Patting his ($_katsuki) hands against his ($_katsuki) shirt , the_boy ($_iida) began walking towards the tree , and as he ($_katsuki) got closer , he ($_katsuki) could see where the corner of the pathway began . Looking up at the sky , he ($_katsuki) was thankful that he ($_katsuki) was still making good time ; there was still the nice scarlet light of the nearing twilight . All he ($_katsuki) had to do was get onto the castle grounds and find the_prince ($_the) and it was all going to be great '' 
`` DO NOT FEAR ! '' 
And suddenly the light was blocked by a giant dark shadow . 
`` Hah , what the hell ? '' 
`` FOR I AM HERE ! '' 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) found himself ($_katsuki) planted right on his ($_katsuki) but as the ground shook from the impact of All Might landing right in front of him ($_katsuki) . Looking up , he ($_katsuki) grimaced at the sparking grin of the giant as he ($_katsuki) waved down at him ($_katsuki) . 
`` AH , KATSUKI ($_katsuki) , MY BOY ! '' He ($_katsuki) started , voice booming as expected . `` THE_PRINCE ($_the) IS INSIDE THE CASTLE JUST AHEAD . NOW YOUR TRUE TEST IS TO NOT GET CAUGHT BY THE GUARDS ! HA HA HA ! '' 
Glaring up at him ($_katsuki) , the_boy ($_iida) barked back , `` Thanks , that was really helpful ! '' 
Looking down , while his ($_katsuki) smile never faded , All_Might_'s ($_all) eyes softened ; he ($_katsuki) crouched down to be almost at eye level with him ($_katsuki) . Arms resting on his ($_katsuki) knees , he ($_katsuki) spoke again , this time significantly softer than prior . 
`` Now , now , my_boy ($_iida) , '' he ($_katsuki) started . `` I know I 'm just stating the obvious , but it 's just to reinforce what your objective is , lest you forget . I ca n't tell you how to do the tough things ; that 's your test , to try your wisdom and reasoning . '' 
Straightening back up , the giant looked down at the_boy ($_iida) with a warmer smile , `` You ($_iida) 're a smart boy , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ... I know you ($_iida) 'll figure out your ($_iida) way . GOOD LUCK ! '' 
And with that , the giant bent his ($_katsuki) legs and then took off from the ground . A sharp breeze kicked in , but luckily the_boy ($_iida) was already rooted to the ground , so he ($_katsuki) was never knocked from his ($_katsuki) feet . Following the black silhouette of All_Might_'s ($_all) quickly disappearing figure , he ($_katsuki) sighed as he ($_katsuki) stood up from the ground and began to walk towards the tree . 
As he ($_katsuki) got closer to the tree , he ($_katsuki) heard a telltale shuffling sound and promptly whipped out his ($_katsuki) slingshot . Aiming up to the branches , Katsuki ($_katsuki) shot to Midori seeds and with a shrill screech , a gold sukulltula fell from the leaves and shriveled into a familiar golden token . 
Reaching down , he ($_katsuki) picked up the token and shoved it in his ($_katsuki) satchel without a second thought . 
`` Is n't that like , '' Tenya ($_tenya) began . `` the fourth one you 've caught so far ? '' 
`` Yup . '' 
`` Do you ever plan to stop ? '' 
"Nope." 
Turning away from the tree , Katsuki ($_katsuki) began to walk around the corner , towards the gate of the castle grounds when he ($_katsuki) heard a familiar voice . 
`` Hey , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ! '' 
Whipping his ($_katsuki) head around , he ($_katsuki) looked behind him ($_katsuki) and saw Gougou ($_gougou) running towards him ($_katsuki) , an arm outstretched as he ($_katsuki) called out to him ($_katsuki) . 
`` I ($_katsuki) need to ask ya somethin' ! '' 
Turning around completely , he ($_katsuki) quickly dashed over and met the_boy ($_iida) halfway , curiosity written on his ($_katsuki) face . 
`` What is it ? '' 
Skidding to a halt , Gougou ($_gougou) sucked in a few breaths of air , `` I was ... wonderin ' I mean ... ya have n't gotten into the castle , have ya ? '' 
`` Nah , '' he ($_katsuki) shook his ($_katsuki) head . 
`` Oh , good ... '' A weary smile graced his ($_katsuki) lips . 
`` When ya get inside , could ya look for my ma ? '' 
Tilting his ($_katsuki) head in surprise , he ($_katsuki) responded , `` Hah ? '' 
Clasping his ($_katsuki) hands together , Gougou ($_gougou) shook them slowly , `` I ($_katsuki) know it 's an odd thing to ask , we just met an ' all , but my ($_katsuki) ma 's been at the castle since mid-afternoon an ' she has n't come back yet . She 's always tired an ' takes naps at the oddest times ... '' 
`` I could use a nap right now ... '' 
It came out mumbled , so the_boy ($_iida) never heard and continued on . 
`` She probably fell asleep around the castle ; would ya mind looking for her for me ? '' 
Jutting out his lips , Katsuki ($_katsuki) rocked his head back and forth before giving his answer , `` I guess so ... I 'll try and find her . '' 
`` Really , '' the_boy_'s ($_iida) eyes practically sparkled and Katsuki ($_katsuki) was a little unnerved that a face so similar to his ($_katsuki) own could make such a natural expression . `` Thank ya so much ; here , you 'll need this . '' 
Reaching down into his ($_katsuki) pant pocket , Gougou ($_gougou) pulled out a large , white egg and handed it to him ($_katsuki) with a soft smile . 
`` The only thing that wakes her up these days is the cry of a coocoo , '' he ($_katsuki) said with a weak laugh . `` This little guy 's gon na hatch within the night , I ($_katsuki) know it . Just make sure ya have him out when the morning comes . '' 
`` Ah , '' tentatively , Katsuki ($_katsuki) took the egg from his ($_katsuki) hands and carefully placed it in his ($_katsuki) satchel . `` Alright , but now what are you going to do ? '' 
`` Oh , '' eyes wide , the_boy ($_iida) shoved his ($_iida) hands in his ($_iida) pockets . `` Well , there 's only a few minutes till nightfall ; I have to get back to the ranch . Got ($_got) ta make sure all the animals are in their stables an ' all , ya know ? It ($_got) 's why I ran after ya ; I could n't wait for my ma all night . '' 
He nodded his head in understanding , `` Yeah , I get it ... '' 
Gougou_'s ($_gougou) smile morphed into a grin , `` Thank ya so much , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ! I know we just met an ' all but you 're amazing ! See ya ! '' 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) simply waved as he ($_katsuki) saw his ($_katsuki) lookalike turn around and run back towards the town . Within a matter of seconds , the_boy ($_iida) was out of sight . Looking up at the sky , he ($_katsuki) took notice of the time ; the twilight had long since passed and now the sky was colored a hazy purplish-blue , stars began to glitter the night and from his ($_katsuki) left , he ($_katsuki) saw the ivory glow of the moon as it rose above . 
Turning around , he ($_katsuki) noticed a large swath of vine crawling up the wall . With curiosity pooled in his ($_katsuki) heart , he ($_katsuki) went over to it and quickly began to haul himself ($_katsuki) up the tangle of plants . 
Tenya ($_tenya) fluttered around his ($_tenya) head as he ($_tenya) climbed , `` You know , that was a nice thing you said you 'd do . '' 
Grunting as he ($_tenya) forced his ($_tenya) muscles to exertion , he ($_tenya) bit out , `` You think so ? '' 
`` Well , of course , '' the fairy spread his ($_tenya) arms . `` Gougou ($_gougou) said it himself ($_gougou) , you two had just met and you said you were willing to take the time from our mission to look for his ($_gougou) mother . '' 
Clutching at the top of the wall , Katsuki ($_katsuki) pulled himself ($_katsuki) over the edge and rolled onto his ($_katsuki) side . 
`` I do n't think it 's that big of a deal , '' he ($_katsuki) said as he ($_katsuki) picked himself ($_katsuki) from the grassy hilltop he ($_katsuki) now stood on . `` I mean , my mission involves me breaking into a castle , apparently ; there 's got ta be some law being broken here ... might as well do some good ... '' 
`` I suppose you do have a point . '' 
Walking across the hill , Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked to his ($_katsuki) left and saw the top of the castle gate , a large , looming bird-reptile creature sculpted at the top of the enormous structure of stone . Looking across the top of the gate , he ($_katsuki) saw a guard , and as he ($_katsuki) peered over the new edge of the hill , he ($_katsuki) saw the gate guard from the other side . 
Looking down at the ground below , Katsuki ($_katsuki) reasoned that the_fall ($_the) would n't be that far . He ($_katsuki) 'd fallen from higher much higher and survived with barely a scratch . Granted those instances had his ($_katsuki) fall broken by water , but still , he ($_katsuki) found his ($_katsuki) reasoning valid . He ($_katsuki) was hesitating for no reason . 
Get going , you idiot ! 
Shaking his ($_katsuki) head , he ($_katsuki) straightened up and walked to the edge of the hill . Bending his ($_katsuki) knees , he ($_katsuki) prepared for the_fall ($_the) . 
Jumping off the hill , he ($_katsuki) clenched his ($_katsuki) teeth as he ($_katsuki) landed in the ground with flat feet . Straightening up once more , he ($_katsuki) looked behind him ($_katsuki) and saw that the guard in front of the gate had n't moved and he ($_katsuki) figured that they did n't know where he ($_katsuki) was . Shaking his ($_katsuki) head , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ran down the dirt path till he ($_katsuki) got to another corner . 
Once he ($_katsuki) neared the turn , he ($_katsuki) pressed himself ($_katsuki) flat against one of the sides of the pathway . There were guards up ahead ; he ($_katsuki) needed to avoid them . With soft clanking above him ($_katsuki) , he ($_katsuki) knew that there must have been a guard or two above him ($_katsuki) as well . Shifting cautiously against the wall , he ($_katsuki) rose on his ($_katsuki) tip toes when he ($_katsuki) got to a lower part of the wall to try and see where he ($_katsuki) could go . 
The guards along the pathway were at a good distance that they would n't see him ($_katsuki) if he ($_katsuki) got just a little bit closer . The guard above him ($_katsuki) was facing away from him ($_katsuki) . If he ($_katsuki) walked just a few steps farther , he ($_katsuki) could definitely climb up the side of the wall and sneak behind him ($_katsuki) . 
Looking around , Katsuki ($_katsuki) saw a thin slope just a few steps in front of him ($_katsuki) . The guards on the pathway would n't notice him ($_katsuki) , and the guard above would n't see him ($_katsuki) either . It was absolutely perfect . He ($_katsuki) went for the slope . 
Quietly scrabbling up the wall , he ($_katsuki) dashed across the large expanse of grass , brushes , and trees that made up the castle grounds . The guards were all spaced sporadically here and there , all much too far away from the direction Katsuki ($_katsuki) was running for them to actually notice him ($_katsuki) . The sky had gone completely shadowed by that time , the bright , pale moon shining down as the only source of light . Soon he ($_katsuki) found himself ($_katsuki) on the other side of the castle grounds , near another wall of earth and stone . 
Luckily this wall had a huge expanse of thick vines for him ($_katsuki) to climb . 
With a smile , he ($_katsuki) proceeded to haul himself ($_katsuki) over the new wall and then prompt hopped over the top to get to the other side . 
Landing on his ($_katsuki) feet , he ($_katsuki) started to move forward but then stopped after he ($_katsuki) noticed the large steam of flowing water obstructing his ($_katsuki) path . Looking to his ($_katsuki) right , he ($_katsuki) saw that there was a pair of guards standing behind an open gate , by they were too far away to see him ($_katsuki) from where he ($_katsuki) was standing . However , he ($_katsuki) also saw that the only way to sneak past them was to swim behind them in the moat . 
Looking down , he ($_katsuki) began to pout , then he ($_katsuki) whipped his ($_katsuki) head around to look at Tenya ($_tenya) . 
`` Ii-da ! '' It was a hissed whine . 
`` What other choice do you have ? '' 
Facing down at the flowing stream below , he ($_katsuki) glared at the infernal liquid with a kindling hatred , `` I ($_katsuki) was just getting dry , too . '' 
`` I ($_katsuki) feel for you , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , I ($_katsuki) do , '' the fairy said . `` You just seem to be a water magnet , I suppose . '' 
`` Ugh ... '' 
With great reluctance , the_boy ($_iida) quietly fell into the water , body quaking as he ($_iida) had to slowly ease himself ($_iida) into the night-chilled water . Shuddering from the cold , his ($_iida) teeth began to chatter and his ($_iida) nose began to burn . 
Shaking his ($_iida) head , Katsuki ($_katsuki) started to swim down the moat , heading straight for the other side and to the corner . As he ($_iida) got closer , he ($_iida) saw that the corner of the moat got a little shallow , making it easier for the boy to pull himself ($_iida) from the stream when he ($_iida) needed to . With that knowledge , he ($_iida) pushed himself ($_iida) forward despite the exhaustion in his ($_iida) limbs screaming at him ($_iida) to stop . Within a matter of seconds , he ($_iida) was at the corner of the moat . 
Pulling himself ($_iida) up from the water , Katsuki ($_katsuki) shuddered and then quickly ran down the side of the castle , away from the guards standing merely a few feet away . 
As he ($_iida) got near the end of the passageway , Katsuki ($_katsuki) saw the moat od water continued . On the side of the wall , he ($_iida) noticed a small hole , big enough for him ($_iida) to squeeze through , with water softly trickling into the stream below . However , before he ($_iida) could even begin figuring out a way to get across , he ($_iida) also took notice of the figure curled up on the ground , behind her lied a few large crates . 
As he ($_iida) drew closer , he ($_iida) could make out in the blue light of the_night ($_the) that it was a woman . 
This must be Gougou_'s ($_gougou) ma , he thought . 
Her spiky , long hair was covering her face , but he could tell that she was sleeping . Trying to be mindful , he lightly kicked one of her legs . She did n't even budge . 
The only thing that wakes her up these days is the cry of a coocoo . 
Eyes heavy , he sighed as he realized that he 'd have to wait until the coocoo egg hatched . Opening his satchel , he reached in and pulled out the coocoo egg and then walked over to one of the crates . Sitting down , he placed the egg in his lap and looked up at the moon as he felt his eyes growing heavier and heavier . 
Why do I have to ... do all these things ... ? 
Closing his eyes , Katsuki ($_katsuki) lied back against the crate and wished the_night ($_the) would last as long as possible . 
. oO0Oo . 
CAAAH-AAH-AAAH-AAH-AAAH ! 
The clamorous shriek sounding from his lap , startled the_boy ($_iida) from his slumber ; eyes wide , he cried out as he sat up from the crate he was leaning against and looked down . 
The egg that used to be in his lap was completely shattered and in its stead , was a small , but very loud coocoo hatchling . Its head bobbed up and down as it hopped in place . 
`` Wha ... what in tarnation ? '' 
Eyes wide , he saw Gougou_'s ($_gougou) ma pick herself ($_gougou) up from the ground . Flailing , he placed the newborn hatchling on the ground and scrambled to his feet . 
The_woman_'s ($_gougou) bleary eyes blinked rapidly as she ($_gougou) tried to wake up ; the dawn 's light shining on her ($_gougou) face making her ($_gougou) grimace . Staggering to her ($_gougou) feet , she ($_gougou) was able to make out the all too familiar figure of a boy she ($_gougou) knew . Even if everything was blurry with her ($_gougou) sleep-heavy eyes . 
`` Katsuki ... baby , what are you doing here ? '' 
She ($_gougou) watched as the_boy ($_iida) only shook his ($_iida) head and speak , `` I ($_iida) 'm not your kid ; I ($_iida) swear , I ($_iida) just look like him ($_iida) . '' 
That was such an odd thing to say . Tilting her ($_gougou) head , she ($_gougou) wondered what kind of prank her ($_gougou) son was playing . Then again , with her ($_gougou) vision and memory clearing up , some things were becoming more evident . Why did her ($_gougou) son sound so different ; why was he dressed like ... 
"Hey! What's going on over there?" 
A firm , authoritative voice sounded from around the castle wall . It was the castle guards ; they must 've heard the little coocoo hatchling that was currently hobbling on the ground 
Wait... why was there ???
`` Your son gave me the bird to wake you up , '' she ($_gougou) heard the_boy ($_iida) hiss at her ($_gougou) . `` Do n't let those guards know I ($_gougou) 'm here , please ! '' 
Quickly , the_boy ($_iida) rounded behind the crate he ($_iida) had been standing in front of and hid behind it . The_woman ($_gougou) only blinked with bewilderment from the whole situation . 
"Halt! You ah ... Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) ? What are you still doing here ? '' 
Turning his head slightly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) watched from afar as he saw the scene unfold before him . 
`` Oh , I , um ... '' Gougou_'s ($_gougou) ma , Mitsuki , stumbled with her ($_gougou) words . Looking around , she ($_gougou) looked back at the guards standing in front of her ($_gougou) . `` I ($_gougou) do n't exactly know ... I ($_gougou) came here yesterday to deliver some milk and stock to the castle . '' 
Patting down her ($_gougou) clothes , then bending down to pick up the now quiet coocoo hatchling from the ground , she ($_gougou) prattled on , `` I ($_gougou) stopped here with my ($_gougou) last two milk crates I ($_gougou) only stopped for a lil ' spell ... I ($_gougou) guess I ($_gougou) fell asleep again ... '' 
The two guardsmen in front of her ($_gougou) looked between each other and then back at Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) before bursting into a fit of laughter . 
`` Ah , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) , you ($_mitsuki) 're always falling asleep during deliveries '' 
`` But this one sure takes the cake ! You 've never spent the entire night before ! '' 
After placing the coocoo hatchling in the breast pocket of her ($_gougou) shirt , she ($_gougou) slapped her ($_gougou) face in her ($_gougou) hands and moaned woefully , `` Please do n't tease me ($_gougou) , I ($_gougou) ca n't help it ; I ($_gougou) 'm so tired all the time ! '' 
One of the guardsmen wiped a tear from his eye , `` Ah , well ... it could be worse , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) . '' 
"How?" It came out muffled . 
`` Well , '' the other guard continued as he leaned against his spear , `` At least you left Katsuki ($_katsuki) back at the ranch instead of making him wait for you back down in the market , right ? '' 
Suddenly , the_boy_'s ($_iida) words from earlier resonated in her ($_gougou) mind . Her ($_gougou) eyes widened in horror . 
Your ($_gougou) son gave me ($_gougou) the bird to wake you ($_gougou) up ! # . " !" 
The smiles on the guardsmen 's faces dropped . 
`` Oh , gods above '' 
`` Mitsuki , what did you ($_gougou) do ? '' 
`` Ahh , '' pulling at her ($_gougou) hair , the_woman ($_gougou) shook her ($_gougou) head frantically . `` I ($_gougou) messed up bad . Makin ' my ($_gougou) baby wait for me ($_gougou) and then leavin ' him behind what kind ` a motha ' am I ($_gougou) ? '' 
Sighing , the guardsmen shook their heads in exasperation . `` Ah , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) , you ($_mitsuki) 're lucky that boy of yours ($_mitsuki) has his wits about him at such a young age . '' 
`` Honestly , I ($_gougou) 'm sure he 's fine . '' 
Fisting her hands at her sides , she jerked her head up at the sky and sniffled . 
`` He 's really gon na let me ($_gougou) have it when I ($_gougou) get back ... '' 
Brows furrowed in mirth , the guardsmen simply smiled . 
`` He 's not gon na be too hard on you ($_mitsuki) , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) , you ($_mitsuki) know that . '' 
`` Come with us , '' the other guardsman said , a hand extended . `` We 'll make sure you get off the grounds safely . '' 
Still sniffling , the_woman ($_gougou) could only nod her head , `` Okay ... '' 
`` And do n't worry about those last to crates over there , '' a guardsman said as the three of them began walking away . `` We 'll take care of those after we take you back to the market . '' 
`` Thank ya , gentlemen ... I appreciate that ... '' 
Within a matter of seconds , the three had rounded the corner and left the area vacant besides the two crates and the boy and fairy who 'd been hiding behind them . 
Stepping out from their hiding spot , Tenya ($_tenya) sighed , `` Thank goodness that woman did n't give us away . '' 
`` Yeah , '' Katsuki ($_katsuki) mumbled as he ($_katsuki) looked from castle wall to where he ($_katsuki) stood and the small moat in between . 
`` Ah , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , '' the fairy piped . `` How do you suppose we should even get across ? '' 
Looking over the edge of the moat , Katsuki ($_katsuki) saw that the water at this particular section was extremely shallow . The wall was n't even that high ; in fact , it might actually be the same size as 
Turning around , the_boy ($_iida) set to work on pulling the milk crates towards the edge of the moat . They were practically as big as he ($_iida) was , and he ($_iida) heaved as he ($_iida) pulled and pushed to get the first crate in place . Eventually , under only a minute , he ($_iida) was able to push the first crate off the edge and then it fell only a short distance . When it splashed into the water there was still a definitive shatter ; peering over the edge , he ($_iida) saw the bottom of the crate already darken from the water become even more shaded in color . 
Buzzing by his ($_iida) head , Tenya ($_tenya) pointed his ($_iida) hands at him ($_iida) , `` You ($_iida) know , Katsuki ($_katsuki) '' 
`` Iida ($_iida) , no , please '' 
`` I may not have to eat and drink and sleep like you do , '' he ($_iida) scolded . `` but I still understand the value of perishable goods , and , gods above , you just destroyed and wasted perfectly good resources ! '' 
`` Thanks for the lecture , ma ... '' 
The fairy gasped in shock , `` You only learned what that word meant a day ago and you used it to insult me ? That is an insult to Gougou_'s ($_gougou) mother ! '' 
`` Whatever ... '' Shaking his head , Katsuki ($_katsuki) went back to pulling the other crate towards the ledge . Soon he had that crate pushed on top of the other . 
Bending his legs , he jumped up from the ground and scrabbled to the top of the crate . Standing up he looked across the moat and saw the small ledge he could finally jump to . 
Braced again , he pushed himself from the edge of the crate and grabbed onto the creases in the stone wall to keep from falling into the water below . 
Sighing with relief that he 'd made it across in one go , he carefully got down into his hands and while he grimaced at how he had to get soaked in the dripping water again -LRB- seriously what is with getting wet all the time ; waiting for clothes to dry is not fun -RRB- , he pushed forward , through the narrow hole as he began his infiltration into the castle . 
Once out of the hole on the other side of the wall , Katsuki ($_katsuki) sighed as he ($_katsuki) tried to squeeze out the water from his ($_katsuki) clothes . Looking around , he ($_katsuki) did n't see much ; he ($_katsuki) was standing in a small pool of water , a little waterfall to his ($_katsuki) right and a few large barrels and slabs of marble in front of him ($_katsuki) . 
He ($_katsuki) saw a small door on his ($_katsuki) right , and at first , he ($_katsuki) went up to it , trying to see if it would open . But a few good jerks away and against the handle and he ($_katsuki) could tell that the door was n't going to open . He ($_katsuki) 'd have to go straight ahead . 
Walking away from the door , the_boy ($_iida) slowly walked towards a narrow fig that obscured his ($_iida) vision of what lied father down the pathway . Peering around the tree , he ($_iida) quietly swore as he ($_iida) saw an array of guardsmen patrolling the area . He ($_iida) had just narrowly missed running into one of them in that very moment . 
Crouching down behind the fig , he ($_iida) began to formulate his ($_iida) plan . From what he ($_iida) saw in the brief moment he ($_iida) had , a pattern became quite evident . The guardsmen moved almost entirely in unison ; and they were all only spaced apart across one side , one always following the other . They patrolled in a rectangular formation . Logically , all he ($_iida) needed to do is make sure that he ($_iida) 's always behind the last guardsmen when crossing the room , low to the ground and quiet as to not draw attention from the guardsman that might be rounding a corner . 
Yes , it 's perfect , he ($_iida) thought with a grin . This will work , it 's practically foolproof ! 
Twisting his ($_iida) crouched body , he ($_iida) looked around the fig tree once more to get a clear view of when he ($_iida) needed to make his ($_iida) move . Looking down the large , long pathway of shrubbery , marble and guardsmen , Katsuki ($_katsuki) turned to look at his ($_katsuki) fairy companion with a grin . 
`` Hey , Iida ... '' 
`` Oh , gods above , what ? '' 
`` Ready to make all these people look bad at their jobs ? '' 
And make them look bad they did . It was almost comical how they had timed their movements right without fail each and every time . There were so many walls and railings so stone to hide from the guardsmen they 'd just passed and the new guardsmen that came in their way . 
At one point , there was a single guard patrolling a single area , above him ($_iida) was a thick wooden beam that Katsuki ($_katsuki) could climb onto without detection because there was a large row of bushes obstructing the guardsman 's potential view of seeing him ($_iida) . 
As he ($_iida) shuffled across the beam , there was moment when he ($_iida) lost his ($_iida) breath as the guardsman suddenly looked upwards . But , thankfully , it was only for a loud sneeze ; they man 's eyes were closed and when he ($_iida) was done sneezing , his ($_iida) head went back to its level position , staring straight forward . The guardsman simply continued patrolling his area , completely oblivious to the small boy that had crawled to the other side of the beam and dropped down behind another cluster of bushes . 
The last two pairs of guardsmen were arguably more difficult to get past . They never stopped moving and were more perceptive to every little shift in the wind . Nonetheless , the two managed to get past the first pair without complication , waited behind more shrubbery , bidding their time , and then made another dash behind the last pair of guardsmen . Rounding behind another shroud of bushes , the two then slowed their pace and settle for a leisurely stroll as they walked away from the maze of guards . 
Thinking back to how painfully easy it was getting past the oblivious guardsmen , Katsuki and Tenya ($_tenya) were starting to have serious doubts about the competency of the security for the castle . 
`` Honestly , '' the_boy ($_iida) sneered as he ($_iida) felt his ($_iida) feet tap against hard marble once more , his ($_iida) entire body becoming encompassed by the shadow of the large , looming archway that seemed to stretch on and on . `` How did these guys even get their jobs ? They 're worse than Kaminari ($_kaminari) and he ($_kaminari) 's not even a guard . '' 
`` I ($_kaminari) 'm not too sure , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ... '' 
`` Whatever , '' the_boy ($_iida) quipped . `` Let 's go , I ($_kaminari) think this is the end of it . '' 
Quickly running down the archway , the only sound was the rhythmic tapping of Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) shoes against the hard marble of the ground and the soft flow of water . Beyond him ($_katsuki) , he ($_katsuki) saw a large patch of grass , shinned golden from the slowly rising light of the morning . Father ahead , he ($_katsuki) saw a large wall at the end of the pathway , hollowed , carved , and engraved . 
By the time he ($_katsuki) reached the end of the archway , he ($_katsuki) got a whole view of the new area surrounding him ($_katsuki) . On both sides from where he ($_katsuki) stood on the last few tiles of marble , a thin moat of shallow , slow moving water flowed underneath him ($_katsuki) . Looking up , looming tapestries colored with green and gold hung from the sides of the encircling wall before him ($_katsuki) ; the tops of the cloths held the familiar golden triangles stitched in center . Rows upon rows of the grass was filled will blooming plants of varying sizes and colors . To his left , he even saw two tiny figs growing near a patch of peonies . 
Slowly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) began walking deeper inside the area ; looking straight forward , he ($_katsuki) saw a small stairway leading to a large window . The slabs of marble that framed the window curved upwards and then jutted out in angular winged shapes . And in between those wings , he ($_katsuki) saw that inescapable symbol those golden triangles . On the wall around them , thick , elegant vines curled against the stone , intricate patterns forming from their uniform growth , small pink flowers bloomed from the vines , adding a feeling a grace when looking at the small buds . The think railings of the small stairway and the slabs of marble that jutted out and framed the wall had ornate symbols and carvings engraved on their surface . 
But there was one certain detail that Katsuki ($_katsuki) could not miss . Right in front of him ($_katsuki) , peering through the window without a single inkling that he ($_katsuki) was being watched , a person was standing in front of the window . 
The person was no bigger than he ($_katsuki) was , in fact , he ($_katsuki) was probably taller than the person . They were n't wearing anything too fancy ; a long shirt that tucked into a thick red sash around his ($_katsuki) waist . Dark green pants that led to small red boots . The look was unconventional and it made his eyes hurt , but it definitely made the person stand out . It did n't take a genius to know that this was the person he was looking for . 
But there was still that doubt . What if he was n't the prince ? What if this was just some random person and if he spotted him , he 'd be thrown out of the castle immediately . They 'd boost their security . He might not find another way back into the castle . He might get thrown out of the town . He 'll fail - how was he supposed to save Yuuei if he could n't even find the stupid prince 
Shaking his head , he stared at the ground in frustration . What 's wrong with me ? Why am I hesitating ? I know I 'm right ! 
He may not be able to see the persons face , but he knew that frazzled head of hair . It was too familiar , too surreal for it not to be true . 
Face scrunching up in determination , he looked up and slowly began walking up the small stairway . His steps were light , so he would n't give himself away too soon . The boy in front of him was much too focused on what was beyond the window to pay attention to the other boy slowly coming up behind him . 
Once at the top of the stairs , only a few feet of distance between them , Katsuki ($_katsuki) could only help but stare . There was so much riding in this single moment , on a single choice . Fists clenched at his sides , he blinked away his hesitation . 
With great trepidation finally washing away , he reached out a hand and called out to the boy in front of him . 
`` H. . . hey ! '' 
The kid jumped a little before pivoting his body and turning to face him . The dark swath of unruly hair that shinned green where the light hit it just right ; the splash of freckles on his cheeks ; the bright green of his eyes that rivaled the vitality of fricking Yousei Forest this was him . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) recognized that face with startling clarity ; the boy from all his dreams and nightmares . He saw him , and as he locked eyes with the startled boy , he knew he 'd never forget him .
