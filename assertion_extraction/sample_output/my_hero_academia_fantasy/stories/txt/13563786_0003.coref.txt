It took a while for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to get around to giving Izuku ($_izuku) a change of clothes . He saw it as more important to make sure that his new servant knew his way around the castle , explaining to the young man what his duties would be and letting him know to go to Kirishima with any questions if he had them . 
Down this way is where Kirishima ($_kirishima) s room is . Don ($_don) t throw out his ($_don) shed scales , we can usually trade them for shit . 
Oh , is that why you ($_don) never made demands of the village before now ? 
Tch , of course . Those extras can barely feed themselves . Why make it harder on them ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) leads Izuku ($_izuku) up a curving staircase and into a wide hall with many narrow windows cut into the stone facing out over the courtyard below . At first Izuku ($_izuku) wondered why there were so many if they were going to be so small , but shrugs it off . 
This is my room . Bakugou waves his ($_don) hand at a large double door . Don ($_don) t break anything when you ($_don) re cleaning it . His ($_don) arm moves to point further down the hall to a smaller single door . That s your ($_don) room . Keep it clean or not , it 's your ($_don) space . Just don t slack off on the rest of the place . 
Um , thanks . Izuku twists the skirt of the dress he ($_don) is still wearing in his ($_don) hands , not sure if he ($_don) should ask after a change of clothes or not . Lord Bakugou seems to be fair , if not a bit abrasive . He ($_don) wasn t sure how he ($_don) would react if asked . 
Hey , Izuku ($_izuku) ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) comes running into the hall from the far end , opposite where Izuku ($_izuku) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) entered from . He ($_don) s wearing a loose grey tunic and seems to be carrying something draped over his ($_don) arm . I found you ($_don) something that might fit . I figured Bakugou ($_bakugou) might have forgotten about the change of clothes he ($_bakugou) promised you ($_don) . 
I didn t forget you ($_don) idiot ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) is glowering at the redhead and being ignored by him ($_bakugou) . I was just about to let him ($_bakugou) go to his ($_bakugou) room and change ! 
To a room we had set up with girl s clothes ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) looks at his ($_kirishima) lord with a smug smile . Bakugou ($_bakugou) just grinds his ($_bakugou) teeth in response . 
Anyway. We can find you ($_don) some other clothes when we get a chance to go to the town on the fair side of the mountains . It 's where I usually go to trade for things . These should do for now though . He ($_bakugou) holds the bundle of clothes out to Izuku , who takes them with a smile . 
Thank you ($_don) . He ($_bakugou) looks between Kirishima ($_kirishima) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) , who is now pouting like some petulant child , before making his ($_bakugou) way down the hall to the room Bakugou ($_bakugou) had said would be his ($_bakugou) . 
As he ($_bakugou) opens the door he ($_bakugou) hears Kirishima ($_kirishima) speaking softly with Bakugou ($_bakugou) , but pays it no mind as he ($_bakugou) steps into the room , pulling the door closed behind him ($_bakugou) . 
The room surprises him ($_bakugou) a bit . It was a bit dusty , the furniture looking as if it had been in the room for years without being used . However the blankets on the bed seemed to be fresh , so he ($_bakugou) was fairly certain that Kirishima ($_kirishima) had taken the time to make sure that any moth eaten fabrics had been removed , even if the place was thick enough with dust to leave footprints . 
Speaking of footprints there was a trail of them leading to a wardrobe . Thinking back to Kirishima s comment on them expecting a girl , he ($_bakugou) figured there would be more dresses in there and ignores it for now . Instead he ($_bakugou) lays the bundle Kirishima ($_kirishima) had given him ($_bakugou) out on the bed to see what he ($_bakugou) had to work with . A white long sleeved tunic , green trousers , and a green doublet . 
He ($_bakugou) must have been trying to match my hair . 
Shrugging at the thought he ($_bakugou) begins to look for how he ($_bakugou) can get this dress off . The white dress is reminiscent of what he ($_bakugou) s seen the village girls wear for their weddings , a tight bodice that ties in the back over a white shift . It was meant to show innocence , purity , and dependency on their new husband as untying it on their own was difficult . Letting out a sigh he ($_bakugou) wonders if it would be more embarrassing to have to cut the thing off or just ask for help in unlacing it .

After Izuku ($_izuku) had moved toward his ($_izuku) room Kirishima ($_kirishima) speaks to his ($_izuku) lord in a soft tone , not wanting to let Izuku ($_izuku) hear what he ($_izuku) was about to discuss . 
You wanted to keep having him ($_izuku) wear that dress , didn t you ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) grinds his ($_bakugou) teeth , turning his ($_bakugou) nose up from his ($_bakugou) companion . As if. 
I ll admit it did suit him ($_bakugou) , made him ($_bakugou) seem real cute , but I doubt he ($_bakugou) feels the same way . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) glances over at Kirishima ($_kirishima) , pink dusting his ($_bakugou) cheeks ever so slightly despite the murderous look in his ($_bakugou) eyes . Shut the hell up . Fucking extras can t follow basic commands and send him ($_bakugou) up here dressed like that . 
You re not denying it . Kirishima ($_kirishima) almost sings the words , giddy at the thought his ($_bakugou) lord actually liked someone for once . 
Growling , Bakugou ($_bakugou) turns and heads down the hall . I ll be hearing court . Make sure that newbie gets dinner before he goes to bed . He starts work in the morning . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins before they both hear the door behind him open and a hesitant voice speaks up . 
Um, uh. Kirishima ($_kirishima) . I can t get this thing off on my own . a pause in which Kirishima witnesses the absolutely murderous look shot his way by the beast king that was waiting at the end of the hall , paused in his attempt to leave Kirishima ($_kirishima) and his teasing behind . 
Do you ($_kirishima) need some help then ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) goes as if to turn , but before he can even take his eyes off of the blonde at the far end of the hall , said blonde is already striding toward the green haired boy s room . 
I ll help him with that . Go get the cases organized for when I get down there . I don t want to hear fifty complaints about who stole whose nuts again . Bakugou storms past Kirishima nd pushes a_startled_Izuku ($_a) into his ($_a) room before slamming the door behind them . Kirishima ($_kirishima) can hear the_poor_boy ($_a) s protests that Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t need to do anything before Bakugou ($_bakugou) snapped out at him ($_a) that he ($_a) was the one who needed help and he ($_a) wasn t busy anyway . 
Smiling Kirishima ($_kirishima) shakes his ($_a) head and makes his ($_a) way down to the grand hall where he ($_a) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) would usually eat and where the beast king held court . He ($_a) wasn t kidding about those squirrels though , they do tend to argue about nuts a lot .
