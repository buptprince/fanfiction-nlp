The crackling of fire wakes Bakugou from his dreams of fighting . Bolting upright , he scans the scene in front of him with wide eyes and heavy breathing . Reflexively , he reaches for his cutlass , but can t locate it in fact , his whole belt is absent , along with the bindings around his arms and ankles , where he stores all the miscellaneous daggers he s gathered during his travels . A quick survey of his body reveals he s been stripped of the majority of his gear , leaving him in only a pair of leather pants and a loosely fitted shirt over a heavily bandaged torso . The shirt looks vaguely familiar , but it takes him a moment to recognize Kirishima ($_kirishima) s scent on it . 
Based on Bakugou s memory of being knocked out during combat , smelling Kirishima nearby isn t a good sign . Kirishima ($_kirishima) should be up in the sky , where his ($_kirishima) true advantage lies . If Kirishima ($_kirishima) s been seriously injured , Bakugou ($_bakugou) needs to move him ($_kirishima) somewhere safe until he ($_kirishima) recovers . In a worst-case scenario , Kirishima ($_kirishima) s their ($_kirishima) most reliable means of escape . 
But before Bakugou ($_bakugou) can map out a course of action , he ($_bakugou) feels a weight being applied to his ($_bakugou) shoulders , lowering him ($_bakugou) back onto the grassy earth , firmly but with tender consideration for his ($_bakugou) wounds and agitated state . 
Hey. Hey , Bakugou , everything s all right , a reassuring voice caresses Bakugou ($_bakugou) s ear , disarming part of his ($_bakugou) guard before he ($_bakugou) can process what it means or why he ($_bakugou) s so inclined to trust it . Swinging his ($_bakugou) head around , he ($_bakugou) discovers Kirishima ($_kirishima) staring kindly back at him ($_bakugou) . And Kirishima ($_kirishima) s in perfect health , as far as Bakugou ($_bakugou) can tell . 
Relief hits Bakugou like the branch of a tree boomeranging into the back of his ($_bakugou) head , but he ($_bakugou) s confused as well , expecting Kirishima ($_kirishima) to quickly explain the situation to him ($_bakugou) . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) merely hovers over Bakugou ($_bakugou) with a placid smile , the sort Bakugou recognizes from when Kirishima ($_kirishima) s trying to not infect an already distressed Bakugou with his ($_bakugou) own worries . 
Releasing Bakugou ($_bakugou) , Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands roam freely in search of sores he ($_bakugou) might ve missed during his ($_bakugou) earlier inspection of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s unconscious body , caressing the side of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s face and then his ($_bakugou) head , which ruffles his ($_bakugou) hair . It s almost pleasant , except his ($_bakugou) stomach feels sick : butterflies that crash into each other on purpose in an attempt to tear down the whole suggestion of sappy sentiments . A hand brushes Bakugou ($_bakugou) s collarbone , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) seems to think better of venturing there right now and withdraws . 
During this moment , which feels unbearably long to Bakugou , he ($_bakugou) has no idea what s happening why he ($_bakugou) s lying down , why his ($_bakugou) chest aches as if it s been branded with hot iron , why there s a huge gap in his ($_bakugou) recent memory , why Kirishima ($_kirishima) s treating him ($_bakugou) this way . Frustration floods his ($_bakugou) face with heat , making him ($_bakugou) blush a glaring shade of red . He ($_bakugou) feels like he ($_bakugou) s been dumped into the climax of a scene he ($_bakugou) hasn t been following for the last day or so , and therefore can t know how to respond . 
Take it easy , man . You re still hurt , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , bringing Bakugou ($_bakugou) back to reality and clearing his ($_bakugou) head of useless ideas . He ($_bakugou) must ve made a fatal miscalculation during the fight , leading to his ($_bakugou) forced resignation , but fortunately Kirishima ($_kirishima) seems to have settled it in their favor . Technically ($_technically) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) s been saved , but admitting that right now would prove too ambitious , so it ($_technically) doesn t cross his ($_bakugou) mind at all . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s been sitting next to Bakugou ($_bakugou) ever since all night long , in fact , waiting patiently to pacify him ($_bakugou) when he ($_bakugou) inevitably arouse with his ($_bakugou) fight or flight response still engaged . 
Grimacing to banish the dumbstruck look on his ($_bakugou) face , Bakugou ($_bakugou) touches his ($_bakugou) throbbing temple and groans . He ($_bakugou) tries again to sit up , and again Kirishima ($_kirishima) insists on stopping him ($_bakugou) , shoving harder and more urgently this time . Bakugou snarls in response , which Kirishima ($_kirishima) ignores , getting on his ($_bakugou) knees so he ($_bakugou) can continue holding Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulders while hovering over him ($_bakugou) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s shadow casts a perfect eclipse across Bakugou ($_bakugou) s body . 
No , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says firmly , frowning to communicate how serious he ($_bakugou) is . Stop trying to get up. You need rest . 
Insulted , Bakugou ($_bakugou) attempts to bark a retort , but his ($_bakugou) throat is raw and turns his ($_bakugou) voice into a nasty cough . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s expression softens as he ($_bakugou) brushes back the hair stuck to Bakugou s forehead , tucking it behind his ($_bakugou) ear before wiping some dirty blood smeared on his ($_bakugou) cheek . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s startled by this tenderness , as if Kirishima ($_kirishima) s overjoyed just to watch Bakugou ($_bakugou) breathe consciously again . Was Kirishima ($_kirishima) worried Bakugou ($_bakugou) wouldn t wake up at all ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s head buzzes with conflicting feelings . He ($_bakugou) s not the sort that s ever felt he ($_bakugou) can afford to wallow in his ($_bakugou) injuries or waste any longer than absolutely necessary tending to them . When his ($_bakugou) state offered no alternative , he ($_bakugou) even operated on himself ($_bakugou) , not trusting anyone else to touch or even see his ($_bakugou) body . So what if his ($_bakugou) body hurts a little more and heals a little slower because he ($_bakugou) continues traveling ? The outcome s the same in the end , and he ($_bakugou) s always scraped by just fine . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s already done a decent job of patching_Bakugou ($_bakugou) up so he ($_bakugou) doesn t bleed all over the place or break any additional bones , so there s no excuse for lying around idly like this . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s always made it ($_bakugou) clear that this is how he ($_bakugou) does things , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) should know better than to challenge him ($_bakugou) . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) s been trying to do just that pretty much since they met , and , while Bakugou ($_bakugou) s let him ($_bakugou) get away with a couple of minor bits of assistance here and there , they ve done far from satisfy Kirishima , who s been waiting for his ($_bakugou) chance to do more . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) has absolutely no intention of discovering what it s like to be nursed back to health . He ($_bakugou) draws the line at being bandaged and watched over while unconscious . 
Don t you dare tell me what to fucking d ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) snaps , halting abruptly as he ($_bakugou) reaches a dreadful realization . Fear ignites his ($_bakugou) eyes like a spark before a forest fire , hands traveling to the bandages bound tightly around his ($_bakugou) torso as if in search of something he ($_bakugou) forgot he ($_bakugou) hid between them . It s a reckless display of discomfort , immediately alerting Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
Are you all right ? Did the bleeding start again ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) inquires through a concerned frown , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) shows no intention of answering , just stares wide-eyed and ashen at his ($_bakugou) own trembling hands . Anger and grief collide in his ($_bakugou) mind like dead stars suddenly bursting back into life a fear he ($_bakugou) d long quarantined behind all his ($_bakugou) precautions . 
Then Bakugou ($_bakugou) s breathing becomes erratic , as if he ($_bakugou) s only barely keeping himself ($_bakugou) from hyperventilating . Kirishima_,_fearing_Bakugou_s_asphyxiating ($_asphyxiating) Bakugou ($_bakugou) s asphyxiating , attempts to rip off the constraints across his ($_bakugou) chest , but he ($_bakugou) slaps Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand away before it ($_asphyxiating) can touch him ($_bakugou) . 
Don t fucking touch me ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) snaps , shoving Kirishima ($_kirishima) away with the clear intent to do damage and standing upright . Bakugou ($_bakugou) staggers a little , the pain in his ($_bakugou) upper body magnified by the pull of gravity , but he ($_bakugou) manages to stabilize his ($_bakugou) balance , all while keeping his ($_bakugou) weary eyes on Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) stares in bewildered anguish as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s countenance spells out disgust , teeth bared in a full snarl and eyes narrowed to glare . That inkling of hatred , which is rapidly expanding , hurts Kirishima ($_kirishima) the most . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) knows he ($_kirishima) s done something bad , something that , even if he ($_kirishima) meant no harm by it , can only be treated with contempt and animosity . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) doesn t know what he ($_kirishima) did , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) s not the sort to explain when he ($_kirishima) s been wronged , so Kirishima ($_kirishima) has no idea where to even begin trying to make amends . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s treating Kirishima ($_kirishima) like his ($_bakugou) enemy , and if there s one thing Kirishima ($_kirishima) knows about Bakugou ($_bakugou) s enemies is they re all attacked relentlessly until defeated . Yet this feels different , as if terror s seeped into his ($_bakugou) bones , sowing the possibility of making a run for it . Such cowardice does not suit Bakugou ($_bakugou) , but neither does turning on Kirishima ($_kirishima) this way he ($_bakugou) s become too unpredictable . 
Afraid of losing his ($_bakugou) best friend , Kirishima ($_kirishima) makes a foolish attempt at grabbing Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) answers with a fistful of explosions . 
I told you ($_bakugou) to stay the fuck away from me ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) yells , lighting both of his ($_bakugou) palms with volatile magic to show he ($_bakugou) s serious . He ($_bakugou) ll attack if Kirishima ($_kirishima) tries to get closer again . 
I told you ($_bakugou) to always , always stay the fuck away from me ! 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) hates being touched . He ($_bakugou) warned Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
Mortified_,_Kirishima ($_mortified) s physical strength caves and he ($_bakugou) drops to his ($_bakugou) knees . He ($_bakugou) knows now what he ($_bakugou) s done , and it ($_mortified) s a terrible thing indeed a necessary thing , which Kirishima ($_kirishima) had to do to save Bakugou ($_bakugou) s life , but a terrible thing nonetheless . And Kirishima ($_kirishima) took too long to consider how Bakugou ($_bakugou) would react as he ($_bakugou) would , inevitably , realize what Kirishima ($_kirishima) had done , foolishly assuming he ($_bakugou) d have time to breach the topic securely , to explain . He ($_bakugou) should ve realized this would be the first thing Bakugou ($_bakugou) would freak out about , his ($_bakugou) injuries be damned . 
Now Bakugou ($_bakugou) s reinstituting all of his ($_bakugou) defenses all these defenses he ($_bakugou) didn t need around Kirishima ($_kirishima) anymore , had foregone for the comfort of having someone he ($_bakugou) could almost be completely open around . There was one barrier Bakugou ($_bakugou) never removed around Kirishima , which Kirishima ($_kirishima) understood the reason for by the time he ($_bakugou) could call Bakugou ($_bakugou) a friend . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) never made any move to try to address it , because he ($_bakugou) wasn t yet ready himself ($_bakugou) to admit how he ($_bakugou) related to it . 
Now it s obvious Kirishima ($_kirishima) knows and Bakugou ($_bakugou) never wanted him ($_bakugou) to least of all like this , when it was utterly out of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s control . Kirishima ($_kirishima) betrayed Bakugou ($_bakugou) s trust in the worst way fathomable . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew Bakugou ($_bakugou) would never be upfront about it ($_kirishima) on his ($_bakugou) own , but maybe , if Kirishima ($_kirishima) had opened up first , Bakugou ($_bakugou) would ve seen he ($_bakugou) could , too . Isn t that the reason Kirishima chose to travel with Bakugou ($_bakugou) , because he ($_bakugou) was searching for someone to share all of his ($_bakugou) secrets with ? 
Why did he ($_bakugou) wait so long say something ? Out of fear_Bakugou ($_bakugou) would hate him ($_bakugou) anyway , just for knowing ? Or because he ($_bakugou) knew he ($_bakugou) d be viewed differently afterwards ? 
Was it a force of habit he ($_bakugou) couldn t break free from , after spending so many years depending on camouflage for survival ? 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) lowers his ($_kirishima) grief-stricken face and presses a fist to his ($_kirishima) forehead . An apology tugs at his ($_kirishima) vocal cords , but his ($_kirishima) emotions are all jumbled up , and he ($_kirishima) can t trust them to translate into words properly . He ($_kirishima) needs to be careful , not reckless . Blurting everything out at once will just confuse and upset Bakugou ($_bakugou) further . 
I should ve told you . After I knew , I should ve Kirishima ($_kirishima) stammers , forced to take a deep , hiccupping breath when his ($_kirishima) voice cracks . He ($_kirishima) s crying . He ($_kirishima) s crying and Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shocked , unable to fathom why , unable to comprehend Kirishima ($_kirishima) s sadness or guilt , how he ($_kirishima) s falling apart right in front of Bakugou ($_bakugou) . It s not the sort of reaction Bakugou ($_bakugou) s used to , and he ($_kirishima) hates that hates it more than if Kirishima ($_kirishima) were angry and shouting back , telling him ($_kirishima) off . In such a scenario , Bakugou ($_bakugou) would at least know how to counter , and it d be easy , so easy , to cut Kirishima ($_kirishima) off completely . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) does not stick around until he ($_bakugou) s humiliated . He ($_bakugou) s always kept people at arm s length so they can t suspect anything s amiss with him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) s the prince of having lots of admires and no friends soon to be king . 
I don t care what you fucking think ! Bakugou retorts , reaching deep inside for the script he ($_bakugou) knows , the raw desire to fright on his ($_bakugou) behalf . It s been so long since he ($_bakugou) confronted someone over this and , while he ($_bakugou) can t say he ($_bakugou) s missed it , he ($_bakugou) s certainly been building up his ($_bakugou) rage to a boiling point . I don t want your damn pity , either ! Just save it , because you re full of shit like everyone else ! 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) shakes his ($_kirishima) head , but that far from appeases Bakugou ($_bakugou) . He ($_kirishima) s furious at the fact that he ($_kirishima) s being affected by Kirishima ($_kirishima) s feelings a knot in his ($_kirishima) stomach , a nail against his ($_kirishima) ribcage . He ($_kirishima) has to grind his ($_kirishima) teeth and blink rapidly to keep the water in his ($_kirishima) eyes from spilling . He ($_kirishima) is real fucking tired of this body not doing and being what he ($_kirishima) wants . 
Stay the hell away from me from now on ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) spits . He ($_kirishima) makes a move to leave , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) lifts his ($_kirishima) face , forcing Bakugou ($_bakugou) to look directly at him ($_kirishima) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) freezes . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) knows he ($_kirishima) can t afford to waste time . Gathering his ($_kirishima) strength , he ($_kirishima) wipes his ($_kirishima) eyes raw and stands . Being around Bakugou ($_bakugou) has taught him ($_kirishima) to not smother people with his ($_kirishima) feelings . He ($_kirishima) needs to communicate concisely to turn this situation around . 
Remember when I told you I ran away from something back home ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , his ($_kirishima) voice tender like a fresh scab but resolute to harden again if scratched off , as many times as necessary . 
Bakugou sneers at Kirishima ($_kirishima) s attempt to empathize . 
Yeah , cause you re a dragon and everyone wants you fucking dead ! He ($_kirishima) yells , carelessly or deliberately which would be worse ? , snapping several of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s heartstrings in an instant . Kirishima ($_kirishima) winces , but swallows his ($_kirishima) anger , willing just this once to forgive Bakugou ($_bakugou) for thinking his ($_kirishima) own suffering justifies inflicting it on others . 
And do you know why I can turn into a dragon ? 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s stare is severe , as if challenging Bakugou to accept the answer to this question . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) merely scoffs , rolling his ($_bakugou) eyes to show he ($_bakugou) doesn t know and doesn t care . But he ($_bakugou) s still listening . 
I inherited transformation magic from my mothers , but they can only partly transform , Kirishima ($_kirishima) explains , pausing to swallow a knot of sadness before admitting the next part . Which is why they ve never been regarded as dangerous . Or inhuman. 
He ($_bakugou) s both frightened and relieved to finally get to confide in someone even though he ($_bakugou) trusts Bakugou , he ($_bakugou) doesn t trust what Bakugou ($_bakugou) might say or do right now . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chosen the worst scenario to do this , but he ($_bakugou) really has no choice anymore . 
I was supposed to be the same , but , well , when I was a kid , I really wanted to be someone else . Someone completely different from myself . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s making a conscious effort to not care about what Kirishima ($_kirishima) s saying , but he ($_bakugou) can t help reading into it . He ($_bakugou) s searching for the reason , how this all connects to what happened . Is Kirishima ($_kirishima) merely trying to apologize , or does he ($_bakugou) aim to make up for his ($_bakugou) mistake by revealing something about himself ($_bakugou) ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) tells himself ($_bakugou) it doesn t matter , because nothing Kirishima says can be of equal value as what he ($_bakugou) s taken from Bakugou ($_bakugou) . And , anyway , Bakugou ($_bakugou) s unwilling to forgive Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s only letting Kirishima ($_kirishima) talk so he ($_bakugou) can sneer at it after , show Kirishima how little Bakugou ($_bakugou) really values this precious trust placed in him ($_bakugou) . As far as he ($_bakugou) s concerned , it s only fair . 
I ($_i) knew I ($_i) could use magic to change into anything , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , closing his ($_kirishima) eyes and taking a deep , tranquilizing breath . So I ($_i) worked really hard to forget the body I ($_i) d been born with and visualize a new one . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s face scrunches up as he ($_kirishima) concentrates . Usually , he ($_kirishima) can transform into a dragon pretty quickly , but now he ($_kirishima) looks like he ($_kirishima) s trying to recall a different form , one he ($_kirishima) once wore as often and confidently but hasn t visited in a while . Then , his ($_kirishima) body changes , starting in ways Bakugou ($_bakugou) recognizes and gradually adding more subtle novelties . 
While Kirishima ($_kirishima) s skin hardens into crimson scales , his ($_kirishima) bone structure rearranges . The contour of his ($_kirishima) face sharpens , accentuating his ($_kirishima) jawline and thinning his ($_kirishima) cheeks . The wings that form on his ($_kirishima) back seem to tug at his ($_kirishima) torso , broadening his ($_kirishima) shoulder area . His ($_kirishima) limbs thicken as his ($_kirishima) muscle mass increases and he ($_kirishima) grows taller . His ($_kirishima) hands become larger as well as sprout claws . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s in this transitional stage , still overall human but with a few reptilian traits , like wings and sharper teeth and a tail . Scales blossom across parts of his ($_kirishima) body , but don t cover him ($_kirishima) completely . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s only seen versions of it a handful of times in the past , to facilitate fighting or traveling or foraging . 
Bakugou gasps , his ($_kirishima) outward anger replaced by awe , which , in turn , gradually crystallizes into envy . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s made a startling discovery . 
While the absence of these new traits never made Bakugou ($_bakugou) read Kirishima ($_kirishima) as anything but what he ($_bakugou) claimed to be , watching them manifest in unison establishes such a stark contrast with how Kirishima ($_kirishima) normally appears , that Bakugou ($_bakugou) has to acknowledge their meaning . These are , after all , some of the traits Bakugou ($_bakugou) s coveted as well . 
When Kirishima ($_kirishima) speaks again , Bakugou ($_bakugou) notices something else : Kirishima ($_kirishima) s voice is deeper . 
You said you wanted to partner with a dragon because you needed to prove you re a real prince , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , nervously , like he ($_bakugou) s unsure how successful he ($_bakugou) s being at communicating his ($_bakugou) message . He ($_bakugou) seems just as surprised as Bakugou ($_bakugou) by this new voice . 
But Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly gains confidence , snorting before adding , because , in your words , nothing s manlier than a fucking dragon . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) makes no secret of the affection and pride he ($_kirishima) feels as he ($_kirishima) recalls this . He ($_kirishima) can never be too careful when he ($_kirishima) hears about someone interested in finding a dragon , so he ($_kirishima) made sure to ask Bakugou ($_bakugou) what he ($_kirishima) wanted it for for slaying , perhaps ? And Bakugou ($_bakugou) s response was perfect , exactly the sort Kirishima had been looking for : killing a dragon is easy ! But gaining its trust ? That takes real skill ! Plus , when I bring it back home , no one will dare doubt I m a prince ! 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) was captivated by the chance to battle alongside such a fascinating stranger , who so happened to have an extremely manly goal as well . The fact Kirishima ($_kirishima) might wind up as some kind of royal dragon knight to the future ruler of a kingdom was pretty enticing , too . 
Once Kirishima ($_kirishima) revealed that the dragon he ($_kirishima) d promised to show Bakugou ($_bakugou) was none other than himself ($_kirishima) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) lost interest , claiming there was no point in getting friendly with some human dork that just happened to possess a bit of transformation magic . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) was determined to show Bakugou he ($_kirishima) could be a worthy ally by challenging him ($_kirishima) to a fight , of course . 
And prove himself ($_kirishima) Kirishima ($_kirishima) did . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins , broad and earnest , squeezing in as many of his ($_kirishima) razor-sharp teeth as he ($_kirishima) can . Then he ($_kirishima) forms a fist and exclaims , well , I ve always thought dragons are the manliest , too ! 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) understands . 
Transformation magic is too taxing on the human body to be performed constantly , but the exact limitations depend on the complexity of the transformation and skill of the user . The fact that Kirishima ($_kirishima) can remain in full dragon form for a solid three to four hours is proof not only of his tremendous power , but also of how he required it to survive . 
How long has it been since he left his home village ? How advanced was his magic back then ? Even changing one s human appearance takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration . If Kirishima ($_kirishima) was using his ($_kirishima) magic every time he ($_kirishima) left the house , he ($_kirishima) couldn t have afforded to stay out for very long . But he ($_kirishima) probably had to . Often. Often enough that people started noticing and figured out what he ($_kirishima) was doing . 
They must ve justified their disapproval by claiming he ($_kirishima) could use such magic to impersonate someone else , to hide his ($_kirishima) true identity , to trick people . But that s never the only reason not even the most important one . 
And Bakugou ($_bakugou) thought binding his ($_bakugou) chest was a fucking pain . 
People don t hate you because you re a dragon , Bakugou ($_bakugou) says flatly . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) winces . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s right , of course , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) would rather not think about it . He ($_bakugou) shakes off his ($_bakugou) melancholy with a shrug . 
They do now . I prefer it this way . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s astonished by the magnitude of his ($_bakugou) indignation . He ($_bakugou) s familiar enough with being indignant on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s behalf , but this takes it ($_kirishima) to a whole new level . Perhaps because the rage Bakugou would feel in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s situation is far too great to fathom someone else making peace with it . 
Striding over to Kirishima , Bakugou ($_bakugou) glares up at Kirishima ($_kirishima) with an irritated pout , resentful that he ($_bakugou) s shorter now and has to lift his ($_bakugou) head . He ($_bakugou) drums an accusing finger against Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest while yelling , so it ($_kirishima) s better to be hated for being a literal fucking monster than for ! 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) grits his ($_bakugou) teeth , discovering too late he ($_bakugou) s incapable of uttering the rest . He ($_bakugou) s not strong enough . Or maybe just not mean enough. This is a truth that s hurt him ($_bakugou) as much as it s hurt Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand becomes a fist , shivering slightly from frustration . He ($_bakugou) won t look away from Kirishima ($_kirishima) , won t let him ($_bakugou) think for a second that he ($_bakugou) s off the hook just because of this . Gradually , Kirishima ($_kirishima) starts returning to normal , the red bleeding out of his ($_bakugou) skin like it s been scared away , his ($_bakugou) face softening until Bakugou ($_bakugou) sees the sad , tired face of his ($_bakugou) best friend when he ($_bakugou) s been defeated . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s smiling slightly still , as if Bakugou ($_bakugou) s done him ($_bakugou) some grand favor he ($_bakugou) never imagined anyone would . 
Slowly unfurling Bakugou ($_bakugou) s fist , Kirishima ($_kirishima) discovers their hands are perfectly sized for each other . Bakugou ($_bakugou) doesn t seem to mind that they re holding hands . 
At least we know what we are , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) can tell it ($_bakugou) took Kirishima ($_kirishima) a long time to figure that out much longer than Bakugou ($_bakugou) , who s always been certain , ever since he ($_bakugou) can recall being aware of himself ($_bakugou) . 
They are similar , but different . 
I should ve told you sooner . 
Yeah. You should ve , Bakugou ($_bakugou) agrees , but even he ($_bakugou) can t know how he ($_bakugou) would ve reacted if that d happened , if it would ve been any easier or smoother than what they ended up with . A degree of fear and discomfort was inevitable . 
Then Kirishima ($_kirishima) does something completely unplanned , something he ($_bakugou) s only rehearsed in his ($_bakugou) mind , late at night while dozing off at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s side Kirishima ($_kirishima) lifts Bakugou ($_bakugou) s knuckles to his ($_bakugou) face and kisses them . 
Remarkably enough , Kirishima ($_kirishima) looks more distraught than Bakugou ($_bakugou) over it , blushing bright red and grimacing . Bakugou ($_bakugou) just kinda goes rigid for a moment . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) feels the return of those awful butterflies from earlier , part pleasure and part fear , like the thrill of leaping from Kirishima ($_kirishima) s back while in flight and then being caught midair yet , it occurs to Bakugou , maybe that s just how Kirishima ($_kirishima) makes him ($_bakugou) feel in general . 
It ll take time for Bakugou ($_bakugou) to adjust to Kirishima ($_kirishima) knowing he ($_bakugou) s trans time for him ($_bakugou) to learn he ($_bakugou) doesn t have to worry all the time about being caught or go to such laborious lengths to hide himself ($_bakugou) ; time to open up about what it means to him ($_bakugou) and what he ($_bakugou) s had to do to survive ; time to accept Kirishima ($_kirishima) s empathy as respect rather than scorn . Yet he ($_bakugou) can feel a definitive shift , the disappearance of the last barrier that stood between him ($_bakugou) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Now Bakugou ($_bakugou) can choose to be completely open he ($_bakugou) doesn t have to be , and he ($_bakugou) doesn t have to be all the time , but the option exists . For the first time , the option exists . 
Maybe , if things go well , Bakugou ($_bakugou) ll even allow himself ($_bakugou) to reconsider his ($_bakugou) feelings for Kirishima ($_kirishima) . It s a bit obvious now that Kirishima ($_kirishima) thinks of him ($_bakugou) as more than a friend , and he ($_bakugou) s surprisingly unbothered by it . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) seems to have felt this way for a while now , despite the fact that Kirishima ($_kirishima) didn t know Bakugou ($_bakugou) was trans , or how Bakugou ($_bakugou) would react to knowing Kirishima ($_kirishima) was trans . Kirishima ($_kirishima) might ve been afraid of a lot of things , but letting himself ($_kirishima) love Bakugou ($_bakugou) wasn t one of them . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) attempts to smile back at Kirishima ($_kirishima) , but it s lopsided and looks a bit like a snarl . He ($_bakugou) s not used to not smirking . 
It s enough for Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
Remember what I told you about my first battle scars ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asks . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) quirks a confused eyebrow . You said you get fighting for your life . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s flattered Bakugou ($_bakugou) actually remembers . He ($_bakugou) s a better listener than he ($_bakugou) lets anyone give him ($_bakugou) credit for . 
Kirishima presses Bakugou ($_bakugou) s palm to his ($_bakugou) chest his ($_bakugou) perfectly chiseled chest , which Bakugou ($_bakugou) quietly envies . It takes him ($_bakugou) a moment , but then he ($_bakugou) feels the scar bisecting Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest , thin and curved like a long crescent moon . Bakugou ($_bakugou) raises his ($_bakugou) other hand and feels the twin scar on the other side . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) shoots Kirishima ($_kirishima) an impressed look . So it was there all along , no magic involved .
