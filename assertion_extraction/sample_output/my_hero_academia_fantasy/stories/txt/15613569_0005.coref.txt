The moon had already risen by the time Kirishima and Bakugou ($_bakugou) arrived back at the mountain . Both of them grinning madly about their flight , though more Kirishima than Bakugou , who was more focused on trying to hide his joy , so he didn t appear weak . 
Dinner ? asked Kirishima , as he began setting out some plates 
Sure said Bakugou ($_bakugou) . He paused for a minute , feeling a little bit bored and useless . He looked over at Kirishima ($_kirishima) with a slight tint of pink in his cheeks . The way Kirishima always looked happy made Bakugou feel happy inside . But he felt bad , he felt like Kirishima ($_kirishima) was doing so much for him , he felt like he had to do something back . 
Do , you need any help or whatever said Bakugou ($_bakugou) , turning his ($_bakugou) head away from Kirishima ($_kirishima) , trying to not feel embarrassed . 
As if on command Kirishima ($_kirishima) s face automatically lit up with pure joy . 
Sure! I d love that ! he said , without skipping a beat , If you could cut the vegetables that d be really great ! 
Vegetables , tch said Bakugou ($_bakugou) , Surely if your dad was asleep half the time you d try to skip out on vegetables 
Nah , they keep me strong and being strong is manly so a mans got ta do what a mans got ta do I guess he said , while rubbing the back of his neck . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) shrugged before he ($_bakugou) began cutting the vegetables rapidly . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stared in utter awe as Bakugou ($_bakugou) cut the vegetables at an extreme speed , he ($_bakugou) was seeing double of his ($_bakugou) hands he ($_bakugou) was moving so fast . 
Jesus , calm it blasty you re gon na break the table ! giggled Kirishima ($_kirishima) 
Fuck off! I ll do it how I want ! he ($_bakugou) said , not even breaking a sweat . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) laughed as he ($_bakugou) went back to preparing the meat . The two boiled the vegetables and properly cooked the meat through , with a lot of help from Bakugou ($_bakugou) s explosions , before they moved over to the large open ledge to eat their dinner . 
I was wondering said Bakugou ($_bakugou) with a mouth full of food , If you can get out to grab meat and all that , then why don t you just run away ? 
The clinking of forks from Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped nearly immediately . The constant twinkle in his eyes faded as he bowed his head slowly . 
I tried once he murmured . One time I went out to get meat and I was thinking about all the horrible shit my dad s done and i I made a run for it , I was only gone for a day before he flew out and caught me and he Kirishima ($_kirishima) paused and sniffed , Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt a pang in his ($_bakugou) heart when he ($_bakugou) saw tears drip slowly from kirishima s eyes , he ($_bakugou) did this , Kirishima ($_kirishima) ran his ($_bakugou) finger down the scar that went from his ($_bakugou) shoulder to his ($_bakugou) elbow . 
Shit sorry-I shouldn t have brought it up - 
No no ! said Kirishima ($_kirishima) , It s fine plus , s-scars are manly . It was clear to Bakugou that he ($_bakugou) was just trying to put on a brave face , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) knew of all people that it was a lot harder than it looked . 
Your dad do you talk often ? asked Bakugou ($_bakugou) 
Not much anymore he ($_bakugou) said solemnly , but he ($_bakugou) used to try to fade from dragon to human form he ($_bakugou) had this witch friend who could temporarily transform him ($_bakugou) into a human those were the worst times , he ($_bakugou) d use them to train me but but I was never good enough , he ($_bakugou) d tell me that all the time , told me I was pathetic 
Tears began to drizzle from Kirishima ($_kirishima) s eyes once more . There was something so heartbreaking , about seeing someone who always seemed to be in a constant state of happiness , look so sad and hurt . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was never really good at comforting people , when he ($_bakugou) was 12 a girl lost her ($_bakugou) doll and wouldn t stop crying so he ($_bakugou) screamed at her ($_bakugou) until she ($_bakugou) ran out of tears , but there was something within Bakugou ($_bakugou) that was giving him ($_bakugou) the urge just to try and help this boy . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) had never been one to cry in front of others , he ($_bakugou) thought of it ($_kirishima) to not be very manly . He ($_bakugou) didn t like appearing weak , but he ($_bakugou) just couldn t help it . The memories of his ($_bakugou) father screaming in his ($_bakugou) mind seemed almost too vivid . 
Fucking pathetic Eijirou can t get anything right 
Father ($_father) please please stop 
Stop !? Why on earth would I do that , but I don t know what I ever saw in you , you can t do anything fucking right you piece of fucking shit disgrace to your family name 
Kirishima couldn t stop crying , but the more his fathers metal boot pressed down on his face , the more tears just seemed to be squeezed out . 
P-please stop 
You need to learn 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) let out a cry of fear as his_father ($_father) grabbed him by the collar and held him over the edge of the mountain , his feet floating in the air . Kirishima couldn t stop screaming , he felt as if he were going to be dropped any moment , he felt he was going to pass out . It was as if his heart were in his throat and he was trapped . 
His fathers hands suddenly began to glow red , small scales began flipping up onto his skin . 
Fucking lucky growled his_father ($_father) as he threw him back into the mountain , away from the ledge . He stormed away into his chambers before letting out a blood curdling growl . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) curled up in a ball and cried he felt pathetic , he felt as if he knew he was pathetic . He was like that the entire night , until there were no tears left 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt the same way he did when he was on the edge of the mountain , and this simply the memories of the event . He couldn t stop crying . He was a blubbering mess . He felt as if nothing could save him - 
Warm arms wrapped around him . Kirishima crying halted for a second when he felt Bakugou ($_bakugou) pull him into a warm , soft hug . He patted Kirishima on the back gently , letting him cry into his shoulder . Kirishima ($_kirishima) had never felt this way before , but the softness of Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt special . He let it ($_kirishima) be , knowing not to say any words . 
You know whispered Bakugou ($_bakugou) , We could run away 
W-what stammered Kirishima ($_kirishima) 
We could run away and make sure your_father ($_father) never catches us 
How could we do that ? 
We run off the other side of the mountain , he ll be expecting you to go out this way we could do it you know 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped for a moment , thinking about it . Running away with Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Running away from their troubles didn t seem like a very manly thing to do , but for some reason , when he was with Bakugou ($_bakugou) , he felt like he was willing to do anything - 
Sure yeah ! Let s do it ! 
Seeing Kirishima smile again brought about a certain warmth to Bakugou , which he couldn t help but smile at .
