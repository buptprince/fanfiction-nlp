Chapter 6 : The Girl With the Pink Hair 
`` I hate them . '' Toga stomped her ($_dabi) foot with a screech . Dabi ($_dabi) put a hand on her ($_dabi) shoulder and heaved a sigh . 
`` They 're stronger than we expected . And there 's a frog subhuman with them . One of those villagers , too , aided them . '' 
Tomura ($_tomura) scratched the back of his ($_tomura) neck . He ($_tomura) looked from the fuming Toga to the irritated Dabi to the last hooded figure who looked less upset than the other two . He ($_tomura) cocked his ($_tomura) head . 
`` You 've been awfully quiet , Thunder_Mage ($_mage) . '' 
`` I 'm upset , too . They should pay . '' The_mage ($_mage) answered almost automatically . Robotically. Tomura ($_tomura) scratched his ($_tomura) chin . 
"Yes, indeed. Although remember not to-"
"Yes, yes. Do n't kill the prince and whatever . '' Toga mocked . Tomura ($_tomura) glared at the girl who folded her arms with a pout but shut up . 
`` You have one last chance . All three of you . Stop them in the desert , before they have a chance to cross into the Ignis Kingdom , or else I 'm handing the job over to Endeavor . And you three wo n't share in the reward . '' 
`` Boo , that 's not fair ! '' Toga whined . 
`` She was the one who failed the first time ! '' 
`` At least I found them ! If not for me , we would n't know they went into Ranae . '' 
`` If not for you , we would n't have lost soldiers on the border of Ranae because of a subhuman female . '' Dabi ($_dabi) sneered . Tomura ($_tomura) slammed his ($_tomura) hands on the arms of the throne , and the two snapped upright . 
`` Do not fail me . That is all . '' 
`` Tch , let 's go . '' Dabi ($_dabi) turned around , the other two following after him ($_dabi) . Toga skipped , her ($_dabi) small knife swinging in her ($_dabi) hand , while the_mage ($_mage) walked quickly with his ($_mage) hands clutched around his ($_mage) tome . Dabi ($_dabi) glanced at him ($_mage) with a frown . 
"Hey!" 
The_mage ($_mage) looked as if he ($_mage) 'd been electrocuted at the noise . 
"Yes?" 
`` Be ready to use all your ($_denki) power . Something tells me we might need you ($_denki) to unleash your ($_denki) full potential , Denki ($_denki) . '' 
~ X ~ 
The group followed Aoyama ($_aoyama) . He ($_aoyama) stood out among the desert sand with his ($_aoyama) bright white robes and golden hair . As they drew near the cluster of bandits Mandalay mentioned , Bakugou ($_bakugou) noticed they look different from the invaders had . 
They wore long bird like masks that concealed the lower halves of their faces . While they were dressed in black , they did not seem as official as the invaders had . The lot of them were smaller than the armies led by Toga and Dabi ($_dabi) , and they all carried axes . Whoever seemed to be their leader , dressed in black and carrying a sword , was talking with someone else . 
The girl he ($_aoyama) conversed , or rather argued with , had bright pink hair . Her skin , too , was the same pink color . Her black eyes were narrowed , and there was a small girl at her side , arms wrapped around her waist . The pink haired girl had two horns sticking out of her head , and the smaller one only had one . Bakugou ($_bakugou) frowned . Laguz , then ? But he ($_aoyama) 'd never seen any of that sort before . 
`` Let 's get closer to hear what they 're saying . '' Deku ($_deku) whispered , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) already started storming towards the group . Deku ($_deku) groaned , chasing after the prince . 
"Hey! Are you ($_deku) assholes the ones who invaded my kingdom ? '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) yelled at the same time Aoyama ($_aoyama) rushed forward , his ($_bakugou) tome brandished and robes flying around him ($_bakugou) . 
`` You ($_bakugou) evildoers , kidnapping innocent and revered Dragon Laguz ! And taking over kingdoms ! '' He ($_bakugou) proclaimed , pointing at the group . All the bandits growled , reaching for their axes , but the one with the sword held up his ($_bakugou) hand . 
"Now, now. You misunderstand . We never took over any kingdoms . And we have not been kidnapping anyone . If anything , she 's the kidnapper . '' He ($_bakugou) nodded at the pink girl who growled , the noise low and rumbling and way too deep for an average young woman . 
"Lies!" The girl snarled . Her eyes seemed almost feral , and her teeth resembled fangs . 
`` Eri ($_eri) is my ($_eri) daughter , I ($_eri) simply came to save her from this woman who took her and fled to the desert with her . You must have mistaken us for someone else . I ($_eri) am Chisaki ($_chisaki) . And these are my ($_eri) friends . We mean no harm to anyone in these parts . '' As he ($_bakugou) said it , however , his ($_bakugou) gaze was not on them but on the horizon as if searching for something he ($_bakugou) could not see . 
Aoyama ($_aoyama) put his ($_aoyama) hand on his ($_aoyama) hip , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) crossed his ($_aoyama) arms . Aoyama_'s ($_aoyama) tome glowed softly with a white light , but he ($_aoyama) made no move to use it . Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) sword trembled in his ($_bakugou) hands , and he ($_bakugou) looked back and forth from his ($_bakugou) group to Chisaki ($_chisaki) and his ($_bakugou) so called friends , itching for a fight . 
`` If she ($_chisaki) truly is your daughter , I understand your reasoning . '' At this , the pink girl growled and pulled Eri ($_eri) closer to her ($_chisaki) , and Aoyama ($_aoyama) held up his ($_aoyama) hand . `` But , if she ($_chisaki) 's not , then I ($_chisaki) 'm concerned as to why you 're pursuing this young Dragon Laguz girl . I ($_chisaki) also think it 's best to hear the accused kidnapper 's account , as she ($_chisaki) seems bent on protecting not hurting your daughter . '' 
`` She ($_chisaki) wants to steal her ($_chisaki) away from me . '' Chisaki ($_chisaki) stated . His ($_chisaki) face did not change , though his ($_chisaki) eyes narrowed slightly . 
`` Is it really necessary for you to bring all these men to , you know , retrieve your daughter from a young woman ? '' Sero ($_sero) asked gesturing at the group of bandits , a hint of a blush on his ($_sero) face . `` I ($_sero) mean , it 's often better to use words , you know . '' 
Chisaki ($_chisaki) was n't listening , however . His ($_sero) gaze was on Iida and Ochako . He ($_sero) cocked his ($_sero) head . 
`` Armor . That 's a bad choice to wear in a desert . Tell me , what are knights of Fragor ($_fragor) , '' he ($_sero) paused to glance over at Tsuyu , `` and a Amphibian Laguz doing all the way out here . '' 
`` I 'm the Prince of Fragor ($_fragor) . '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) pronounced despite Deku_'s ($_deku) desperate whine of Kacchan . 
Chisaki_'s ($_'s) eyes widened . There was a rumbling noise from the group of bandits . 
`` Change of plans , boys . Capture the prince , I heard there 's a good offer for him from King Endeavor of Ignis . And the Amphibian Laguz . Seeing one of those outside the swamps is rare . Kill the rest . Oh , but leave the white mage alive , I need to find out where that village is . And make sure not to harm Eri ($_eri) or dear Mina . '' 
`` Like hell you 'll take us ! '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) roared . He ($_bakugou) charged at Chisaki ($_chisaki) . The_man_'s ($_bakugou) blade sliced towards Bakugou ($_bakugou) , but he ($_bakugou) was thrown back by a flash of white light . Aoyama_'s ($_aoyama) tome was in his ($_aoyama) hand , and he ($_aoyama) glared at Chisaki , a defiant look in his ($_aoyama) eyes . 
`` Miss , get out of here ! It 's dangerous ! '' Sero ($_sero) cried , rushing over to the pink haired girl and the child . The girl only laughed . 
`` I 'd say it 's more dangerous for you than me , but if you insist , handsome . '' She kissed him ($_bakugou) on the cheek , and Sero ($_sero) flushed . `` Thanks for the help , heroes . '' With that , she cradled Eri ($_eri) in her arms and dashed off away from the fighting . 
Sero ($_sero) spun around and ducked , nearly having his ($_sero) head cut off by an axe . He ($_sero) dashed away from the bandit and whipped an arrow out , firing it and watching as it hit the bandit and fell him ($_sero) . 
Iida , Deku ($_deku) , Ochako ($_ochako) and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) all battled with the bandits . One attempted to throw some strange powder towards Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , and Ochako ($_ochako) swooped down , impaling him ($_sero) with her ($_ochako) spear . 
`` You alright , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) ? '' She ($_ochako) called . The Amphibian Laguz , transformed into her ($_ochako) beast state , struck a bandit down with her ($_ochako) long tongue and nodded . 
`` Thank you ($_ochako) , Ochako ($_ochako) . I ($_ochako) 'm not sure what that was , but if they 're Laguz ($_laguz) kidnappers , I ($_ochako) 'm sure it was an attempt to cancel our powers . '' 
`` Be careful , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) . I 'll be on the look out for any more holding something like that ! '' Ochako ($_ochako) yelled , launching up into the air before plummeting down on more bandits . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was once again thrown back by Chisaki_'s ($_'s) attack . Aoyama ($_aoyama) rushed to his ($_aoyama) side , healing him ($_aoyama) , before aiming a magic attack at Chisaki ($_chisaki) . The_man ($_bakugou) hissed as the white magic engulfed his ($_bakugou) skin and blinded him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) looked around to see his ($_bakugou) group falling left and right , no match for Bakugou_'s ($_bakugou) companions . 
`` This leaves me no choice . '' He ($_bakugou) undid the mask from around his ($_bakugou) face . Bakugou ($_bakugou) rushed at him ($_bakugou) , but Aoyama ($_aoyama) held Bakugou ($_bakugou) back . 
"Wait! Careful , Prince ! '' 
A loud roar sounded . Where Chisaki ($_chisaki) stood a black flame flared up , and out of it , rose a huge black dragon . Its gleaming black eyes stared at Bakugou and Aoyama ($_aoyama) with a mix of anger and malice . It grinned revealing sharp rows of white teeth . 
`` A Dragon Laguz . Transformed. It 's beautiful . '' Aoyama ($_aoyama) breathed . The boy 's eyes filled with wonder and awe at the majestic sight of the beast . Bakugou ($_bakugou) curled his ($_bakugou) hand around his ($_bakugou) sword . 
`` You ($_bakugou) find that beautiful ? '' He ($_bakugou) scoffed . Aoyama ($_aoyama) shrugged . 
"Indeed. Aside from the fact he ($_bakugou) most likely wants to kill us right now . '' Aoyama ($_aoyama) whispered back . 
`` Heh , I knew I could n't rely on those human ruffians for help . Trafficking subhumans was fun , and profitable . And having a group made it much easier . But ah well. I 'll be just fine on my own . I 've got a steady business , and the money I 'll earn from you , '' he ($_bakugou) poked Bakugou ($_bakugou) with his ($_bakugou) claw causing the prince to shudder , `` and of course the profit from that cute little `` Laguz and Human living in harmony '' village . '' 
`` I ($_bakugou) do n't care what you are , you 're going down ! '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouted . Chisaki ($_chisaki) snorted , smoke rising from his ($_chisaki) nostrils . He ($_chisaki) reached for Bakugou ($_bakugou) with his ($_chisaki) clawed hand when something struck his ($_chisaki) arm . 
The arrow embedded itself in between the flesh of the scales . Chisaki ($_chisaki) appeared unharmed by the attack and plucked the arrow out . He ($_chisaki) turned on Sero ($_sero) , snapping his ($_chisaki) jaws , when Ochako ($_ochako) swooped down and snatched Sero ($_sero) up . The boy wrapped his arms around her ($_ochako) waist , and she ($_ochako) set him down next to Bakugou and Aoyama ($_aoyama) . Chisaki ($_chisaki) growled and swatted at Ochako ($_ochako) as she ($_ochako) swerved around his ($_chisaki) head . She ($_ochako) kept dashing in close to try and land a blow , but he ($_chisaki) 'd snap at her ($_ochako) causing her ($_ochako) to swerve upward to avoid being crushed . 
Chisaki ($_chisaki) breathed a plume of black flames . Ochako ($_ochako) shrieked and just barely swerved out of the way . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) leapt on top of him ($_tsuyu) . Chisaki ($_chisaki) tried to shake her ($_ochako) off , but the Laguz ($_laguz) girl had latched on to him ($_tsuyu) . He ($_chisaki) roared , thrashing , unable to rid himself ($_chisaki) of the leech . 
`` I ca n't get close enough to land a blow . '' Iida ($_iida) stated , biting his ($_iida) lip and rejoining the group , his ($_iida) spear trembling in his ($_iida) hands . Ochako ($_ochako) still flitted around Chisaki ($_chisaki) , but could n't get close enough to attack , and even if she ($_ochako) was able to , Bakugou ($_bakugou) doubted her ($_ochako) spear would make an impact . Sero_'s ($_sero) bow was still drawn , but he ($_bakugou) looked on helpless , and Deku reappeared close to the rest of them , biting his ($_bakugou) lip and his ($_bakugou) daggers drawn . 
There was a crash as Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) was thrown . Chisaki ($_chisaki) rounded on them and roared , spraying spit . Aoyama ($_aoyama) reacted with an attack . The bright light seared Chisaki and caused his ($_bakugou) scales to burn . He ($_bakugou) reared up , scratching at them and shaking his ($_bakugou) head to rid himself ($_bakugou) of his ($_bakugou) blindness before planting his ($_bakugou) feet firmly on the ground . His ($_bakugou) eyes flared with unbridled rage , and when he ($_bakugou) spoke , his ($_bakugou) voice was a snarl . 
`` I should just kill all of you for the annoyance you 've caused ! '' 
Ochako ($_ochako) swooped down on him ($_bakugou) , and he ($_bakugou) opened his ($_bakugou) mouth , fire building up inside it . Something bright flashed and tackled Ochako ($_ochako) out of the sky . She ($_gravita) screamed and raised her ($_gravita) spear , but before she ($_gravita) could attack , she ($_gravita) found herself ($_gravita) falling into someone 's arms . Gravita ($_gravita) set down next to her ($_gravita) , unharmed if not startled . 
`` Sorry about that ! '' A cheerful girl 's voice laughed . Ochako ($_ochako) blushed as the pink skinned Laguz girl set her ($_gravita) down . The girl 's smile faded as she ($_gravita) turned her ($_gravita) eyes on Chisaki ($_chisaki) . In a bright pink flash of light , she ($_gravita) 'd transformed into a beautiful dragon with wings and vibrant pink scales . Her ($_gravita) tail swished as she ($_gravita) charged at Chisaki ($_chisaki) . 
`` A Manakete ! '' Aoyama ($_aoyama) gasped , awestruck . Bakugou ($_bakugou) glared at him ($_aoyama) . 
`` A what ? '' 
`` A kind of Dragon Laguz . '' Iida ($_iida) explained . `` One that I ($_iida) did not think existed . '' 
The_Manakete ($_the) attacked Chisaki ($_chisaki) . She ($_the) was smaller than him ($_aoyama) , but she ($_the) could fly and was faster . She ($_the) swooped down towards him ($_aoyama) , raking her ($_the) claws along his ($_aoyama) skin and ripping up his ($_aoyama) scales . He ($_aoyama) roared , breathing flames at her ($_the) . 
She ($_the) ducked and dodged the attacks . Once the flames stopped , she ($_the) hovered mid-air and retaliated with her ($_the) own . Pink flames set his ($_aoyama) body on fire causing him ($_aoyama) to roar and writhe . 
She ($_the) alighted down before them with a huff . Her ($_the) wings folded at her ($_the) sides and when he ($_aoyama) tried to charge at her ($_the) , she ($_the) spread her ($_the) wings and breathed another plume of flames . He ($_aoyama) shrieked as the flames melted his ($_aoyama) body and caused him ($_aoyama) to revert back to his ($_aoyama) humanoid form . He ($_aoyama) panted , glaring at her ($_the) . 
She ($_the) stalked towards him ($_aoyama) , her ($_the) black eyes narrowed . Her ($_the) wings unfurled , and her ($_the) tail swished as she ($_the) circled him ($_aoyama) like a predator before killing its prey . 
`` You ($_the) 're going to release all the Laguz you ($_the) ever captured and sold . And you ($_the) 're going to leave both Eri ($_eri) and me , and the_whole_village_of_Mirage ($_the) Mirage ($_mirage) , alone . '' 
He ($_aoyama) laughed , a bitter and dry sound . 
`` Even if I wanted to , that 's impossible . They 're far gone now . I 'm sure most are dead . To be a Laguz in this world , it 's a curse . You 've got ta blend in , become like the humans are even if it means betraying you 're own kind . Foolish humans like you , I despise . '' He ($_aoyama) growled with a piercing glare towards Aoyama ($_aoyama) . 
`` The_Village_of_Mirage ($_the) Mirage ($_mirage) proves we can co exist ! '' Aoyama ($_aoyama) protested . His ($_aoyama) tome shook in his ($_aoyama) hand . 
`` The_village ($_the) is home to idiots and weaklings . And you ca n't protect it ($_the) forever . More like me exist . '' He ($_aoyama) chuckled , his ($_aoyama) voice low . `` If I was n't the one to find and destroy it , others will come , and they 'll - '' 
The_Manakete ($_the) snapped him ($_aoyama) up in her jaws . His ($_aoyama) body crunched underneath her sharp teeth , and she spat him ($_aoyama) out . Her tail lashed . A light surrounded her as she transformed . She ran past them towards Eri ($_eri) and gathered the girl in her arms . 
`` Eri ($_eri) ! '' The pink haired girl cheered before turning towards the rest of them and setting the small one horned girl down . 
`` Is she alright ? '' Iida ($_iida) asked . He ($_iida) started towards Eri who shrunk away . The pink haired girl patted Eri 's back giving her a small smile . 
`` It 's alright , Eri ($_eri) . They helped me defeat them . '' 
`` Thank you ($_eri) . '' Eri ($_eri) whispered with a nod at all of them . She still clutched the Manakete girl , but a small smile slowly crept on her face . 
`` You ($_eri) 're amazing ! '' Gushed Ochako , and the Manakete girl laughed . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) nodded at Ochako_'s ($_ochako) statement as well , having transformed back into her ($_ochako) humanoid state after Chisaki_'s ($_'s) defeat . She ($_ochako) looked a bit banged up , sand mixed in her ($_ochako) long hair , but overall she ($_ochako) appeared to be alright . 
`` You ($_ochako) really are . '' Sero ($_sero) breathed . A mix of fear and admiration danced in his eyes . The girl laughed . 
`` My ($_sero) name 's Mina Ashido . That man , '' she ($_ochako) said with a glare at Chisaki_'s ($_'s) broken body , `` was chasing me ($_sero) and captured me ($_sero) . I ($_sero) escaped with this girl he claimed to be his daughter . '' She ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) head . `` I ($_sero) should travel on , but Eri ($_eri) ... '' She ($_ochako) trailed off with a glance at the small girl who shuffled her ($_ochako) feet . 
`` Fear not , fair Mina ! '' Aoyama ($_aoyama) knelt down and kissed her ($_ochako) hand . Mina ($_mina) tilted her ($_ochako) head , confused . `` Mirage ($_mirage) would be happy to care for Eri ($_eri) . I know four friends ; Mandalay , Ryuuko , Ragdoll and Tiger , who would love to raise a child together . '' 
`` That 'd be fantastic ! What do you ($_ochako) say , Eri ($_eri) ? '' Mina ($_mina) asked with a warm smile . Eri ($_eri) nodded , tugging on a strand of her ($_mina) hair . Aoyama ($_aoyama) extended a hand to Eri , and she ($_mina) took it . He ($_aoyama) looked over at the group with a smile on his ($_aoyama) face . 
`` I ($_aoyama) suppose this is farewell , then . Adieu . Your help was most appreciated . '' 
`` No trouble at all , after the hospitality you showed us . '' Iida ($_iida) smiled back . 
`` Where do you ($_iida) plan to go , Mina ($_mina) ? '' Ochako ($_ochako) asked . Mina ($_mina) tapped her ($_mina) chin . 
`` I ($_mina) just like to travel around ! '' She ($_mina) laughed . She ($_mina) was about to leave when a thunder bolt rained down freezing her ($_mina) in her ($_mina) tracks . Aoyama ($_aoyama) clutched Eri ($_eri) and fled back towards the rest of them gritting his ($_aoyama) teeth . 
`` More of his ($_aoyama) friends , do you ($_eri) suppose ? '' He ($_aoyama) asked . Iida ($_iida) shook his ($_iida) head , his ($_iida) eyes wide . 
`` No . They 're back . ''
