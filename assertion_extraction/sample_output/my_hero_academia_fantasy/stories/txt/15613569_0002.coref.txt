Bakugou ($_bakugou) was still trying to get a grasp on exactly where he ($_bakugou) was , he ($_bakugou) knew he ($_bakugou) was somewhere at least . But all he ($_bakugou) could remember was fighting with his ($_bakugou) mother before he ($_bakugou) could feel himself ($_bakugou) whisking away somewhere , and now he ($_bakugou) s woken up in some rock cage with some overly-cheerful redheaded boy trying to make conversation with him ($_bakugou) . 
Tell me , where the fuck am I 
Kirishimas face dropped for a second , the sparkle in his ($_bakugou) eyes flickered for a split second , before he ($_bakugou) leaned over closer to the bars and whispered 
Are you allowed to say that word ? 
what word 
The f word 
Fuck ? 
Yeah???
Bakugou ($_bakugou) could barely believe what he ($_bakugou) was hearing . Was this boy like mentally 2 years old ? Had he ($_bakugou) never been allowed to swear in his ($_bakugou) life ? Why the hell is he ($_bakugou) talking like this . 
I ve always said it 
Father ($_father) won t let me say it 
Whos your_father ($_father) 
he ($_bakugou) s out 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s heart froze for a second . He ($_bakugou) could feel himself ($_bakugou) remembering . He ($_bakugou) remembered seeing the giant dragon soar from the sky and pluck him ($_bakugou) from the ground . He ($_bakugou) could hear his ($_bakugou) screams of terror being overshadowed by the sheer power of the dragons wings . 
I-is your_father ($_father) the - 
- Dragon ? Yeah he ($_bakugou) sure is ! 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) quickly retreated back to the corner of his ($_bakugou) cell , before quickly arching up and holding out his ($_bakugou) hands , ready to set off an explosion that could destroy this kid . 
Why are you so scared ? asked Kirishima ($_kirishima) , as he ($_bakugou) tilted his ($_bakugou) head slightly . 
I m not fucking scared 
sure???
I SAID I M NOT FUCKING SCARED SHITTY HAIR ! 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) let out a quick giggle , before crossing his legs and sticking his arms in between the crossed legs to support himself . While he did this , Bakugou ($_bakugou) caught a glance of some burns on his arm , and a long scratch scar down from his shoulder to his elbow . 
If he s your father , then why aren t you a dragon ? 
Well I m not completely dragon 
The fuck you mean 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly stood up and glanced down at his ($_kirishima) hands , before furrowing his ($_kirishima) brow and muttering to Bakugou . 
I can turn into a dragon at will 
Now Bakugou ($_bakugou) was the interested one . He ($_bakugou) was inching himself ($_bakugou) closer and closer towards the bars , before he ($_bakugou) wrapped his ($_bakugou) fingers around the bar and tilted his ($_bakugou) head slightly in curiosity . The fur of his ($_bakugou) cape brushed against his ($_bakugou) ears made him ($_bakugou) quickly shiver , which caused Kirishima ($_kirishima) to giggle . 
Whenever I think about it hard enough , or will it to happen , it just happens but it s kinda hard to control , sometimes I can be stuck as a dragon for a while , sometimes I keep turning back human_Kirishima ($_human) rubbed the back of his ($_human) head before turning away as his ($_human) face went red . Dad ($_dad) says it s pretty pathetic 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt a pang in his ($_bakugou) heart . He ($_bakugou) didn t know why , he ($_bakugou) never really felt stuff , especially to near strangers . But something about the feeling of being pathetic resonated to the aggressive teen . Something about the way Kirishima ($_kirishima) was acting seemed to remind Bakugou of himself ($_human) , even though he ($_human) hated to admit it . 
Your_dad ($_dad) sounds like a bit of a dickhead 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly yelped before turning to Bakugou and giggling . 
No no no he ($_human) s he ($_human) s just trying to toughen me up that s all yeah 
Well that s not how you fucking do it 
Hm ? 
you cant get better at your powers if you aren t practicing at it 
Dad ($_dad) says there s no bother in trying 
I could train you ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt his ($_bakugou) cheeks flare up quickly . He ($_bakugou) had no clue why the fuck this boy was making him ($_bakugou) feel like this , he ($_bakugou) had only just met him ($_bakugou) ! But there was just something about him ($_bakugou) that made Bakugou ($_bakugou) want to help him ($_bakugou) . Something about him ($_bakugou) that made him ($_bakugou) want to get closer to him ($_bakugou) . 
Fucking cool it Bakugou ! You sound like a pussy 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s head tilted slightly again at the offer . Before turning back to look outside the huge gaping hole in the cave that led to the outside . He rubbed the side of his arm out of anxiety . Bakugou ($_bakugou) watched his ($_bakugou) fingers trace up and down the scar across his ($_bakugou) arm . 
As much as I would love it father would never let you out 
He doesn t have to know 
We can train in here ? 
it s too noisy 
Well are there any other places in this fucking mountain ? 
Why the fuck are you acting so insistent !? 
Well Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly turned back to the blonde haired boy , There is a large ledge nearly at the top of the mountain , we could climb there but I would have to be really careful about letting you out 
Suddenly , before the two could talk anymore , it felt like the mountain was being shaken . At first Bakugou ($_bakugou) believed it to be an earthquake , before it was followed by a blood curdling roar , and the sound of wings ripping through the air like tearing flesh . Bakugou ($_bakugou) saw Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly recoil and back away from the cage , before running over to a large wooden door at the back of the room . 
The fuck is that !? yelled Bakugou ($_bakugou) 
Fathers home 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s heart skipped a beat when he ($_bakugou) heard the words . Bakugou hadn t even gotten a good look at the beast itself and he ($_bakugou) could already feel the fear it could strike into him ($_bakugou) . 
I ve got to quickly talk to him ($_bakugou) give him ($_bakugou) a rundown on how you ($_bakugou) are I suggest you ($_bakugou) cover your ($_bakugou) ears 
Why the fuck would I do that ? 
he ($_bakugou) s loud 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly whipped open the seemingly heavy door with ease . Bakugou ($_bakugou) tried to get a glimpse at the_dragon ($_the) , but he ($_bakugou) saw nothing . All he ($_bakugou) could see was an extraordinarily large room with several pillars that seemed to stretch out for miles . He ($_bakugou) watched in wonder as he ($_bakugou) saw several torches in the room light up quickly , before the door was closed and Kirishima ($_kirishima) was out of sight . 
And into the belly of the beast . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly shut the door behind him ($_bakugou) and rested his ($_bakugou) knuckles against the hard wood of the door frame , before taking a deep breath and turning around to face his ($_bakugou) father . 
How is he boy ? hissed the_dragon ($_the) , his ($_bakugou) voice alone could rip the bravest soldiers alone to shreds . There was something so evil , so horrifying , so blood curdling in the beast s voice . 
He ($_bakugou) s doing well ! He ($_bakugou) just woke up 
You sound overly chipper the thing should be injured 
Oh , I tended to most of his ($_bakugou) wounds but - 
SILENCE 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly recoiled in fear . His ($_bakugou) father didn t even move , just his ($_bakugou) sudden yell was enough to make him ($_bakugou) back away . He ($_bakugou) could feel a few tears welling up in his ($_bakugou) eyes , before he ($_bakugou) quickly wiped them away with his ($_bakugou) wrists , trying his ($_bakugou) best to look as brave as possible 
What did I tell you about helping prisoners ! That boy is the offspring of our mortal enemy ! 
Yes but he ($_bakugou) s young well not to me but he ($_bakugou) seems different to the others - 
NONE OF THOSE CREATURES ARE DIFFERENT ! 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) could feel his ($_eijirou) knees getting weaker . His ($_eijirou) will to hold back the tears already welling in his ($_eijirou) eyes was slowly fading . 
How dare you even think that something out of that tribe could be different you re a disgrace to this name get out of my sight , I don t want to see you for days I m going to sleep for a while get out you waste of life 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) wasted no time getting out of his ($_kirishima) father s chambers . He ($_kirishima) stumbled over himself ($_kirishima) as he ($_kirishima) exited his ($_kirishima) father s chambers , tears were running off his ($_kirishima) face like rain as he ($_kirishima) quickly opened the door to the prison room and slammed it behind him ($_kirishima) , before he ($_kirishima) wiped off his ($_kirishima) face and walked over to bakugou , who was fiddling with rocks in his ($_kirishima) cell . 
I-I m going to bed muttered Kirishima ($_kirishima) 
Oh-umm , okay see you tomorrow then 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly walked over to the corner of the room and pulled out a large rock , which revealed an enormous bed behind it , with some kind of leopard skin covers . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was confused as all hell . 
Kirish-I mean-shitty hair 
Yeah???
What fucking room is this ? Is it not the dungeon ? 
Nah , it s my bedroom 
WHAT???
Night 
Before Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt the effort to scream anything else , Kirishima ($_kirishima) gave him ($_bakugou) a quick smile which shut him ($_bakugou) up , before Kirishima ($_kirishima) blew out the torch above his ($_bakugou) bed with the snap of a finger , letting darkness consume the mountain .
