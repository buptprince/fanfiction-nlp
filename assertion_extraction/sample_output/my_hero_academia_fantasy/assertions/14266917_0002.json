You could say I was running late , but it was not quite . I was always where I needed to be at the time I needed to be , but this one just seemed like a little pointless detour . \n", "Mommy , he called . Despite how serious I took my job , taking away a mother from her ($_inko) child was always when I hesitated the most . \n", "Out of the pity of my heart , I let Inko ($_inko) caress her ($_inko) child s cheeks with her ($_inko) soul . Since that was all there was left of her ($_inko) . \n"], "($_hizashi)": ["And Hizashi ($_hizashi) was about to give him ($_izuku) away . \n", "I think he ($_izuku) likes you , Hizashi ($_hizashi) joked , moving his ($_hizashi) body so his ($_hizashi) lover had better access to the baby . \n", "But when his ($_hizashi) eyes landed on Izuku ($_izuku) once again , he ($_hizashi) couldn t hide his ($_hizashi) own smile . Izuku ($_izuku) reached out for his ($_izuku) thumb with a tiny hand . He ($_izuku) tugged at it , softly and with no strength . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) was calm in Hizashi ($_hizashi) s arms . He ($_izuku) rubbed his ($_izuku) small head on his ($_izuku) clothes , yawning as he ($_izuku) babbled . It tugged at Hizashi ($_hizashi) s heart , to see such a small thing that had done anything wrong . So weak and so innocent , staring into Hizashi s eyes with absolute trust . \n", "And Hizashi ($_hizashi) , she said , turning around to re-enter her house . Don ($_don) t go wasting you ($_don) thanks to useless gods ! \n", "His ($_hizashi) name is Izuku ($_izuku) , Aizawa ($_aizawa) answered for both of them . Hizashi ($_hizashi) was too grateful to be able to mutter something other than thank you '' . Midnight nodded . \n", "Thank god , Hizashi ($_hizashi) managed to sigh . \n", "Thank you , Hizashi ($_hizashi) breathed out . Tears welled up in his ($_hizashi) eyes , as he ($_hizashi) handed her Izuku . \n", "Ten , she said instead . Hizashi ($_hizashi) looked up with stars in his ($_hizashi) eyes . It s the most I can maintain him ($_hizashi) . Consider it a favor , for a long-time friend . \n", "But they both knew those things . There was no point in reminding Hizashi ($_hizashi) that the fate which awaited the child was worse than death . \n", "He ($_hizashi) will be alive with her , Aizawa ($_aizawa) made sure to mark the emphasis on the word alive . It s not the same thing . \n", "Yeah , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said with a sigh . He ($_hizashi) knew . That didn t prevent him ($_hizashi) from dreaming . He ($_hizashi) s going to be better off with Midnight . \n", "Aizawa ($_aizawa) had the words on the tip of his ($_aizawa) mouth . The words to tell Hizashi ($_hizashi) depends who you ask . Or perhaps, ???is better to be dead and free, than alive and trapped. \n", " Alive is better than death , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said . Izuku ($_izuku) began sobbing in his ($_izuku) arms .", " The little thing was hungry . Hizashi ($_hizashi) wished there was a way for him ($_izuku) to feed him ($_izuku) . But all they had were dried food . They lasted longer that way .", "It wasn t a dream that was possible , but the fantasy of saving the child was enough to give Hizashi ($_hizashi) his ($_hizashi) own breath back . It was enough to let him ($_hizashi) stand up and make up his ($_hizashi) mind . \n", " You heard that , little guy ? Hizashi ($_hizashi) cooed at Izuku , who was peacefully dreaming in Aizawa ($_aizawa) s arms . It was a lovely image . If fate hadn t placed them in such an awful position , he would have loved to have a baby too . We ll save you .", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew it was a lie . There was no way they could save up enough money to buy him back . But it was a wishful thinking . They had , after all , some years to save up . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) nodded , ever so slightly , as he ($_hizashi) got up . Aizawa ($_aizawa) walked towards him ($_hizashi) , offering his ($_hizashi) hand to help his ($_hizashi) lover get up . They both stared at Midnight , who smiled widely towards the pair of men . \n", "We could keep him ($_hizashi) , Hizashi ($_hizashi) suggested . \n", "He ($_hizashi) could also die , Aizawa ($_aizawa) interjected . The blankets were wrapped around his ($_hizashi) body , twisting when he ($_hizashi) moved . It s early winter , and we barely managed to keep him ($_hizashi) warm . Not to mention milk - . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) was handed Izuku ($_izuku) by Aizawa ($_aizawa) once they woke up . They were sitting on the bed , the coldness of early winter still fresh in their windows . Aizawa ($_aizawa) looked over Hizashi ($_hizashi) s shoulder , as the man cradled the boy in his arms . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew . Unfortunately , it was already too late for those kinds of warnings . His ($_hizashi) heart had already warmed up to the little baby , who sucked on his ($_hizashi) thumb like it were a bottle . \n", "But that was something he ($_hizashi) needn t say to Aizawa . Probably because his ($_hizashi) lover already knew . \n", "Hizashi_Yamada ($_hizashi) , he ($_hizashi) introduced himself ($_hizashi) with a smile . And who is that_little_guy_over_there ($_hizashi) ? \n", "He ($_hizashi) s pretty cute , Hizashi ($_hizashi) commented . He ($_hizashi) takes it from you ! \n", " After a long journey , Hizashi ($_hizashi) arrived at the capital of Ignis ($_ignis) . He ($_hizashi) had buried Inko ($_inko) near the border , where the snow had mostly melted down . There was a hidden longing inside of him ($_hizashi) , to tell someone what had happened . But he ($_hizashi) couldn t bring himself ($_hizashi) to do so . People at the palace were scary . If Hizashi ($_hizashi) gave them a reason , without a doubt he ($_hizashi) would be hanged .", "So , instead , he ($_hizashi) reached the capital with a baby in hands . \n", "What s that ? his ($_hizashi) lover asked when Hizashi ($_hizashi) reached home . \n", "A baby , he ($_hizashi) simply answered . A woman gave it to me . \n", "I know , Hizashi ($_hizashi) replied . He ($_aizawa) looked at the small baby in his ($_aizawa) arms , and guilt swallowed him ($_aizawa) . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) bit his ($_hizashi) lip , feeling guilt swallow him ($_hizashi) up . Izuku ($_izuku) cried in his ($_izuku) arms , making Midnight look over to the kid . He ($_izuku) dropped to his ($_izuku) knees , stretching out his ($_izuku) arms to show the little kid . \n", "Oh , Hizashi ($_hizashi) , Midnight called , as she walked away from her house . It was small . Really small. It was barely enough for one person , but that was the only way she could survive . What brings you here ? \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) got out of the carriage with sluggish movements . He ($_hizashi) still didn t want to do this . He ($_hizashi) hated the idea of doing this . \n", "Not pay , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said quickly . Midnight ($_midnight) raised an eyebrow at the disgusted tone of Hizashi ($_hizashi) s voice . What? Wasn t he always selling her ($_nemuri) people ? But well , those were adults , she ($_nemuri) guessed . We just want him ($_aizawa) to survive . \n", "Twelve ! Hizashi ($_hizashi) yelled . Sell him ($_aizawa) by twelve ! I ll pay you ! \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) couldn t come up with a good answer . He simply stayed quiet , looking at the floor . Midnight ($_midnight) sighed . \n", "It s so small , Hizashi ($_hizashi) murmured . I don t think I ve held something so small , ever . \n", "He ($_aizawa) is , Hizashi ($_hizashi) said . A fate worse than the one of a corpse . At least , unless they managed to pay for him ($_aizawa) . Trying to wave away the shock in his ($_aizawa) system , Hizashi ($_hizashi) repeated his ($_aizawa) words , he ($_aizawa) is . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) continued his ($_hizashi) travel across the border , his ($_hizashi) silent tears the only warmth left in the place . The child would live enough to reach the_Kingdom_of_Ignis ($_the) Ignis ($_ignis) , sealing the fate of its ($_the) people . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew it . \n", "There s no way for us to feed him ($_aizawa) , Aizawa ($_aizawa) said again . There was a little less compassion in his ($_aizawa) voice , but Hizashi ($_hizashi) knew it was not out of lack of empathy . On the contrary . Too much empathy was perhaps his ($_aizawa) lover s biggest quality . \n", "Hizashi ($_hizashi) stared at Aizawa ($_aizawa) in the eyes . He ($_hizashi) was scared , and Aizawa ($_aizawa) could see so . It wasn t an easy choice , they both knew that . Aizawa ($_aizawa) took the baby from Hizashi ($_hizashi) s arms , as the man he ($_aizawa) had fallen in love with trembled in anguish . \n"]}
