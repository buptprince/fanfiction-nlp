But we will find out how this happened . One of our eggs was stolen before , and we were quick to bring it home . This shall be no different . \n", "The guardian s words quickly calmed the frazzled drakes . Katsuki ($_katsuki) noticed a few still sending looks his ($_katsuki) direction , and a few even seemed to look at Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) , but he ($_katsuki) felt better with Akari ($_akari) s words . She was easily the dragon he ($_katsuki) looked up to most , right after his ($_katsuki) Lord . \n", "Our Lord is in agreement , Akari ($_akari) said . We will find this human and bring our own home . \n", " Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) sent a wave a calm towards him ($_katsuki) likely to calm his ($_katsuki) sudden spike of anger but he ($_katsuki) could still feel traces of her ($_mitsuru) own uneasiness pushing at his ($_katsuki) mind . I do as well , but the elders will have it handled . You heard Akari ($_akari) . They had an egg stolen once before and they brought it back . This will be no different .", "Suddenly the drakes moved out of the way as the Guardian Akari approached the fallen drake . The elder looked down at Riko , her ($_haruka) eyes filled with a deep sadness . Akari ($_akari) let out a gentle coo as she ($_haruka) began dragging her ($_haruka) long tail along Riko ($_riko) s scales in an attempt to comfort her ($_haruka) . \n", "Perhaps you should speak to the guardian Akari_about_it ($_akari) ? Mitsuru ($_mitsuru) voiced in his ($_mitsuru) head , cutting through his ($_mitsuru) thoughts . She ($_mitsuru) is very knowledgeable about the world , so it s likely she ($_mitsuru) will know of what happened to you . \n"], "($_shuzenji)": [" No . Such a thing isn t possible . The only humans ever known to be capable of reading it were the legendary dragon riders , men who could tame the beasts . But they are long gone now , faded into mere stories . Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) s stare bore into him ($_izuku) . Why do you ($_izuku) ask Izuku ($_izuku) ?", "Izuku ($_izuku) felt awful for lying , and he ($_izuku) knew Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) could tell he ($_izuku) was lying through his ($_izuku) teeth . He ($_izuku) could feel her disappointed gaze , but he ($_izuku) couldn t find it in himself ($_izuku) to tell her the truth . \n", "He ($_izuku) shook his ($_izuku) head . Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) had been merely disappointed , but that wasn t enough to make her hate him ($_izuku) was it ? Thinking the kind , old librarian would turn on him ($_izuku) so quickly was ridiculous . He ($_izuku) would just have to properly apologize to her later . \n", "Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) turned , meeting nervous green eyes . Yes Izuku? \n", "He ($_izuku) was thankful his ($_izuku) mother was oblivious to the teasing the people his ($_izuku) age especially liked to inflict on him ($_izuku) , but sometimes he ($_izuku) wished there was someone on his ($_izuku) side . He ($_izuku) thought Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) likely knew about it ($_shuzenji) , if the sympathetic looks and allowing him ($_izuku) special privileges was any indication , but he ($_izuku) didn t want to trouble the elderly woman with his ($_izuku) problems . She was respected by everyone in the village , and Izuku ($_izuku) wouldn t be able to deal with any ire directed towards her because of him ($_izuku) . \n", "Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) immediately looked up from the papers on her desk as he ($_izuku) walked in . The silver quill stopped its movement . Her lips turned downwards into a frown , likely seeing the troubled expression on his ($_izuku) face . \n", "Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) gave him a knowing look . It is alright to hide the truth if you must , but trying to cover it with lies will only cause you pain . She laid a hand on his shoulder . Take this advice from an old woman . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) jumped with a startled squeak , nearly falling out of the chair . He ($_izuku) whirled his ($_izuku) wide eyes towards Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) . The old woman smiled at him ($_izuku) , amusement clear on her face . Izuku ($_izuku) felt his ($_izuku) cheeks flush . \n", "A-ah , Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) , you startled me , he ($_izuku) stammered . \n", "One part of the book in his ($_izuku) language included a list of three items . Two were plants , making it likely to be part of a recipe . Izuku ($_izuku) knew the basic plants around the kingdom , more of those around his ($_izuku) village than anything , but he ($_izuku) was no specialist . Thankfully , the library had a rich section of all sorts of information pertaining to plants . Most focused on medicinal properties a topic he ($_izuku) d noticed Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) seemed particularly interested in but he ($_izuku) wasn t sure if the list was for medicinal purposes or not . \n", "Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) turned back to her papers , a letter it ($_shuzenji) looked like from what he ($_izuku) could see , allowing Izuku ($_izuku) a slight reprieve .

He ($_izuku) heard Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) quickly shuffling over to him ($_izuku) , saying something in her gentle tone , but his ($_izuku) attention was brought to the book splayed out in front of him ($_izuku) . \n", "Shuzenji ($_shuzenji) would probably know . \n"], "($_claw)": ["She raised a brow . Dragon ($_dragon) s Claw ($_claw) ? \n", "I Izuku bit his lip . The woman stood , waiting patiently .
