Izuku ($_izuku) saw the small legion come into view in a field , so he ($_izuku) quickly turned his ($_izuku) horse to shield him ($_izuku) in the woods nearby . He ($_izuku) dismounted and gave the reins to Tokoyami , telling him ($_izuku) to tie the horses here so they can get closer . Izuku ($_izuku) carried the sword with him ($_izuku) , wishing he ($_izuku) had a holster on his ($_izuku) belt for it as Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) does . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) reminded Izuku ($_izuku) to watch where he ($_izuku) steps to be as quiet as possible .

Izuku ($_izuku) watched the_soldier ($_izuku) unwrap a sword , which he ($_izuku) assumes must be the champion 's sword . \n", " I don t think Lord_Enji_Todoroki ($_todoroki) wants to give Kacchan a gift . Izuku ($_izuku) knew there was something wrong with the situation before him ($_izuku) .", " The strange transportation of the sword , the confidence of the champion , the other soldier s fear of wielding it , and the small number of men . The idea of a gift baffled him . There must be something else to it . Izuku ($_izuku) can feel the unease growing like a weed in his ($_izuku) chest . Something is wrong .", "Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) agreed with him ($_izuku) . It is rather strange . A champion usually has a squire or a page boy to bring them their swords , and the weapons are never wrapped like that unless they presented as a gift . \n", " Izuku ($_izuku) was startled when the blades suddenly clashed . He ($_izuku) watched Bakugo ($_bakugo) fight for the first time , using powerful swings with a curved sword . Sparks flew as the metal surfaces hit one another . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s forceful swings had the champion regularly back stepping to avoid the vicious blows . Izuku ($_izuku) swallowed the lump in his ($_izuku) throat .", " He ($_izuku) was starting to become a little excited by the sight of his ($_izuku) mated husband fighting so vigorously . Izuku ($_izuku) let out a gasp when the champion s blade met with Bakugo ($_bakugo) s bicep . From what he ($_izuku) could observe , the sword did little harm and Bakugo ($_bakugo) didn t even feel the cut . His ($_izuku) mate kept on swinging and swinging .", "You re muttering too loud , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) whispered to him ($_izuku) . \n", "He ($_izuku) s slowing down , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) noticed .

Bakugo ($_bakugo) s sword swings were becoming sloppy . And then , the answer hit him ($_izuku) .", " Izuku ($_izuku) gasped , realizing that the feeling of dread he ($_izuku) has is no mistake . It s poisoned ! He ($_izuku) said to Tokoyami . That_blade ($_that) the champion is using ! That s why it was wrapped up ! That s why they were cautious ! And Kacchan ($_kacchan) got nicked by the_blade ($_that) !", " Izuku didn t expect the other alpha to grip his chin and press their lips together in a kiss . His eyes widened in shock . Completely frozen in place , Izuku ($_izuku) didn t know how he should respond . Not even Kacchan ($_kacchan) has kissed him . His first kiss , taken by an alpha that is not his husband or a lover .", " The kiss wasn t anything deep or passionate , but it s still a kiss - and a forbidden one . It lit a small fire of excitement in his lower belly , but he couldn t let it become anything more than that . Izuku ($_izuku) pushed himself away .", " I can only be as obedient as my conscience will let me , Izuku ($_izuku) answered , putting on his ($_izuku) gloves . Which I know he ($_izuku) will not like . I have to find a way to be myself while staying in his favor . I still have my family s name and welfare to think of . Izuku ($_izuku) gave Todoroki ($_todoroki) a little smile . I 'm bound in chains , too . Mine just ca n't be seen . ''", "It s alright . I forgive you . Izuku ($_izuku) said . I m going now . If anyone asks for me , you may tell them I went out for a walk . \n", "Once his ($_izuku) boots hit the snow , Izuku ($_izuku) looked up at the gray sky above . The snow came up to his ($_izuku) ankles . He ($_izuku) didn t care though . He ($_izuku) started to run through the snow , racing through the courtyard and stopping in the garden to throw himself ($_izuku) onto the white powder . Izuku ($_izuku) lay on his ($_izuku) back , feeling the snow chill through his ($_izuku) clothes as he ($_izuku) let the tiny snowflakes melt on his ($_izuku) heated cheeks . He ($_izuku) was still thinking about Todoroki ($_todoroki) s kiss , so soft and gentle . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) quickly left his ($_izuku) chambers , rushing through the halls and down the stairs to one of the nearest exits . Servants bowed to him ($_izuku) along the way , but he ($_izuku) barely acknowledged them . He ($_izuku) had to get out of this castle and clear his ($_izuku) head before he ($_izuku) bursts into tears once again . Then everyone will see that omega s can t control their emotions , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) will have won . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) closed his ($_izuku) eyes . He ($_izuku) should have never let Todoroki ($_todoroki) kiss him ($_izuku) . The second their lips touched , he ($_izuku) should have pushed the alpha away . What if Kacchan ($_kacchan) had seen them ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) will end up in a dungeon , and he ($_izuku) will end up divorced , disgraced , and penniless . \n", " Everything worked out in the end , though , Izuku ($_izuku) said . Kirishima and Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) both helped me to save Bakugo ($_bakugo) . I wouldn t have been able to do it on my own . The champion had been too skilled for him . The important thing is that Bakugo ($_bakugo) is safe now .", "Izuku ($_izuku) was about to respond when Bakugo ($_bakugo) started coughing . He ($_izuku) grabbed the cloth from the end table and held it to_Bakugo ($_bakugo) s mouth , catching the little spatters of blood that came with the cleansing of the poison . Izuku ($_izuku) wiped away the bit of red dotting the corners of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s mouth . \n", "Oh , it s okay , Izuku ($_izuku) said . I wasn t sure about that feeling , either . I knew I just had to go with it , and I m glad that I did . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) looked to the door to see Todoroki ($_todoroki) had entered with Iida ($_iida) . Todoroki ($_todoroki) had a bowl of water for Bakugo ($_bakugo) s fever , and Iida ($_iida) held a tray of food . Izuku ($_izuku) smiled at them and waved the pair over . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) , look over there , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) pointed to a soldier bringing over something long wrapped in a cloth . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) looked down at his ($_izuku) boots . Kacchan ($_kacchan) said I embarrassed him ($_izuku) by saving his ($_izuku) life , \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) took a step back from Todoroki ($_todoroki) s touch and tightened the green woolen cloak higher on his ($_izuku) shoulders to cover his ($_izuku) neck . It s nothing , \n", "He ($_izuku) hurt you this morning , didn t he ($_izuku) ? \n", "Trust me , I know , Izuku ($_izuku) gripped his ($_izuku) fists . He ($_izuku) s told me numerous times . But I will not apologize for saving my husband , no matter how mad he ($_izuku) gets at me ! \n", "I wish Kacchan ($_kacchan) did , Izuku ($_izuku) said while refreshing the cloth for Bakugo ($_bakugo) s fever . Would you mind putting more wood on the fire ? I don t want him to catch a chill . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) gave him ($_izuku) a little smile , admiring Izuku ($_izuku) s values and logic . Even if I preferred you not to be on the battlefield , I would have you on my war council . I trust your judgment . \n", "It makes sense , Izuku ($_izuku) said . But , he ($_izuku) lifted his ($_izuku) eyes to look at Todoroki ($_todoroki) . Shouldn t it be my choice in the end , and I ll deal with the consequences ? \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) did understand , but that still didn t mean it was fair . \n", " That would have been nice but , it s not how things worked out . Izuku ($_izuku) kept his ($_izuku) eyes down at his ($_izuku) lap . To be honest I hoped to become a hero or at least a writer , and I never expected marriage to happen .

He doesn t think omegas belong on the battlefield .", "Telling Kacchan ($_kacchan) that Todoroki ($_todoroki) would make a better husband is what led to their mating in the first place . Now he ($_izuku) pictured what it would be like mating with Todoroki ($_todoroki) . He ($_izuku) quickly shook the image from his ($_izuku) head .

That alone awakened a little flutter of hope in his ($_izuku) chest . But his ($_izuku) attention returned to his ($_izuku) mate when Bakugo ($_bakugo) started coughing again .
