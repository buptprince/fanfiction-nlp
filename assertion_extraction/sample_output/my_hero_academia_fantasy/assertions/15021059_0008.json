Izuku ($_izuku) was curious to know what messages they were , so he ($_izuku) made a detour for Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) s room . It is only a few doors down from his ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) had a rough idea as to why Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) kept the messages from Shoto ($_shoto) a secret . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) saw the danger in Shoto ($_shoto) s feelings for him ($_tokoyami) as well . Still , the gamma should have delivered the messages as asked .", " Izuku ($_izuku) heard rumbling from behind the door , something falling , and a few thumps . The door opened , and Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) appeared , straightening his ($_tokoyami) helmet . Izuku ($_izuku) just looked at the gamma , realizing that the other got dressed in a hurry . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) never allowed himself ($_tokoyami) to be ill-prepared or caught off-guard .", " Early this morning , Uraraka ($_uraraka) brought his ($_uraraka) breakfast with a message from Kacchan saying that his ($_uraraka) husband has need of him ($_uraraka) today , so Izuku ($_izuku) is on the way to Kacchan s private office . He ($_uraraka) didn t expect people to be present in the main hall when he ($_uraraka) passed through . They all bowed to him ($_uraraka) respectfully , stating only his ($_uraraka) title Dom-Omega and nothing else . A few times when he ($_uraraka) glanced back , he ($_uraraka) saw some whispering .

Izuku ($_izuku) knew he ($_izuku) closed and locked the door to the water closet . The window can not be open and is too small for anyone to sneak inside if they broke through . It must be his ($_izuku) imagination . Then he ($_izuku) heard the gentle whisper of slow-moving chains along the floor . He ($_izuku) sat up quickly , splashing some of the water and pulled the washcloth from his ($_izuku) face .

He ($_izuku) wished he ($_izuku) had ordered the whole pie instead . \n", "With a belly full of venison stew , bread , and winterberry pie , Izuku ($_izuku) went to the water closet where the fragrant bath is waiting for him ($_izuku) . After catching a slight chill from the winter rain , he ($_izuku) wanted a hot bath to keep away any chance of getting sick . He ($_izuku) sighed with content as his ($_izuku) naked body sank into the water , inhaling the aroma of rosemary . The strong scent eased the tension in his ($_izuku) head and behind his ($_izuku) eyes as he ($_izuku) relaxed against the back of the tub . The rain still pattered on the glass of the tiny window , but the sound only added to the calming atmosphere , which is what he ($_izuku) desperately needed . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) just stared at him ($_izuku) , wringing the washcloth nervously in his ($_izuku) hands .

I ll find you ($_don) later , Regretfully , he ($_kacchan) left Izuku ($_izuku) s side to walk around to the front of the shed to face the guards . I m here . I just had to relieve myself .", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) narrowed his eyes at Bakugo ($_bakugo) through his red and white bangs . I m just as mighty an alpha as you are , Katsuki_Bakugo ($_bakugo) .

After that night , Izuku ($_izuku) Izuku_couldn_t_face_Shoto_anyway ($_shoto) . He ($_uraraka) d be too embarrassed to look into Shoto ($_shoto) s eyes , which would hold hurt and betrayal . Izuku ($_izuku) s omega body had given in to Kacchan s alpha advances without much of a struggle . The biggest risk that night was Kacchan ($_kacchan) finding out that Izuku ($_izuku) and Shoto ($_shoto) have been together . Intimately. It s best if he ($_uraraka) stays away from Shoto ($_shoto) for the next few days because his ($_uraraka) first heat cycle of the year is on its way .

It s not the same , you little twerp !", " He ($_izuku) reached out to grab Deku ($_deku) by the biceps and pull the smaller body against him ($_izuku) . You re a threat to me because you re my omega .", " My enemies now have something to horde over me - they can use you to get to me , just like that_asshole ($_izuku) did tonight ! I broke his fucking jaw because he thinks I would just toss you away ! Oh , I want to ; make no mistake about that ! But despite all that , what I fucking hate the most , He crushed his lips to Izuku ($_izuku) s while ripping the robe from the omega s body . Is the thought of you being out of my life .", " Then let s make it more interesting , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said with a dark , evil grin . Deku ($_deku) s heat will be here with the next full moon . We both know omegas are blind to everything but an alpha when they are in heat . If you want to fuck Izuku ($_izuku) so bad , then you have to fight me first . This challenge will happen when Deku ($_deku) goes into heat .", " Izuku ($_izuku) will be our war prize . What do you ($_izuku) say to that , Shoto Todoroki ? Will you ($_izuku) fight for the right to fuck the_omega ($_the) ? ''", " As Izuku ($_izuku) walked by the firewood shed , he ($_izuku) thought he ($_izuku) saw someone move out of the corner of his ($_izuku) eye . He ($_izuku) turned in the direction but saw no one . Izuku ($_izuku) heard talking and looked to the right to see two guards speaking to one another . Whatever he ($_izuku) saw must have been an animal , like a rabbit or a squirrel .", " Regardless , he ($_izuku) did not want to be near the guards , so he ($_izuku) hurried past the shed only to be gripped by the wrist and pulled behind it . Before he ($_izuku) could cry out , a shackled hand covered his ($_izuku) mouth , silencing him ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) s nose picked up the scent of spearmint . Shoto ($_shoto) !", "I don t fuck , I mate , Todoroki ($_todoroki) countered . And I accept your ($_izuku) challenge . We battle for Izuku the night of his heat . The winner gets to claim him as their own . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) smirked . You ($_izuku) re on . \n", " Izuku ($_izuku) was grateful for the documents to keep his ($_izuku) mind from wandering and he ($_izuku) finished signing the last one with a sigh of relief . He ($_izuku) placed the quill back on the desk and stretched his ($_izuku) back in the chair , bending left to right a few times for good measure . Turning to the window , the sound of rain pattered at the glass . It s too cloudy to make out precisely what time of day it is , but Izuku ($_izuku) assumed it had to be early evening . His ($_izuku) stomach rumbled reminding him ($_izuku) that he ($_izuku) should eat something . Uraraka had brought up a tray of winterberries and fresh milk for him ($_izuku) as a snack , but he ($_izuku) had neglected it , being so focused on work rather than the needs of his ($_izuku) stomach . Now he ($_izuku) eagerly ate the berries , thinking about how good they will be baked in a pie . He ($_izuku) can still smell the baked good from this morning .", "I think you should talk to the laundry servants . They must have given you the wrong size undershirt . Izuku ($_izuku) said , referring to the overly large shirt that barely fit Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) s slender yet toned form . He ($_izuku) chuckled to himself ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) walked away . At least someone is having fun today . \n", " His ($_bakugo) heart ached in his ($_bakugo) chest , and through his ($_bakugo) anger and jealousy , he ($_bakugo) felt like crying . It was torture to hear Izuku ($_izuku) begging and pleading for more of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s mounting . Unable to bear it any longer , Todoroki ($_todoroki) left the water closet to exit through the secret stair . He ($_bakugo) knows what he ($_bakugo) must do . The battle for Izuku ($_izuku) s heart has to be decided and soon . The only way to keep Izuku ($_izuku) from Bakugo_'s ($_bakugo) wrath is to win him ($_izuku) from the warlord . Where there 's a will , there 's a way .", "Oh , yeah , Izuku ($_izuku) explained to him ($_tokoyami) what Kacchan ($_kacchan) is having him ($_tokoyami) do . I just have one question , He ($_tokoyami) looked around to make sure no one was listening . Why didn t you deliver the messages from Shoto ($_shoto) ? \n", " Izuku ($_izuku) nodded . Yes. I m sorry for bothering you . I did give you the_day ($_the) off , after all . He ($_tokoyami) smiled . Enjoy it .", "Izuku ($_izuku) s smile widened at Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) s attempt to be serious after being caught . To mention the fact that someone is hiding under Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) s bed would only embarrass the gamma further . It s so rare to see his friend out of sorts and flustered . And yet , he couldn t help himself . He had to say something . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) face away so Shoto couldn t see his ($_izuku) embarrassment . You ($_don) shouldn t be around me , \n", "The ones I ve been sending with Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) . Has he ($_izuku) not delivered them to you ($_don) ? \n", "Messages ? What messages ?

He ($_izuku) effortlessly pulled Deku ($_deku) s body towards his ($_izuku) , watching the smaller male squirm while trying to escape . That s right , you re not mine to take , he ($_izuku) whispered in Deku ($_deku) s ear . But you want nothing more than to have me ravish you with both love and lust , He ($_izuku) licked Deku ($_deku) s earlobe . Aren t I right ?", "Kacchan can t you love me in private ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked . No one has to know or see . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) felt his ($_izuku) cock and nipples harden once again with Kacchan ($_kacchan) s rough treatment and husky words .

Izuku ($_izuku) does want the alpha s love as much as his ($_izuku) body craves the alpha s touch . The scent of smoked cherrywood engulfed his ($_izuku) senses , and he ($_izuku) relaxed in Kacchan ($_kacchan) s hold . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) sniffled a bit , wiping at his ($_izuku) eyes with his ($_izuku) sleeve . \n", " Izuku ($_izuku) thanked the male for bringing him ($_izuku) the cloak and threw it over his ($_izuku) shoulders , clasping it together under his ($_izuku) chin . He ($_izuku) pulled the hood up and left the kitchen , walking through the servants path that opened up into the main garden .", " All the snow had washed away with the winter rain that came , and remained , since yesterday morning .

Outside it s quiet with only the sound of raindrops on the stone path . A branch cracked above him ($_izuku) , and Izuku ($_izuku) looked up at the exact moment a cardinal took off , letting loose a tiny torrent of raindrops on his ($_izuku) face .

That was meant to hurt me , to keep me from coming near you ($_don) - he ($_kacchan) was putting his ($_kacchan) mark on you ($_don) . Don ($_don) t you ($_don) see , Izuku ($_izuku) ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) only wants something when he ($_bakugo) realizes that someone else wants it ($_bakugo) !", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) kissed Izuku ($_izuku) s forehead . He ($_kacchan) can t kill me . I m his ($_kacchan) bargaining chip in this territory battle . \n", "Then say you ($_don) ll leave with me , Todoroki ($_todoroki) kept Izuku ($_izuku) from leaving again by grabbing the omega s wrist . When the time comes , say you ($_don) ll leave with me ! Say it ! \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) turned to face him ($_todoroki) . What are you ($_don) doing here ? \n", "But it s true , Todoroki ($_todoroki) nipped at Izuku s earlobe . I m going to make you mine , Izuku Midoriya . \n", "You re near your heat , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . \n", "He ($_izuku) doesn t deserve it , Todoroki ($_todoroki) growled out , fighting against Izuku ($_izuku) s hold to keep stroking at the slit . He ($_izuku) doesn t own it , Izuku ($_izuku) . You do ! He ($_izuku) brought Izuku ($_izuku) s lips into a kiss . You decide who should have your virginity ! \n", " That beautiful silhouette belongs to him ($_bakugo) ; not to Bakugo . Todoroki ($_todoroki) felt his ($_bakugo) alpha aura and primitive instincts taking over . His ($_bakugo) anger and jealousy grew with each arch and cry of pleasure from Izuku ($_izuku) . Todoroki ($_todoroki) gripped the wood of the doorframe , squeezing it hard enough where he ($_bakugo) heard the wood splinter under pressure . He ($_bakugo) almost burst out from his ($_bakugo) hiding spot when Bakugo ($_bakugo) flipped their positions , so he ($_bakugo) was on top of Izuku ($_izuku) . Todoroki ($_todoroki) couldn t stand to see Bakugo ($_bakugo) s filthy cock thrusting into his ($_bakugo) omega , so he ($_bakugo) turned himself ($_bakugo) away from the scene .", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) hated to admit that Kirishima ($_kirishima) has a point , but Todoroki ($_todoroki) is only one person - one example . He ($_bakugo) knows that Todoroki ($_todoroki) hates his ($_bakugo) father Enji , but the Lord of the West treasures his ($_bakugo) prodigy son .", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) does not fear Todoroki ($_todoroki) taking over in his ($_bakugo) father s place . His ($_bakugo) enemy will be easy to subdue . There is no challenge in Shoto Todoroki .", " However , no one would be surprised if Shoto ($_shoto) turned on his ($_shoto) father for everything that Lord Enji has done to the Todoroki ($_todoroki) family . Before capturing Shoto ($_shoto) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) gambled on whether or not to set the enemy free . He ($_bakugo) didn t_view_Shoto_as_a_real_threat ($_shoto) , though letting the alpha return to his ($_bakugo) home wasn t an option either .", "That would be a nightmare come to life , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said with a laugh . Seriously though , Bakugo_,_His_voice ($_voice) lost its ($_voice) humor . You shouldn t force your alpha child to be just like you in every way . Look at Todoroki ($_todoroki) . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) approached the tub . Do you ($_don) want me ($_don) to ? \n", "I ($_don) can t stay long , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said , kneeling beside the tub and reaching out his ($_izuku) hand to stroke Izuku s hair . The omega leaned into his ($_izuku) touch , almost purring . Todoroki ($_todoroki) loved how the wild green curls felt between his ($_izuku) fingers . He ($_izuku) didn t know if Izuku ($_izuku) s freckled cheeks are flushed from the hot water or from his ($_izuku) touch . But I ($_don) had to see you ($_don) again . \n", "It s just me , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said softly , removing his ($_todoroki) hand from Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth . \n", " But as he ($_izuku) let himself ($_izuku) relax , his ($_izuku) ears picked up the sound of a door opening . Izuku ($_izuku) knew he ($_izuku) closed and locked the door to the water closet . The window can not be open and is too small for anyone to sneak inside if they broke through . It must be his ($_izuku) imagination . Then he ($_izuku) heard the gentle whisper of slow-moving chains along the floor . He ($_izuku) sat up quickly , splashing some of the water and pulled the washcloth from his ($_izuku) face . Izuku ($_izuku) looked around until he ($_izuku) caught sight of Todoroki ($_todoroki) in the water closet with him ($_izuku) .", "There s a secret stair , Todoroki ($_todoroki) answered , pushing aside a tapestry to show a small , narrow door . It starts in the servant quarters . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) put a finger to his ($_izuku) lips . \n", " Todoroki ($_todoroki) quickly pulled Izuku ($_izuku) into a kiss . I ll leave first , He ($_kacchan) whispered against Izuku ($_izuku) s cold , panting lips .", " Todoroki ($_todoroki) wanted to do more with Izuku than kiss him ($_kacchan) ; the omega s sweet scent is clouding his ($_kacchan) senses . I ll find you ($_don) later , Regretfully , he ($_kacchan) left Izuku ($_izuku) s side to walk around to the front of the shed to face the guards . I m here . I just had to relieve myself .", "Slowly , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stood up from his ($_bakugo) desk , glaring at Todoroki ($_todoroki) . You ve got a lot of fucking nerve walking into my room running at the mouth , slave . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) took a few steps to the center of the room and said , \n", "The head of wild blonde hair looked up from the papers at the sound of his ($_bakugo) name . Todoroki ($_todoroki) turned to the guards , asking for privacy . When the guards didn t leave on his ($_bakugo) request , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stepped in and ordered them to go . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) narrowed his eyes at Bakugo ($_bakugo) through his red and white bangs . I m just as mighty an alpha as you are , Katsuki_Bakugo ($_bakugo) . You don t deserve an_omega_like_Izuku ($_the) Izuku ($_izuku) . Again , I challenge you to win Izuku ($_izuku) s hand ! Do you accept ? \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) let out a laugh . Are you serious right now ? You re in no position to challenge me , Todoroki ($_todoroki) . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) walked around his ($_bakugo) desk , shoved his ($_bakugo) hands in the pockets of his ($_bakugo) pants , and approached Todoroki ($_todoroki) . The two stood nose-to-nose , glare-to-glare . Both can sense the alpha power radiating off the other . \n", "I don t fuck , I mate , Todoroki ($_todoroki) countered . And I accept your ($_izuku) challenge . We battle for Izuku the night of his heat . The winner gets to claim him as their own . \n", " His ($_bakugo) heart ached in his ($_bakugo) chest , and through his ($_bakugo) anger and jealousy , he ($_bakugo) felt like crying . It was torture to hear Izuku ($_izuku) begging and pleading for more of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s mounting . Unable to bear it any longer , Todoroki ($_todoroki) left the water closet to exit through the secret stair . He ($_bakugo) knows what he ($_bakugo) must do . The battle for Izuku ($_izuku) s heart has to be decided and soon . The only way to keep Izuku ($_izuku) from Bakugo_'s ($_bakugo) wrath is to win him ($_izuku) from the warlord . Where there 's a will , there 's a way .", "The next day , Todoroki ($_todoroki) insisted on having the guards set up an audience with Bakugo ($_bakugo) . At first , his ($_bakugo) audience was denied ; but Todoroki ($_todoroki) kept insisting . Soon they brought him ($_bakugo) to Bakugo ($_bakugo) s private office where he ($_bakugo) entered , fearless , and shouted Bakugo ($_bakugo) s name . \n", "I wanted to speak to you ($_don) , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . You ($_don) haven t been answering any of my messages . \n", "No , don t go yet , Todoroki ($_todoroki) trapped Izuku_in_an ($_in) embrace using the chain that linked his ($_in) shackles together . He ($_in) pulled Izuku ($_izuku) close , resting their ($_izuku) foreheads together . I don t see you ($_don) as Bakugo ($_bakugo) s omega ($_omega) ; I see you ($_don) as my_omega ($_omega) . \n", " I ll take you ($_don) away from here , Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . I ll take you ($_don) to the west and make you ($_don) the Dom-Omega of my land , he ($_izuku) stared deeply into Izuku ($_izuku) s worried green eyes , wanting only to comfort the_omega ($_omega) and assure him ($_izuku) that all will be well . We can change the world , Izuku ($_izuku) . Together. We ll rule side-by-side , as equals . There is no reason why you ($_don) must waste away under the iron fist of that_barbarian_warlord ($_izuku) .", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) guided Izuku ($_izuku) s face closer to his ($_izuku) . You ($_don) ve never once said that you ($_don) are concerned for your ($_don) own safety , he ($_izuku) pointed out . I ($_don) wouldn t come to you ($_don) if I ($_don) thought the timing was bad . Don ($_don) t you ($_don) believe me ($_don) ? \n", "Gathering wood , Todoroki ($_todoroki) answered . The guards aren t paying much attention . \n"], "($_deku)": ["HEY ! DEKU ($_deku) ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) s voice came from the other side of the door , his ($_bakugo) fist pounding against it . YOU IN THERE ? \n", "He ($_deku) thinks it , Bakugo ($_bakugo) pointed a card at Kirishima ($_kirishima) to emphasize his ($_deku) point . I ve known him ($_deku) for a long time . He ($_deku) knows how to keep quiet and act like he ($_deku) isn t aware , but believe me , Deku ($_deku) is very focused on his ($_deku) thoughts and is always thinking . I see the wheels turning in his ($_deku) head like a fine carriage . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) rolled his ($_bakugo) eyes . Hardly. I m smarter than him ($_bakugo) , but Deku ($_deku) is no dummy when it comes to academics . He ($_bakugo) s an idiot in every other form , though . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) let out a laugh . You seem to be threatened by his ($_deku) intelligence ! \n", " Can t you tell when it s nearing ? I need to make sure I m here for you when it hits . He enjoyed the bright blush on Deku ($_deku) s already reddened cheeks .", "I ll do things differently , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said . Shoto ($_shoto) s mistake was allowing himself ($_shoto) to be a mama s boy . I won t let Deku ($_deku) soften my alpha child like that . \n", "Right after Kirishima ($_kirishima) left , Deku ($_deku) came in , looking flushed and out of sorts . Bakugo ($_bakugo) narrowed his ($_bakugo) eyes at the omega , following the green form as Deku ($_deku) approached him ($_bakugo) . \n", " He ($_izuku) reached out to grab Deku ($_deku) by the biceps and pull the smaller body against him ($_izuku) . You re a threat to me because you re my omega .", " Then let s make it more interesting , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said with a dark , evil grin . Deku ($_deku) s heat will be here with the next full moon . We both know omegas are blind to everything but an alpha when they are in heat . If you want to fuck Izuku ($_izuku) so bad , then you have to fight me first . This challenge will happen when Deku ($_deku) goes into heat .", " Before Izuku ($_izuku) could answer him ($_izuku) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hand shot out and gripped the omega s throat . He ($_izuku) effortlessly pulled Deku ($_deku) s body towards his ($_izuku) , watching the smaller male squirm while trying to escape . That s right , you re not mine to take , he ($_izuku) whispered in Deku ($_deku) s ear . But you want nothing more than to have me ravish you with both love and lust , He ($_izuku) licked Deku ($_deku) s earlobe . Aren t I right ?", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) released Deku ($_deku) s neck . If I didn t need your family , I would never have agreed to marry you , He ($_bakugo) said . I wouldn t have taken any omega bride , male or female if circumstance didn t force me to . \n", "I wouldn t call that power , He said . There s nothing important about who says this_land ($_kirishima) is their land or this chicken is their chicken . As if I have time for horseshit like that . It ($_kirishima) will keep Deku ($_deku) busy , and I can stop hearing him ($_deku) whine about , I should be able to do more like you , he ($_deku) said the last line in his ($_deku) best Deku-mocking voice . \n", "I broke the jaw of one of my allies , Bakugo answered . Want to know why? He ($_bakugo) turned to glare at Deku ($_deku) . Because he ($_bakugo) said that he ($_bakugo) will gladly take you off my hands if I ever get bored of you . \n", "They all like to whisper behind my back , Deku ($_deku) said . But I hear them . \n", "I needed some air , Deku ($_deku) said . There were so many people in the main hall I wasn t expecting them . \n", "Deku ($_deku) smiled tiredly at him ($_bakugo) and said , We used to eat wild strawberries together . Remember? \n", "So many , Deku ($_deku) said , looking at the backpack of rolled up documents Bakugo ($_bakugo) held out to him ($_bakugo) . \n", "Just ignore them . Now , I m only going to explain this once , so pay attention ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) explained to Deku ($_deku) what he ($_bakugo) is to do with the documents ; read through them , make a judgment , and then sign it . Make sure to sign them all Dom-Omega of Mount Fervor . \n"]}
