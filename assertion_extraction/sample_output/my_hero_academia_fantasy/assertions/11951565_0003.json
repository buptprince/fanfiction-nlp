Her ($_ochako) hair was far too short , but her ($_ochako) brown eyes did look a little familiar . \n", "Storming to the steering wheel , his face was bright red as he glared angrily at the entire crew . `` I 'm going to prove to you this woman is my Princess , '' he said , keeping his finger locked on Uraraka_'s ($_uraraka) round face . `` By taking back my home island from the_Academy ($_the) !

I ($_tokoyami) take you 're not the only two who think this ? ''", " \"Good!\" He thrust his finger towards Uraraka ($_uraraka) , pointing directly at her . `` This is Uraraka Ochako . I rescued her when I was a fucking servant boy in her kitchen . She is Princess of my home island and if you do n't believe me you can leave my fucking ship !
