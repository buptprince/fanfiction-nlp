All he ($_katsuki) had to do was get onto the castle grounds and find the_prince ($_the) and it was all going to be great '' \n", "Turning around , he ($_katsuki) noticed a large swath of vine crawling up the wall .

They ($_iida) were never-ending , after every person that went past him ($_in) , another was sure to follow . Back and forth , back and forth ; it felt like what little_space_Katsuki ($_katsuki) had was quickly closing in on him ($_in) and all he ($_in) could do was back away , nearly tripping over his ($_in) feet every step of the way . \n", "Face scrunched up in displeasure , Katsuki ($_katsuki) simply stuck out his ($_katsuki) tongue at the fairy .

He ($_katsuki) was hesitating for no reason . \n", "Walking across the hill , Katsuki ($_katsuki) looked to his ($_katsuki) left and saw the top of the castle gate , a large , looming bird-reptile creature sculpted at the top of the enormous structure of stone .

The squabbles he ($_katsuki) heard from there also deterred him ($_katsuki) from going near them . The building behind them had a single door with a large staircase and a weird object painted on the wall . There was a large sign above the door that read : Bombchu Bowling Alley . Looking from the sign to the painting on the wall , Katsuki ($_katsuki) was able to answer his ($_katsuki) own questions . \n", "Oh , did Katsuki ($_katsuki) forget to mention ... there were a lot of people ! \n", "`` I ($_kaminari) 'm not too sure , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ...

'' \n", "Quickly running down the archway , the only sound was the rhythmic tapping of Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) shoes against the hard marble of the ground and the soft flow of water . Beyond him ($_katsuki) , he ($_katsuki) saw a large patch of grass , shinned golden from the slowly rising light of the morning . Father ahead , he ($_katsuki) saw a large wall at the end of the pathway , hollowed , carved , and engraved . \n", " Slowly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) began walking deeper inside the area ; looking straight forward , he ($_katsuki) saw a small stairway leading to a large window . The slabs of marble that framed the window curved upwards and then jutted out in angular winged shapes . And in between those wings , he ($_katsuki) saw that inescapable symbol those golden triangles . On the wall around them , thick , elegant vines curled against the stone , intricate patterns forming from their uniform growth , small pink flowers bloomed from the vines , adding a feeling a grace when looking at the small buds . The think railings of the small stairway and the slabs of marble that jutted out and framed the wall had ornate symbols and carvings engraved on their surface .", "But there was one certain detail that Katsuki ($_katsuki) could not miss .

On both sides from where he ($_katsuki) stood on the last few tiles of marble , a thin moat of shallow , slow moving water flowed underneath him ($_katsuki) . Looking up , looming tapestries colored with green and gold hung from the sides of the encircling wall before him ($_katsuki) ; the tops of the cloths held the familiar golden triangles stitched in center . Rows upon rows of the grass was filled will blooming plants of varying sizes and colors . To his left , he even saw two tiny figs growing near a patch of peonies . \n", "Moving his ($_katsuki) hands about , he ($_katsuki) rattled on , `` And they 're not all known as Ma , either ; there 's Mom , Mother , Mama , Mommy all sorts of variations !

As far as the eye could see , Katsuki ($_katsuki) and Tenya_'s ($_tenya) vision was filled with a vast array of people all shapes and sizes . The people wore so many different colors , most_Katsuki ($_most) did n't even think existed . \n", "A loud commotion sounded to his and Tenya_'s ($_tenya) right ; turning , they saw an enormous crowd of people who easily towered over them gathered around what looked like and open market area . Through the giant figures blocking their sight , they were able to pick out a large table , covered in all sorts of goods and items . With the vast lot of people crowding the small area , it seemed that they easily took up a fourth of the space in the town square . \n", "Looking down , he ($_katsuki) began to pout , then he ($_katsuki) whipped his ($_katsuki) head around to look at Tenya ($_tenya) . \n", "Tenya ($_tenya) fluttered around his ($_tenya) head as he ($_tenya) climbed , `` You know , that was a nice thing you said you 'd do . '' \n", "Grunting as he ($_tenya) forced his ($_tenya) muscles to exertion , he ($_tenya) bit out , `` You think so ? '' \n", "Tenya ($_tenya) furrowed his ($_tenya) brow , `` What do n't you ($_tenya) get ? '' \n", "Shaking his ($_tenya) head , he ($_tenya) sighed and turned away from his ($_tenya) smaller companion , `` It does n't matter right now . I need to find out which way it is to the castle ... '' \n", "There was another alleyway next to the Bombchu building , and then just more buildings the followed . As he ($_tenya) made a full circle , he ($_tenya) saw a shooting gallery , a bunch of people , another alleyway albeit much wider than the others he ($_tenya) had seen ; a `` Happy Mask '' shop , a whole bunch more people , a `` potion '' shop , more people , another shop called `` Cementoss . '' In the center of the town square there was a large fountain of water . Even in the low light , the clear water sparkled so brightly . \n", "Finger on his ($_tenya) lips , the_boy ($_iida) simply looked around to try and see all the possible areas . It was so hard to from where he ($_tenya) was . There were so many people moving past him ($_tenya) , and they all towered over him ($_tenya) , he ($_tenya) swore was going to be crushed . \n"]}
