Unlike the previous two challenges , nobody seems to be in any immediate danger when they arrive at a bright , golden kingdom . In fact , everyone seems elated , staring around in awe without smiles on their faces . Not Aoyama , though - he doesn t trust this place at all . Fake happiness is something he s familiar with , and seeing people act so much like him is really disconcerting . 
I think we should hurry and find the_Crown ($_the) . . Aoyama ($_aoyama) suggests , trailing off , but nobody can hear him . Well , he suspects they can , they re just ignoring him . Everyone is getting along in one big group and he s left out , but that isn t much different from before . Guys ! he yells , a little bit louder . 
They ignore him again , so he takes a tentative step towards their group , followed by a few more . He s right outside their group when the closest person turns to him - oh , why did it have to be Iida ($_iida) ? - and glares. The knight s face isn t wearing an expression he s seen before , and it scares him . Iida ($_iida) . . ? Pray tell , what could you possibly - 
He gets cut off , as he should expect . It s none of your business , whoever you are . This pertains to the company and the company only . Perhaps if he were paying more attention , he d know that Iida ($_iida) s voice isn t quite his own at the moment , too forced to be real . But , well , he s too shocked to pay attention . 
What are you talking about ? I. . I am part of the company , aren t I ? Don ($_don) t start crying , Aoyama ($_aoyama) repeats over and over in his ($_aoyama) head . Don ($_don) t start crying . Don ($_don) t start crying . Don ($_don) t get emotional . Really , you should have a better memory , don t you think ? We were just talking , before the last challenge . . 
Iida ($_iida) only glares more , in stark contrast to the overjoyed attitude he ($_iida) had just been presenting . Aoyama ($_aoyama) is once again shocked at how much of himself ($_aoyama) he ($_iida) sees in a hateful stare like that . I think I d remember meeting someone so foolish . Right, well, that hurts. But he ($_iida) can t start crying . That would be weak of him ($_iida) , wouldn t it ? Leave the company alone and don t come back . You re not worthy enough to even want to be a part of it . 
And , just like that , the glare is gone and he ($_iida) s turned away , an airy smile on his ($_iida) face once more as he ($_iida) talks to the others about something that doesn t even matter in terms of the challenges . 
Maybe you should stay here , a voice inside of him ($_iida) says , they re not going to let you continue , so just stay in the kingdom . You don t belong with their group . The voice in his ($_iida) head is definitely not him ($_iida) , and that terrifies him ($_iida) . If they can get in his ($_iida) head , why didn t they make him ($_iida) happy too ? Why leave him ($_iida) out of this , why him ($_iida) ? Is it because this is how he ($_iida) acts normally ? 
Or is it because he ($_iida) s the challenger ? 
The thought is only in his ($_iida) head for a second before he ($_iida) washes it away . He ($_iida) s obviously not the challenger , right ? It s just as Iida ($_iida) says ; he ($_iida) s not worthy enough . The bearers need to be people who are brave and strong , and Aoyama ($_aoyama) is neither of those things . 
He ($_iida) tries yet again to talk to the group , through Midoriya this time , but as soon as he ($_iida) sees the harsh glare he ($_iida) steps back and turns away . If they won t talk to him ($_iida) , then maybe he ($_iida) should go off on his ($_iida) own . He ($_iida) d at least wanted to bring someone with him ($_iida) on his ($_iida) search for the_Crown ($_the) , but it ($_the) seems that s not the way things will be playing out . If he ($_iida) wants to search , he ($_iida) ll have to go alone , and he ($_iida) thinks , what a funny coincidence , that I have to search by myself . It s as if they re setting this up for the challenger . That thought is gone as soon as it enters his head . 
He doesn t know where he s going , but he follows what looks to be the main road of the kingdom for a short while . There appears to be bustling in some of the small shops and houses , as if people are in there , but nobody is on the streets besides him , and that s almost as eerie as it would be if there were some kind of fake people . 
Only a few times , Aoyama ($_aoyama) looks back , to see if the rest of the company has followed him ($_aoyama) , but nobody has . That s just as well , they d probably yell at him for being over here at all anyway , what with him not even being a part of their fantasy company . 
The road he follows stops at a closed golden gate , which swings open as soon as he gets close . He s just been let into a magnificent castle , and perhaps if it were a real kingdom he d take some time to admire how gorgeous the architecture is . This is all so very fake , though , so he steps in and doesn t give the castle a second glance . 
He s barely even moved inside the gate when he hears shouting from behind him . Kirishima ($_kirishima) is tailing him , a storm of fire all around him , and Iida ($_iida) is not far behind with what looks to be a hurricane that barely avoids touching Kirishima ($_kirishima) s fire . Aoyama ($_aoyama) is frozen in place for a few seconds , shocked , but then he ($_aoyama) turns and runs into the castle , ignoring their shouting for him ($_aoyama) to stop , ignoring them saying he ($_aoyama) s not welcome here . 
He ($_aoyama) runs past the entrance hall and turns where it feels right , letting his ($_aoyama) gut take over rather than his ($_aoyama) mind . Running is all he ($_aoyama) can do right now , and he ($_aoyama) can t stop to think rationally unless he ($_aoyama) wants to be attacked , so he ($_aoyama) lets the feeling of something pull him ($_aoyama) where he ($_aoyama) needs to go . 
It turns out that the feeling has led him ($_aoyama) to a pair of large double doors . He ($_aoyama) doesn t know if he ($_aoyama) can even get them open , and he ($_aoyama) s tempted to find another way to evade them , but the shouting is getting louder , so he ($_aoyama) slams into the double doors with all he ($_aoyama) has . Even that barely gets them to open , and now the entire left side of his ($_aoyama) body hurts . Marvelous. He ($_aoyama) runs inside , only focused on getting away until he ($_aoyama) sees what he ($_aoyama) s just stumbled into . 
This is a throne room , or at least , the equivalent of a throne room in this fake castle . There is one throne all the way at the end of the room and a golden crown resting on it . That s the crown , he ($_aoyama) realizes , that s the feeling . 
The shouting comes to an abrupt stop , so he ($_aoyama) turns around , only to meet the stars of two very confused company members . Aoyama ($_aoyama) ? Iida ($_iida) asks , disbelief in his ($_iida) eyes as he ($_iida) stares from across the hall . Why were we chasing you ? Why did you leave ? 
It s then that he ($_iida) realizes that this was all a part of the challenge . There was a reason for them acting strangely and not remembering him ($_iida) , and maybe he ($_iida) was the challenger . 
It doesn t matter , does it ? he ($_iida) asks , his ($_iida) head tilting to the side lightly . Iida ($_iida) slowly shakes his ($_iida) head , a puzzled look still splayed across his ($_iida) face . Kirishima ($_kirishima) is staring wide-eyed at the crown . 
That s the Crown , isn t it ? Capital-C crown ? Aoyama ($_aoyama) s not sure , but he ($_aoyama) nods anyway , then turns to it . It s as if he ($_aoyama) s being pulled in when he ($_aoyama) walks , and when he ($_aoyama) settles his ($_aoyama) hands on either side of the crown , there s a warm feeling inside of him ($_aoyama) . He ($_aoyama) grabs it and places it on his ($_aoyama) head . 
For a moment , nothing happens . Then , Iida ($_iida) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) express their simultaneous surprise and he ($_iida) just barely manages to catch that he ($_iida) s apparently glowing before something even more odd happens . The golden , shimmering exterior of the kingdom melts away , revealing something ordinary , and Aoyama ($_aoyama) is like the black hole to the fake glamour . The golden exterior is all attracted towards him ($_iida) in the form of light , and he ($_iida) can t help but smile . I think we should be leaving this challenge , don t you ? It s absolutely dreadful . For once , he ($_iida) s really not being fake . He ($_iida) takes a look around at the normal kingdom and smiles . Because it brings more comfort than him ($_iida) than the grand one ever could have . 
He ($_iida) turns on his ($_iida) heel so he ($_iida) s facing the door again and walks out , right past the two previous challengers . He ($_iida) can feel eyes on him ($_iida) as the footsteps behind him ($_iida) echo through the falls , and he ($_iida) grins to himself ($_iida) . This , somehow is exactly what he ($_iida) wanted . 
Getting everyone out is easy - as soon as the group has joined up again , they re back in the hallway , and Aoyama ($_aoyama) has not , in fact , stopped glowing . The others have a faint glow around them too , Iida ($_iida) s being blue and Kirishima ($_kirishima) s being scarlet , but neither are as bright as his ($_iida) own . 
Everyone in the company sans Bakugou thanks him ($_iida) and apologizes for their behavior , and he ($_iida) feels so appreciated , but what s even better is that after they ve decided to go to sleep before continuing to the next challenge , Iida ($_iida) approaches him ($_iida) . Aoyama ($_aoyama) ! 
His ($_iida) voice is loud , and it almost makes Aoyama ($_aoyama) laugh . No matter how many times he ($_iida) hears it , something about the insistent volume is funny to him ($_iida) . Yes , Iida ($_iida) ? You ve already apologized , you know , there s no reason for you to do so again . Aoyama ($_aoyama) searches his ($_aoyama) face for any kind of emotion and he ($_aoyama) finds guilt , which makes him ($_aoyama) wince . Iida ($_iida) , I ($_iida) know it wasn t really you . I ($_iida) ve forgiven you , so won t you accept that ? In contrast to Iida , his ($_aoyama) voice is soft , and he ($_aoyama) hopes it s comforting . 
Iida ($_iida) still looks guilty , no matter how much Aoyama ($_aoyama) tries to get him ($_iida) to stop , so he ($_iida) just lets the knight speak . If there is anything I ($_iida) can do to repay you - Aoyama ($_aoyama) s eyes twinkle as he ($_iida) holds a hand up to silence him ($_iida) . That s a very dangerous offer . 
He ($_iida) leans up and pressed a chaste kiss to Iida s lips , grinning the whole time . Consider your debt to me ($_iida) repaid ! 
Iida ($_iida) is still a blushing mess by the time Aoyama ($_aoyama) drifts off to sleep , leaning on him ($_iida) .
