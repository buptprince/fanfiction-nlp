It s in the paper . About the small village burning in the south . The news paper says in big bold letters , 
NO SURVIVORS . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) wants to cry . Wants to fall down and cry because it s true . It s true and everyone is dead and he ran away . Again. Another time of running away whilst everyone around him dies and he doesn t do a single damn thing . They were all dead . All of them , not a single survivor and - and - 
He thinks , to Bakugou saying they came and he thinks , he thinks about what they were after in the first place . What caught their attention in the first place . Of the stories he told that were a bit more true than fantasy and of Bakugou ($_bakugou) charging into his ($_bakugou) life and saying that they were going to kill him ($_bakugou) . 
The village , his ($_bakugou) home - his ($_bakugou) home was gone . Up in flames yet again and , and , 
Die . 
He ($_bakugou) hears a door slamming and the last hissed word of frustration echoing in his ($_bakugou) mind over and over again and he ($_bakugou) feels the news paper in his ($_bakugou) hands with the big bold letters of NO SURVIVORS and he ($_bakugou) thinks , 
He ($_bakugou) thinks he ($_bakugou) s going to die because the_person_who_was_helping_him ($_bakugou) him ($_bakugou) is gone . Gone and no longer in reach and he ($_bakugou) still doesn t know anything . 
He ($_bakugou) s , he ($_bakugou) s going to die and he ($_bakugou) s not going to be able to do anything to prevent it .

He ($_bakugou) makes it to two weeks and another town before his ($_bakugou) word turns upside down . Upside down in the form of a boy donned in riches with a sword at his ($_bakugou) hip and too soft green eyes . Upside down in the form of one Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) . 
It s in the morning , he ($_bakugou) had just sat down for breakfast - some healthy meal of eggs and bacon and maybe some burnt hash browns too because he ($_bakugou) never really got the hang of fixing those . So he ($_bakugou) s sitting , fork in hand and ready to eat as much as his ($_bakugou) steadily shrinking stomach can handle when someone just sits right across from him ($_bakugou) with this small nervous little smile . They lift up a gloved hand , a metal gauntlet glinting challengingly and in the brightest voice Eijirou ($_eijirou) has heard in a long time said , Good morning . I am Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) and I was hoping you could help with something ? 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) just stared at him ($_bakugou) , fork half way to his ($_bakugou) mouth and eyes wide open . 
There is this choked chuckle that comes out of Midoriya s throat , something horrible forced and the smile is twitching with nerves but his ($_bakugou) hand stays steady as it is offered to Eijirou . Eijirou blinks once , twice , before slow lifting his ($_bakugou) hand that s not holding the fork with eggs stuck at the end and - 
The shake is all kinds of awkward , more like two dead fish encountering each other than an actual hand shake and both are quick to retreat . Eijirou ($_eijirou) is still holding that fork close to his ($_bakugou) mouth and as soon as he ($_bakugou) realizes that his ($_bakugou) hand was frozen in air still he ($_bakugou) drops the fork like it burned him ($_bakugou) . Another pause , something suffocating and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s smile is back to being this small , bright and blinding little thing that Eijirou ($_eijirou) can t really look at . 
Uh . His ($_bakugou) voice breaks before any words escape , mind unable to actually boot up from its previous frozen state . Eijirou ($_eijirou) swallows , squints his ($_bakugou) eyes and braves that bright little smile pointed his ($_bakugou) way with the soft green eyes beaming at him ($_bakugou) with hopefulness . Hopeful for what , Eijirou ($_eijirou) didn t know . Er . What - Can you repeat yourself . A pause because that sounded too demanding , or something . He ($_bakugou) s just having flashbacks really , of the ticking bomb that d spit out questions like demands and he ($_bakugou) s quick to add , Please ? because he ($_bakugou) doesn t want to compare himself ($_bakugou) to the other . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) goes red , this blooming red from the tips of his ($_midoriya) ears down his ($_midoriya) neck and disappearing underneath shining armor and his ($_midoriya) hand is quick to go to his ($_midoriya) neck as another choked chuckle escapes him ($_midoriya) . Uhm . I was hoping you could help ? With something . Since you re , you know . The boy s free hand is gesturing in the air , as if hoping the motions would explain what his bumbling words could not . 
They didn t. Not really , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) wasn t sure if it would even matter anyways . He opens his mouth , the reply of Sorry , I don t think I ll be able to help at the tip of his tongue because there is no way he , homeless , on the run Eijirou , could be of any help . Not when he doesn t know anything , not when the words NO SURVIVORS still burn in the back of his mind but - 
But-
He sees those bright , too soft green eyes filled with hope and those words can t escape into the air . They choke as they retreat back down and all thoughts of useless and can t and everyone dies vanish into thin air and he s left with this small hope that maybe , just maybe it can change . Maybe this is what he can do , instead of just living in another town all over again and hiding and sure - maybe it won t be helping him but - 
But does he really deserved to be help ? 
NO SURVIVORS still shines brightly in the back of his mind as he asks , What - what do you need help with ? A cautious question , but the one that flips everything upside down as the widest smile spreads across Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , eyes glowing with happiness .

Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) is a knight . A small one perhaps with no actual title to his name because he followed a King that truly had nothing , but he was a knight none the less . At least , that s what Eijirou ($_eijirou) thought . Eijirou ($_eijirou) thought that anyone who would risk their life for someone else over and over again deserved the title of knight . And that s what Midoriya ($_midoriya) was doing , he ($_midoriya) was risking his ($_midoriya) life for his ($_midoriya) nameless little King because his ($_midoriya) king was dying by something that nobody but someone with magic could cure . 
And , and magic was outlawed . A practice that society did not allow anymore without dire repercussions and looking for magic was a death sentence . But here Midoriya ($_midoriya) was , with his ($_midoriya) shiny armor and his ($_midoriya) soft green eyes and his ($_midoriya) freckles and his ($_midoriya) bright smile - risking his ($_midoriya) life to find magic to save his ($_midoriya) precious king . 
And then there was Eijirou , the only survivor of one of the last villages that lived with , and for and because of , magic . Eijirou who once upon a time had the magic that Midoriya ($_midoriya) so desperately searches for . Eijirou who no longer knows the simplest spell , who can no longer reach for any kind of magic because it s been so long and he s buried it for so long because he can still hear the screams of the beasts and dragons being slain . Can still feel the burn of flames scorching his skin . Can hear oh so clearly the hissed words , 
This is all your fucking fault . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) , once again is unable to do anything . Is left telling the knight that tries so hard to save their nameless king that - that he can t help . That he s sorry but I can t do magic and Midoriya ($_midoriya) wilts like a flower in the coldest winter . Wilts and his eyes become these dull lifeless orbs and Eijirou ($_eijirou) hates it . So he says , he says he can try though . If that s what Midoriya ($_midoriya) truly wants . Midoriya ($_midoriya) looks up , gives the smallest smile and asks , 
Please? You are my last hope .

One day the boy found a hatchling . Some small child with fur instead of scales and no legs . A worm really - a furry little worm that was black as night with large emerald eyes that would watch carefully . The lizard looked at the pathetic little hatchling , stuck up its nose before turning red eyes to the boy and telling the boy , 
Do not trust the worm who takes . He will destroy us and take everything from you if you do . We do not need him , nor do I want him here . 
As all fairy tales go , the boy did not heed the lizards words .
