This is not the first time Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) has taken control of Fumikage s body , but it ($_shadow) s the first time he s done it ($_shadow) by force . 
The two of them live in harmony , supporting one another , though Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) knows he annoys Fumikage ($_fumikage) more than anything on some occasions . Not once has Dark Shadow forcefully taken control before now . In his defense , though , it s urgent . 
Fumikage ($_fumikage) may practice dark magic , and that may have been what had brought Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) about in the first place , but he s not immune to it ($_shadow) the way the spirit is . And , the_shadow ($_shadow) knows dark magic when he feels it ($_shadow) . If he hadn t taken control , Fumikage ($_fumikage) would be sobbing on the ground like the rest of the Company . He ll get Fumikage ($_fumikage) to thank him later , when he s in control again . 
Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) looks around at the rest of the company . He s not tempted to help them , because he knows they ll be fine anyway . There s a chance they will go insane , of course , but he s not going to let that happens . They should be free as long as he gets to the Cloak in time , and he s positive there will be nothing stopping him . Ordinarily , the Peaceful Darkness drives the challengers insane before they can reach the crown , but with Fumikage trapped deep inside his mind , he s completely immune . He gives the company one last look before walking off in the direction that feels right to him . 
For a long while , there is nothing . There s only an empty void of a kind of dark that almost feels alive . To Dark Shadow , it s sinister , but it can t get near him . And then , he hears them . 
Voices start to whisper , inside of his head and out of it . He briefly wonders is this is what the others are hearing , what s making them like this . If he were human , Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) certainly would have been down on that floor too . Fumikage ($_fumikage) would be there . The_shadow ($_shadow) s host can pretend all he wants , but he can see into the bird-headed man s mind . He sees the loneliness , the longing for other humans to be near . It s hard to miss . 
He shakes himself free of those thoughts just in time to notice that the darkness is moving . 
At first , he s sure it is an illusion . After all , though Fumikage ($_fumikage) s spell gave him amazing eyes along with the head of a bird , they re still nothing compared to what Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) can see with his true form . But then the dark continues to move until he can see figures of people . 
He doesn t even need to look at them to know who they are , but the sight isn t the most unhelpful thing there could be . After all , former challengers who wore the cloak may have left with their lives , but there s always a part of people lost to the darkness once they get themselves too far into it . 
Standing at the front of the small horde is who Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) knows as the most recent challenger , although that was still nearly a century ago . His name has been lost to time already , because it s never been recorded , but his appearance has . The long black hair and tired eyes are the same as the ones in books that Fumikage ($_fumikage) owns , except this version of him looks monochrome and almost rotting . That figures . It s been a long time since anyone was here . 
He doesn t get more time to point out the other challengers . The one at the front raises his hand and the darkness moves again , made of something far more dangerous than just a lack of light . It surrounds Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) , keeping him rooted to the spot as it tries to crush him with thoughts of unhappiness and dread . If Fumikage ($_fumikage) were the one controlling this body , then perhaps that would have worked . Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) isn t affected , though . 
Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) is a creature of darkness . He s something that s made of these same fears , something that appeared to fill in what the dark magic took from Fumikage ($_fumikage) . All those years ago , that spell was supposed to rid him of negative emotions , but it s not possible to leave something like that behind , so Dark Shadow had arrived to fill that place . 
He keeps upright easily , walks in the dark with his head high , and it seems to part around him when he shows this sort of confidence . It makes way for what he s been looking for . In the middle of the void , hanging in the air , is the Cloak . The whispers , the shadows , the dread - it all stops once he gets close to the artifact . He s tempted to reach out and grab it , but the Cloak isn t his to take . 
He recedes back into Fumikage ($_fumikage) s mind and lets the real challenger take over again . 
Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) is aware of what has been happening , but the sight of the cloak in front of him ($_tokoyami) is sort of a lot to take in . He ($_tokoyami) hesitates for just a moment before reaching out and grabbing the cloak , then easily slipping it onto himself ($_tokoyami) . For just a second , he ($_tokoyami) s filled with the sense of immense power , and it really does make him ($_tokoyami) want to laugh , but then he ($_tokoyami) turns his ($_tokoyami) head . 
The previous challengers are back , and they look more sinister than the picture Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) mentally gave him ($_tokoyami) . They re running , actually , towards him ($_tokoyami) , and Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) isn t the one who pulls his ($_tokoyami) arm up and sends the darkness forward . He ($_tokoyami) can hear a sort of triumphant laughter coming from Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) . He ($_tokoyami) d thank his ($_tokoyami) shadow if he ($_tokoyami) wasn t so annoyed . He ($_tokoyami) could have done that himself ($_tokoyami) , but it doesn t matter . They re safe now . 
It gets lighter the more he ($_tokoyami) backtracks down the road , and he ($_tokoyami) s met with tear-stained faces when the group reunites with him ($_tokoyami) . As he ($_tokoyami) expects , it s only an instant before they re back in the tower and people are drying their eyes , laughing because it s over and telling eachother how awful their thoughts had been . Everything is normal . 
People thank Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , tell him ($_tokoyami) that he ($_tokoyami) did a good job , and Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) takes the credit for it , because he ($_tokoyami) can t tell people about Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) if he ($_tokoyami) wants them to see him ($_tokoyami) the same . Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) doesn t mind , anyway , because he ($_tokoyami) knows Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) appreciates him ($_tokoyami) and that is apparently enough for him ($_tokoyami) . 
Later , though , on the way to the next challenge , he ($_tokoyami) ends up revealing his ($_tokoyami) secret . 
You re not acting like someone who fucking took down the challenge , asshole . What the hell is wrong with you ?! Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) s voice is more accusing than usual . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) sees no reason to lie if he ($_tokoyami) was asked directly , so his ($_tokoyami) response is more straightforward than anything else he ($_tokoyami) s said so far . 
It wasn t me . I have a spirit called Dark Shadow who lives inside of me . He ($_tokoyami) braved the darkness . Bakugou ($_bakugou) looks at him ($_tokoyami) strangely , but he ($_tokoyami) expected that . You wanted the truth , and I gave it to you . Is that not okay? 
That only angers Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Everything angers him ($_tokoyami) , apparently , so Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) doesn t bother apologizing for what he ($_tokoyami) s said . It s fine , it s just fucking weird . 
Bakugou doesn t stop conversing with him ($_tokoyami) , though , which is odd . Bakugou ($_bakugou) is an odd person in general , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) finds . He ($_tokoyami) d thought at first that the_angry_man ($_tokoyami) had no morals , had no way of distinguishing right from wrong , but it s clear to him ($_tokoyami) now after a while of somewhat deep conversation that he ($_tokoyami) was incorrect . He ($_tokoyami) watches Bakugou ($_bakugou) leave to walk on his ($_tokoyami) own , only to be pestered by his ($_tokoyami) self-proclaimed friends again . Observing the interaction more closely before , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) realizes that while Bakugou ($_bakugou) may be acting like he ($_tokoyami) doesn t want them around , he ($_tokoyami) s not pushing them away , and he ($_tokoyami) s even engaging in conversation . Maybe he ($_tokoyami) has found someone as unknowingly lonely as him ($_tokoyami) , after all . 
He ($_tokoyami) stifles a quiet laugh as Kaminari says something to anger Bakugou ($_bakugou) , causing more yelling from the latter . 
In the midst of a group that he ($_tokoyami) did not fucking ask to be a part of , a runaway wonders when he ($_tokoyami) ll get his ($_tokoyami) chance to shine .
