Kaminari_Denki ($_kaminari) is not an idiot , despite what some people might think . 
Sure , he ($_kaminari) doesn t have the most common sense and sure , he ($_kaminari) s kind of impulsive and reckless , but that doesn t make him ($_kaminari) stupid . In his ($_kaminari) opinion , he ($_kaminari) s just fun . That doesn t stop other people from making fun of him ($_kaminari) when they think he ($_kaminari) can t hear , though . 
Kaminari ($_kaminari) knows he ($_kaminari) s bound to hear things like that , though . He ($_kaminari) s a bard , he ($_kaminari) spreads gossip to everyone with his ($_kaminari) stories . It s practically his ($_kaminari) job to hear rumors . He ($_kaminari) just wishes that people would be less of an asshole about things like that . He ($_kaminari) s got emotions too , he ($_kaminari) s not always the lighthearted jokester . 
When he ($_kaminari) was chosen to be a part of the Company , he ($_kaminari) d hoped the rumors would light up . But as he ($_kaminari) d passed out of his ($_kaminari) village , the townspeople staring him ($_kaminari) down as he ($_kaminari) did so , their quiet whispers weren t inaudible to him ($_kaminari) . But , since he ($_kaminari) didn t want to leave the town angry , he ($_kaminari) d kept a grin on his ($_kaminari) face as he ($_kaminari) walked away , guitar slinged across his ($_kaminari) back as if that d do him ($_kaminari) any good in any sort of fight . 
Kaminari ($_kaminari) s been chosen as a Challenger ? the townspeople had asked , and Kaminari ($_kaminari) can hear their voices in his head even now , though they re more faint than they had been that day . I really pity the Company , in that case . He s bound to mess it up . 
The thoughts bring a scowl to his face , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) stops what he s doing to ask , Hey , dude , you okay ? Of course , he nods . He doesn t want to worry everyone over something stupid , after all . You re kinda glaring . Oh. He didn t know that . 
His face flushes . Uh , yeah ! I m totally cool right now , no need to worry about me ! He closes his eyes and curses mentally for fucking that up . Hey , wan na hear a story ? That seems to divert Kirishima ($_kirishima) s attention from his sudden change in mood , and Kaminari ($_kaminari) sighs in relief . Okay. Imagine a world in the future where everybody has their own kind of magic . . 
He trails off , letting the fantasy world envelop him before he continues talking , unaware of the many people tuning in to listen . There s no tower , there s no quest to save the world , but there s a group of ten that s a lot like this one . In his mind he sees blue skies and fire , and forests and caves . It all starts with a peasant who accidentally pulled a legendary sword from a stone . Not even the bravest knights could do it , but he managed to . He imagines a faceless person with curly green hair wielding a sword , guided by the spirit of someone who came before him . 
Our peasant , on his way to learn to use the sword s power , meets many people . His first encounter is with an accomplished knight . Green-haired boy meets someone with nicely kept blue hair and square glasses . He has the power of speed , and together they get through the lands quicker . Then the peasant meets a prince . He imagines someone with hair that is half red and half white , a scar adorning his face . His power is special . He has two . He can make things cold with one side and make things hot with the other . 
His mind s eye shows him more people . He names each person as he thinks of them . A redheaded thief with the power to harden his body . A blonde prince that can release light from his body and a necromancer with a powerful darkness inside of him . An advisor who can create anything , a cursed girl with the power to create acid , and a bard with the power of electricity . 
The nine of them team up to go and find someone who s been rumored to be very powerful that might be able to help the peasant become a knight . But , when they find him , they get someone temperamental and who acts like a child . He has the power of explosions . He imagines someone strong and someone stubborn , with ashy blonde hair and bright red eyes and he knows who this is that he s thinking of , whereas everyone else was different enough for him to not notice what he was picturing . Now that he realizes , he has a more solid grasp on where the story is going . 
The necromancer is the last person to try and convince him to join the group , and to his surprise , it works . Kaminari ($_kaminari) has noticed Tokoyami hanging around Bakugou lately . So they set off again . The blonde prince overused his power earlier trying to fight off the rogue s dragon , so the knight is carrying him on his back . He glances around for another hint of anything . The advisor and the cursed girl are talking to eachother while lagging behind the rest of the group . The other prince is speaking in hushed tones to the peasant . There s some degree of hesitance before he continues . The bard and the thief are joking around together , pressed close as if they don t want anyone to hear . 
Saying it aloud is embarrassing , but Kaminari ($_kaminari) presses on , continuing to give more details . The group , of course , is led to victory . Midoriya The peasant becomes a knight at one of the most renowned kingdoms in the world , and the group stays together for the rest of their days , because Kaminari ($_kaminari) refuses to give anyone a happy ending . He ($_kaminari) leaves his ($_kaminari) story off with a nod and then there are people telling him ($_kaminari) how nice that was . Aoyama comments that he ($_kaminari) likes the blonde prince while he ($_kaminari) clings to Iida , who looks like he ($_kaminari) also wants to compliment Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Even Todoroki , who s said less than three words to anyone from what he ($_kaminari) s seen , is giving him ($_kaminari) a look as if he ($_kaminari) s done something right . 
He ($_kaminari) s just happy they all liked his ($_kaminari) story . It doesn t take a lot to come up with them , because he ($_kaminari) likes to go with the flow , but it still feels nice when people congratulate him ($_kaminari) on a story well told . It s especially satisfying , however , when Kirishima ($_kirishima) tells him ($_kaminari) that this is his ($_kaminari) favorite story so far . 
They ve been walking in a distracted cluster for so long that , until now , Kaminari ($_kaminari) failed to notice the static electricity buildup in the air . He ($_kaminari) suppresses a groan . The challenges are so scary , and it s not like he ($_kaminari) gets to do anything anyways . He ($_kaminari) s not going to complain aloud , though , not when he ($_kaminari) s just lightened the mood with his ($_kaminari) story . 
The rest of the way to the doors is filled with a comfortable silence , with only whispers here and there . Kaminari ($_kaminari) usually doesn t like silence , but he ($_kaminari) can tolerate this , especially if he ($_kaminari) s walking next to Kirishima and their hands are almost brushing against eachother , and - 
We re here . Right. Midoriya ($_midoriya) s voice cuts through his ($_midoriya) fantasies like a sharp knife , but he ($_midoriya) doesn t blame the Bearer for anything . 
He ($_midoriya) reaches out and touches the seal , electricity shocking his ($_midoriya) hand for a second before they re all pulled out of the room again , and an uncomfortable amount of electricity buildup jolts his ($_midoriya) body . He ($_midoriya) hopes this is his ($_midoriya) challenge so he ($_midoriya) doesn t have to suffer too much . 
The Rumble of Thunder roars around the group , as lightning flashes in so many places at once .
