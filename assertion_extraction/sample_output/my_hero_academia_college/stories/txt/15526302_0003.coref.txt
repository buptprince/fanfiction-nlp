Ch .3 - Vulpes pilum mutat , non mores 
You can t be mad at me for this I have other responsibilities . Ones more important then taking the time out of my day to visit you . He spoke , his voice that of an scolding father . 
Though he was in no way her father rather her own brother who once more was making up excuses for his own lack of care towards her . The girl who pouted near him turned her head , looking away and holding her head up high . 
I don t care ! You promised ! She cried out , pointing an accusing finger at him . You said you d come and you didn t ! 
The_male ($_kirishima) sighed , shaking his ($_kirishima) head . He ($_kirishima) collected the items he ($_kirishima) had brought for her , the box of teas he ($_kirishima) assumed she d enjoy from his ($_kirishima) latest outing into one of the larger trading centers tucked back into his ($_kirishima) own bag . 
Listen I m not the only one who has better and more important matters to attend to you do too . So if you re not going to appreciate the time I m giving you now well you can stay here and be mad by yourself . 
He ($_kirishima) got up , grabbing his ($_kirishima) things and walking towards the door . He ($_kirishima) paused , looking back at the girl who hadn t moved at all . Her face still sour and her eyes stern and angry at him ($_kirishima) . He ($_kirishima) sighed , shaking his ($_kirishima) head and closing the door behind him ($_kirishima) as he ($_kirishima) left . 
The girl merely gripped her hands together , her fingernails digging viciously into her skin as she attempted to control the pain inside of her chest . All he ($_kirishima) ever spoke of now was being responsible and accepting the role she was born into . 
But he ($_kirishima) couldn t tie her down to this none of them could . And eventually she d do whatever the hell she pleased and would never have to bend over for their whims and desires again . 
And when she did it would be he ($_kirishima) who would have to beg her to come and see him ($_kirishima) . 
~~~~~
Your ($_kirishima) eyes fluttered open , your ($_kirishima) cheeks feeling slightly damp from the memory that had suddenly appeared again in your ($_kirishima) mind . One so pushed back that you ($_kirishima) had wished it stayed there . The emotional implications of such a memory was what worried you ($_kirishima) as you ($_kirishima) had refused to think about life from before . 
For now and forever it was only you ($_kirishima) and you ($_kirishima) alone . It had been that way for a while anyway and you ($_kirishima) enjoyed it with all your ($_kirishima) heart . With no one around , you ($_kirishima) could do as you ($_kirishima) pleased , and most importantly you ($_kirishima) could do all the things you ($_kirishima) should have done and deserved to do . And just because you ($_kirishima) did them alone in no way meant you ($_kirishima) were a lonely being at heart . Sometimes isolation was good ! Sometimes being on your ($_kirishima) own was the best of times . 
Oh hey , you ($_kirishima) re awake ! 
The voice shattered your ($_kirishima) ideas of solitude as it bounced off the wooden and fabric walls surrounding you ($_kirishima) . Your ($_kirishima) eyes immediately falling on a male who was resting on a pile of pillows not too far away from you ($_kirishima) . His red hair glistening in the dim lighting from a flame or two scattered along the room . On his lap sat a board , a piece of paper and ink on it with various scribbles sprawled across . 
The red eyed male seemed to take notice of your ($_kirishima) wandering and untrustworthy eyes on him , and while he was thankful you ($_kirishima) didn t scream when he made his presence know he knew he should try and give you ($_kirishima) a bit more of a proper welcome if not an explanation . 
He cleared his throat , rising to his feet and walking towards you ($_kirishima) . With a wide and friendly grin that shone brighter than the fire lights in the room , he held out his hand towards you ($_kirishima) . You ($_kirishima) watched him carefully , instead rising to your ($_kirishima) feet on your ($_kirishima) own . The male retracted his hand , not seeming hurt at all that you ($_kirishima) denied his help to bring you ($_kirishima) to your ($_kirishima) feet once more . 
How are you ($_kirishima) feeling ? He asked you ($_kirishima) , knowing he should at least ask this before moving on to names and where you ($_kirishima) were . 
Just fine . You ($_kirishima) told him , lightly touching your ($_kirishima) face and seeing as the pain caused by the rocks and the cuts and bruises they had made were gone . So it 's true then 
You ($_kirishima) re aware of the the - ? The strange red haired male spoke . 
Life halt . You ($_kirishima) finished for him . I ($_kirishima) m a. . . travelling merchant so I ve seen quite a lot about the land . And out of it all watching a man get his head cut off in a duel and then not die definitely is in the top three . 
The pair of carmine eyes widened , a hand running through his spiked locks in an attempt to calm himself down . Holy crap and I thought seeing that boar not die from getting impaled was nauseating 
He seemed to quickly come back to the topic at hand however and with another glance or two at your ($_kirishima) form he evaluated you ($_kirishima) once more . Well how about your ($_kirishima) mental health ? You ($_kirishima) remember what happened right ? Your ($_kirishima) name ? No confusion or anything , right ? 
No aside from my confusion as to how you ($_kirishima) are able to speak the common tongue ? You ($_kirishima) asked him . Despite his fluency in the most spoken and widely used language of Alcius , you ($_kirishima) could tell by the slight accent that the redhead had that it was not his native tongue . 
Oh it was taught to me . I m trying to learn how to write and read it as well . Though I m not really good at it right now . He rubbed the back of his neck while you ($_kirishima) gazed down to the paper he had been attempting to practice on . 
The room grew silent for a few moments and as the male glanced over towards you ($_kirishima) , he was surprised to see you ($_kirishima) staring at him . Seeming to take him in and study him like he was a rare specimen to you ($_kirishima) but then again , he was from Tineen . 
Kirishima Eijirou . He held out his hand . Glad to see you ($_kirishima) re okay . Sorry about before we didn t mean to spook you ($_kirishima) so much . 
You ($_kirishima) gave him a strange look , raising a brow . Have we met before ? 
He blinked , pink raising to his cheeks when he realized his own mistake . Letting out an embarrassed laugh , he waved you ($_kirishima) off . You ($_kirishima) were not from here after all so it was more than likely the first time you ($_kirishima) had met someone like him as he was pretty rare . 
I ($_kirishima) was well the dragon ? He questioned his words , but you ($_kirishima) seemed to understand enough . 
Your ($_kirishima) eyes fell to the mark exposed on his right shoulder , the connection being made right away . And as you ($_kirishima) took Kirishima ($_kirishima) in once more , you ($_kirishima) seemed to see it as well : cherry red hair that would change into cherry red scales and ruby eyes that went from reptilian to mammalian depending on his form . 
You ($_kirishima) are one of Cercan s kin , aren t you ($_kirishima) ? You ($_kirishima) asked him , though your ($_kirishima) words appeared to speak with confidence . 
He nodded . Yeah but shifting between human and dragon isn t the type of magic I learned . I m actually biologically a half dragon . 
Interesting You ($_kirishima) muttered , looking downward . 
A member of the God of Form and Peace he certainly seemed to fit the bill . He seemed calm and gave off the aura of wanting to keep things civil and friendly . And since he was a half-dragon , one of the cross species that was able to possess two forms and a half form no wonder he was claimed by such a being . It actually made you ($_kirishima) wonder what sort of body altering magic he did learn 
Your ($_kirishima) thoughts were cut short however when you ($_kirishima) noticed something missing from your ($_kirishima) attire . Your ($_kirishima) eyes widening , you ($_kirishima) began to search for the object between the layers of clothing you ($_kirishima) had on your ($_kirishima) top . And when still not found , you ($_kirishima) checked your ($_kirishima) short s pockets . It all appeared barren and empty . 
Is everything okay ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked you ($_kirishima) , seeing the panic rise on your ($_kirishima) face . 
N-no I m missing something very important ! You ($_kirishima) told him . 
Oh right! He suddenly snapped his fingers , making you ($_kirishima) glance at him . 
You ($_kirishima) watched as he took out what you ($_kirishima) were looking for from his pocket . The long chained piece of jewelry swung as the serpent dangled at its bottom . The animal black and white in color and having matching eyes , but swapped on the opposite sides . The half-dragon gave you ($_kirishima) an apologetic smile and handed it back over to you ($_kirishima) . 
The healers removed it , as they didn t want to harm something that looked to be special to you ($_kirishima) He spoke , watching as you ($_kirishima) snatched it back . 
You ($_kirishima) quickly put the pendant back on , tucking it below your ($_kirishima) clothing and next to your ($_kirishima) heart once more . Out of sight and mind but still present . Just how you ($_kirishima) liked it . 
Why was I ($_kirishima) being healed ? Minor injuries are immediately reversed after they set in only the major and life threatening remain , after all . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled lightly . Well our tribe leader wanted to make sure . And if you ($_kirishima) were in serious harm she wanted to make sure you ($_kirishima) had the best healers in Tineen ($_tineen) by your ($_kirishima) side . 
Ignoring his comment about how you ($_kirishima) were in Tineen ($_tineen) , more than likely in their own capital city , you ($_kirishima) focused on the next part of his speech that seem strange to you ($_kirishima) . And with another suspicious glance at the dragon that had been put in charge of watching over you ($_kirishima) you ($_kirishima) spoke . 
Why would your ($_kirishima) land s leader want to take special care of me ($_kirishima) ? 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked away from you ($_kirishima) , an unsure look on his ($_kirishima) features and a sigh escaping his ($_kirishima) lips . Well cause her son was the reason you ($_kirishima) nearly fell off a cliff . 
That neanderthal is the tribe leader s son ? 
Yeah Chief ($_chief) and he ($_chief) had quite the screaming match when we brought you ($_kirishima) back 
Before you ($_kirishima) could question the scarlet dragon further , the entrance way to the room you ($_kirishima) were in was opened . The room itself was much different then Highar s own , as rather than stone , the room was made of wood and what appeared to be thin water and fireproof materials . The heat being kept out which was needed in this volcanic like place and the entrance , where the newest figure entered in , being a single flap that allowed a breeze to flow through leisurely . 
A male dressed in a familiar outfit appeared , only the mask he ($_chief) had been wearing was now resting in one of the hands near his ($_chief) side . He ($_chief) paused seeing his ($_chief) dragon and the strange girl making talk amongst each other in the leader s guest quarters of all places . 
The_male_with_ash_blonde_haired ($_bakugou) turned to the red haired dragon , opening his ($_bakugou) lips and saying something in the same language he ($_bakugou) had been screaming at you ($_kirishima) in before . His ($_bakugou) tone was still harsh , if not annoyed . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) shook his ($_bakugou) head , speaking back in the same tongue . He ($_bakugou) gently gestured to you ($_kirishima) and then down at the paper he ($_bakugou) had been writing on . The ash blonde looking at it as well and letting out a smug noise before looking at you ($_kirishima) . 
He ($_bakugou) spoke to you ($_kirishima) once more , this time muttering the same word he ($_bakugou) had spoken to you ($_kirishima) before , along with a few more . 
So this is the idiot that came into Tineen ($_tineen) , doesn t speak a damn lick of the language and then nearly fell off a fucking cliff 
He ($_bakugou) turned his ($_bakugou) back to you ($_kirishima) , picking up the paper Kirishima ($_kirishima) had previously been writing on . His ($_bakugou) face morphed into a frown and with a sudden flick of his ($_bakugou) fingers and a soft glow from the mark on his ($_bakugou) right shoulder , the entire thing went up in flames . 
Shitty hair if you ($_kirishima) wan na write the common language , you ($_kirishima) have to work on your ($_kirishima) damn penmanship . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled awkwardly again . Yeah yeah I know , Bakugou ($_bakugou) anyway don t you ($_kirishima) have something to say to - 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s face paled , looking at you ($_kirishima) . Oh man I forgot to ask for your ($_kirishima) name 
Just call me -LRB- Name -RRB- . You ($_kirishima) instructed the two males . 
Great! Well -LRB- Name -RRB- , Bakugou ($_bakugou) here has been ordered by our chief to tell you ($_kirishima) something . 
You ($_kirishima) looked towards the ash blonde who was pretty much the equivalent to this land s prince . And while Tineen ($_tineen) had its own way of doing things if the almost prince wanted to be king he d need to defeat the current chief in a duel . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) clicked his ($_bakugou) tongue . If all outsiders are as fucking stupid as you ($_kirishima) then I m grateful people stay the hell out of our territory 
You ($_kirishima) looked at him in shock , your ($_kirishima) eyes widening . Kirishima ($_kirishima) seemed just as shocked as this was not the apology that the chief had ordered her son to make in her meeting room a few hours ago . Leave it ($_kirishima) to Bakugou ($_bakugou) to do this own thing and blow off his mother though 
B-Bakugou Kirishima tried to reason with the unruly blonde . 
I should expect no less from a member of that kin . You ($_kirishima) spoke with disgust , eyeing the Arus mark . 
What? Bakugou ($_bakugou) seemed to get ticked off . You ($_kirishima) got a damn problem with my God ? 
You ($_kirishima) didn t answer him , simply looking away . Your ($_kirishima) lack of eye contact seeming to only make the male angier , his shoulder beginning to ignite in a bright glow . Before he could erupt at you ($_kirishima) though , the dragon dragged him out . 
You ($_kirishima) walked around the room , taking in the various objects and finding your ($_kirishima) own possessions as you ($_kirishima) heard the two males talking to each other outside in their native language . If you ($_kirishima) were to guess you ($_kirishima) d assume that Bakugou ($_bakugou) was Kirishima ($_kirishima) s rider . 
Meaning either Bakugou ($_bakugou) had more merit to him then you ($_kirishima) thought , which allowed a dragon to choose him as its rider or Kirishima ($_kirishima) had made an ill informed choice and was stuck with the hothead . And you ($_kirishima) were not guessing the former 
After a few moments , the pair entered once more . Bakugou_holding_a_nasty ($_holding) scowl on that already rough looking face of his ($_holding) . And Kirishima ($_kirishima) giving you ($_kirishima) some apologetic eyes . You ($_kirishima) turned around , grabbing your ($_kirishima) plump bag and hoisted it off the ground . 
Well thanks for healing me and well letting me know that some of the rumors about Tineen aren t true . Your ($_kirishima) tone harsher as you ($_kirishima) glanced at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . But I should get going . 
Going? Kirishima ($_kirishima) flashed you ($_kirishima) a sad look . Are you ($_kirishima) sure , we can host you ($_kirishima) for the_night ($_the) . 
You ($_kirishima) shook your ($_kirishima) head towards the half-dragon , pointing to your ($_kirishima) bag and winking at him . Kirishima ($_kirishima) seemed to understand what you ($_kirishima) were saying . As a merchant , you ($_kirishima) must have a lot of deadlines to meet with trading and delivering the objects and items people requested of you ($_kirishima) after all . 
Thank you ($_kirishima) for your ($_kirishima) kindness and hospitality for the most part . You ($_kirishima) bowed politely , turning to the two males who were standing near you ($_kirishima) . But I should be heading out though . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) s lips curled into a frown , seeing as the_night ($_the) was beginning to stretch onto the horizon . His own worries making him wish you ($_kirishima) d stay the night at least , as the wilderness outside of the main city could be fairly rough especially for someone like you ($_kirishima) who seemed to not know where she was going . A wanderer like yourself ($_kirishima) could find serious trouble more then almost running off a cliff . 
Any chance I can convince you ($_kirishima) to stay the_night ($_the) ? The half-dragon offered again , his red eyes seeming to act more like a small dog then a fiery beast . He couldn t help it though he tended to worry about others quite frequently , even those he just met . 
You ($_kirishima) shook your ($_kirishima) head , your ($_kirishima) newly stitched together bag going on your ($_kirishima) back and giving the boys a small wave as you ($_kirishima) turned to single flap that was acting like a door to the hut . A duo pair of vivid scarlet watching as your ($_kirishima) form disappeared from their view a moment later , the sounds of someone walking away fading out the longer the seconds ticked by . 
She was certainly interesting . Kirishima ($_kirishima) muttered , turning towards Bakugou who was still watching , as if he ($_kirishima) could still see you ($_kirishima) from where he ($_kirishima) stood . 
The ash blonde s eyes narrowed as he ($_kirishima) quickly glanced towards the red haired male who was gently yawning next to him ($_kirishima) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s arms raising up towards the space above him ($_kirishima) as he ($_kirishima) stretched out his ($_kirishima) body . Bakugou ($_bakugou) frowned , a face he ($_kirishima) did often make , but one he ($_kirishima) quickly wiped away as he ($_kirishima) had finally figured it out . 
I mean Kirishima ($_kirishima) yawned again through his ($_kirishima) words . I haven t even met anyone like her before her personality and the fact that her shoulder was - 
The dragon stopped , blinking suddenly when he ($_kirishima) realized he ($_kirishima) was alone in the hut . His ($_kirishima) His_chosen_rider ($_kirishima) having disappeared from his ($_kirishima) sight and only a slow flapping entrance allowing the spiky haired man to see exactly where he ($_kirishima) had gone . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) poked his ($_kirishima) head out , looking around him ($_kirishima) as tried to spot the chief s son . Yo Bakugou ? 
The half-dragon sighed , knowing that his ($_kirishima) friend got into more trouble when he ($_kirishima) was off on his ($_kirishima) own than when he ($_kirishima) had someone with him ($_kirishima) . And with the current circumstances of the world and how badly it could go for the male who often resorted to fights the dragon knew he ($_kirishima) had to find him ($_kirishima) . 
He ($_kirishima) wasn t sure what had gotten into him ($_kirishima) but knowing Bakugou ($_bakugou) it was something he ($_kirishima) assumed he ($_kirishima) was justified in seeking out . 
~~~~~
The path in front of you laid dimly lit thanks to stars above you . Tineen ($_tineen) seemed to have many paths disguised as unkept and overgrown trails a wise decision so their people could sneak off and not get lost in the thick woodland . 
You paused , turning to look back at the direction you had come from and saw that the volcanic city was nothing but a distant light away . Even the heat from the heart of the land had dwindled down to tolerable once more . The trees still remained in that tropical style , but with the rise of brush and bushes around , you could tell that more life was able to thrive away from the heart of the land . 
It was a glorious city You muttered to yourself , your smile turning into something more malicious as you swung your bag to the front of you . ... a perfect place to make up for my recent losses . 
You laughed pridefully as you began to go through the things you had pocketed through your little royal tour of the chief s home and gardens . And despite the place not having that same expensive and high class atmosphere that Highar was known for the little jewels , silver and gold pieces and what appeared to be accessories worn by the most decorated members of the tribe were plenty for you . 
Unlike the rumors , turns out the people of Tineen ($_tineen) are awfully kind too bad people like me ($_tineen) seem to love to use it ($_tineen) to their advantage . You sighed , swinging your bag back over and marching forward . 
And where do you think you re going . A voice you had been hoping to have left behind asked you . 
Your feet left the ground a moment later , being held up by nothing but this brute s strength . The ground dangling just under your feet as if you were hovering , though the way you squirmed and tried to break out of his hold proved otherwise . 
Let me ($_tineen) go this instant ! You hollered , but your flailing arms proved to be no match for him . All he had to do was simply adjust his arm and you couldn t touch him or anything . 
Not gonna happen. He clicked his tongue . I knew there was something funny about your bag looked too fucking full 
You eyes narrowed at him , turning enough to see him . His usual strange attire present and his face as sour as when you had first seen it today . Your own lack of consideration for this Tineen citizen in particular had proved that you were still naive . If you had learned anything about males who came from a position of power they were rather smart , and would often figure out your tactics before you could give them the slip . 
Fine . You growled . I m a thief . Congratulations , your highness you figured me out . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) huffed , a sort of chuckle of air escaping his ($_bakugou) lips as he ($_bakugou) lowered you back to the ground . The unimpressed look on his ($_bakugou) face still very much there . If anything it appeared like he ($_bakugou) was still trying to study you like you were the strange creature and not him ($_bakugou) . 
What? You glared at him ($_bakugou) . Gon na stare at me till I give you your stuff back ? 
He ($_bakugou) shrugged , tossing a glance to the side . I honestly don t give a shit about any of that worthless junk . Rather not have it collecting dust . So do whatever the hell you want with it . 
He ($_bakugou) leaned back against a tree that was where he ($_bakugou) had caught up to you and then literally caught you . His ($_bakugou) shoulders relaxing as he ($_bakugou) closed his ($_bakugou) eyes for a moment , simply listening to the sounds of the woods around him ($_bakugou) . 
You watched him ($_bakugou) , trying to figure out what to do or even think of him ($_bakugou) . If he ($_bakugou) didn t care that you took his ($_bakugou) stuff then why was he ($_bakugou) here ? More importantly , why the hell was he ($_bakugou) acting so calm ? From what you saw today he ($_bakugou) was a major jackass . So this was unlike the type of person you had pinned him ($_bakugou) as . 
Slowly moving back towards some underbrush , you watched him ($_bakugou) . After all , if he ($_bakugou) was dumb enough to put your guard down around you , then disappearing like a phantom seemed like an excellent way to escape him ($_bakugou) in your opinion . 
You re too fucking noisy He ($_bakugou) called out as your foot made contact with the bush . And besides what makes you think you know this damn forest better than I do ? I ll keep finding you no matter what , little thief girl . 
You frowned , eyes looking at him ($_bakugou) with a deep intensity . There were many things you didn t like to be called one of these words being little . Hearing it once more brought back flashes of emotions you had long tried to forget . Even so now wasn t the time . 
Just what the hell do you want with me then ? You told him ($_bakugou) in an exhausted tone . Hurry up and get on with it so I can leave I have a trade market to get to 
The bag on your back jingled with metals and gems as you motioned towards it , the haul hopefully being enough to keep you well fed and happy for at least a month . Maybe less , as you did enjoy to indulge yourself on high quality foods and trinkets . The mere thought making your legs get jittery at the idea of having some spending coins soon . 
The dragon rider shrugged , turning a lazy but all the while intense glance at you . His eyes trailing from your face down towards your right shoulder . The ruby hues igniting and burning away at your clothed skin underneath . His obvious interest in your skin proving to be what he wanted at this moment , nothing else seeming to catch his interest about you . 
Do I look like a mind reader to you ? You huffed out , frustrations reaching their soon to be max levels . 
No Bakugou smirked , finally moving off the tree and walking forward to you . 
He strode forward without a sense of hesitation or acknowledgement of how his confidence would make you feel in this moment . He paused in front of you , the intimidation on his face now consuming his entire being . And yet as he continued to study you , he saw that you seemed to be holding your own . A look of what seemed to be experience in this type of ordeal crossing your features . 
In fact I don t think you possess any sort of decent power , huh ? 
You could only widen your eyes for a moment , then suddenly narrowed them once more . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was close , his ($_bakugou) vermillion cape gently rubbing against your exposed lowers legs from the breeze this forest occasionally had . 
Not all of us have the time or the power to learn and utilize a powerful type of magic . You told him ($_bakugou) back , the response now catching him ($_bakugou) off guard . 
He ($_bakugou) didn t lose his ($_bakugou) gaze however , and seeing as you had nothing more to say to him ($_bakugou) , you turned your back to him ($_bakugou) . You didn t know why he ($_bakugou) decided to bring up such a topic but it made sense . He ($_bakugou) was an Arus and those who bared his ($_bakugou) mark were not exactly known to be sensible or kind hearted people . 
You had managed to get only a few steps away when he ($_bakugou) decided to speak to you once more . His ($_bakugou) tongue clicking in a way that made you now assume it was like a sound an animal made before it was about to attack . Only when he ($_bakugou) did it , he ($_bakugou) was about to assault you with that filthy mouth of his ($_bakugou) 
Then what does that make you ? He ($_bakugou) saw you freeze . Cause if I m lucky to have been born with a gift from a damn strong God then what does it say that none of them wanted you . 
Your heart erupted into a harsh beating against your rib cage . Hands shaking and the gloves becoming sweaty from the nerves that had built up . Your breathing was stern , like you had previously been running in a sprint for an extended amount of time . 
In a swift motion , you turned around to look at him . Your eyes fierce and storm like as your form came back in front of him . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes catching a gleam before the edges of a sharp blade was pressing against his ($_bakugou) throat , ready to slice him ($_bakugou) open if he ($_bakugou) wasn t careful . 
Whatever you know about me say it or I ll make your parent s childless . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked . Even if you were to slice my neck not like I d die 
You ll constantly feel your insides spilling from your throat though how does a lifetime of choking on your own blood sound ? 
His ($_bakugou) cocky smirk was erased upon your little comeback . This strange foreign girl seemed to have much more spunk then he ($_bakugou) assumed she did . But then again if a girl this fragile looking could be such an accomplished and skilled thief then maybe you weren t as lowly as he ($_bakugou) assumed . 
Now speak Your tone was desperte . ... this is your last warning before your skin becomes as red as your cape . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) groaned , now looking annoyed by all this . Would you fucking relax . I m not a damn blabbermouth ! 
What are you talking about ? Your tone change , the intensity lost among the confusion . 
I mean that I m not some bastard who s gon na run his mouth He shrugged . Get me , dumbass ? If its so important to you , just fucking answer my question next time I ask you 
You pulled the dagger away , placing back in its hidden location . You looked at him with eyes that didn t trust him , seeing as he had figured you out without any sort of clues . Something that didn t sit right in your stomach . 
How did you know ? You asked him quietly . 
When I brought you back to down with me the old hag flipped out and asked our healers to check you over . Apparently they ve never seen anyone like you before . And because of it they alerted the tribe leader I just so happened to be in the room with her when the news came . 
Well I d appreciate it if next time they didn t give me a full body check up even in the current world situation , it 's not worth it to me . 
You stepped away again , eyes sullen and low . While you had been grateful they had been kind enough to make sure your body had not received any fatal or serious injuries you didn t like how you had been outed and now interrogated for something beyond your control or choice . 
The mood between the both of your dropped , but the tension between you remained . The situations having gone through several ups and downs the last few minutes to really have the space between you both feel calm , or anything less than strained . But , once more living up to the type of mark he had been granted this barbarian warrior seemed determined on pushing your buttons and getting his answers . 
Now are you going to fucking tell me why you re markless or not ?
