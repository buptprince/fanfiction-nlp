Are you sure you have to do this , Izuku ($_izuku) ? Inko ($_inko) asks , worry painted clearly across her slowly aging features . It s just like her son to come up with these convoluted plans to save the world , but this one was possibly the most dangerous and ridiculous yet . And this time , he is actually serious , and is currently standing in the doorway , bag on his back . 
Mom , this is important to me . I feel like it s my responsibility , somehow . 
Nonsense . It s not your fault at all that this_kingdom ($_the) is worse than all the rest of them . If anyone is to blame , it ($_the) s King Toshinori , for dying and leaving no one to look after the throne ! 
He died , mom , it s not his fault , Izuku ($_izuku) pleads , trying to get his mother to see reason . Whether she likes it or not , he s leaving , and she knows that deep down . 
Look , it s not that I enjoy living like this ... 
In constant fear for your life ? 
It s not that bad ! She protests loudly . 
Yes it is ! And I m going to fix it . I promise . 
Well ... she sighs deeply , rubbing her forehead . While I don t think it s a good idea , I m not going to stop you . But run your plan past me once more , just so I can remember where you ll be . 
I m heading straight north . It s not too far from here to the border , just a couple of day s walk , Izuku ($_izuku) explains , and Inko ($_inko) sighs - in her ($_izuku) book , that is far . Stop that , mom . A-anyway , from there , I ll probably head straight for the Capital , where King Todoroki lives ... or should I head east wards and avoid the mountains ? It would be safer to head that way , but quicker to go through the mountains , even though there s apparently a dragon living there ... but dragons haven t been around in centuries , have they ? So there s not really any problem ... 
As her ($_izuku) son goes off into endless muttering , Inko ($_inko) wanders into the back garden , where there is a tiny shed that has been mostly empty for the past eighteen years she ($_izuku) s been living there . In it is her ($_izuku) sword that her ($_izuku) father gave her ($_izuku) when she ($_izuku) went to work in the army . It s been a long time since she ($_izuku) s lifted it , but she ($_izuku) laughs quietly to herself ($_izuku) as she ($_izuku) gives it a few swings . It s Izuku ($_izuku) s now , she ($_izuku) decides . He ll need it more than her ($_izuku) . It s a family heirloom , and the least she ($_izuku) can do for him considering she ($_izuku) s otherwise against him leaving on such a dangerous journey . 
He s still muttering to himself when she ($_izuku) returns , counting on his fingers and tying them into knots . She ($_izuku) can t help but chuckle at the sight - ever since he was tiny he was analytical just like this . Inko ($_inko) grabs him from his ($_inko) stupor by taking both of his ($_inko) hands and placing the sword in his ($_inko) open palms . His ($_inko) face lights up , before tears spontaneously well in his ($_inko) eyes . Inko ($_inko) envelops him ($_inko) in a hug , dabbing at her ($_inko) own tears that have been threatening to spill over all day . He ($_inko) sheaths the sword by his ($_inko) side , and before she ($_inko) knows it , Izuku ($_izuku) is out the door , waving goodbye to her ($_inko) . 
Be careful! 
I will , mom . 
You know what happened to the last person that left the town . We never heard from him ($_inko) again , she warns ominously , a shudder coursing through her body . 
I know , Izuku ($_izuku) says , staring at the ground . I love you , mom . 
Don t say it like you re never going to see me again ! 
I m going to leave now before you continue to cry , okay ? 
Stay safe , my dear Izuku ($_izuku) . 
Goodbye , Mom . 
It isn t that he s never left the village before . Oh no . Izuku_Midoriya ($_midoriya) has left the village plenty of times . He has friends and relatives in the nearby villages , and there s a tailor three towns over that his mother insists they get their clothes from . Every time they go out , they go out together . It isn t that he s never left the village before ; it s that he s never done it alone . It is only when he reaches the top of the hill and he can see the village below him that he realises how terrifying it is . But for once , he steels his nerves , and turns his back on the place he s called home forever and marches off into the horizon . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) is constantly on alert . His mother warned him about thieves and bandits , although he is more than aware of their dangers himself . While they mostly reside in the crown city , it s possible for them to move about the country at will , as with no king , there is no police force , no government , nothing to stop them . In towns such as Midoriya ($_midoriya) s , they are safe for the most part , but there is no guarantee . A singe bandit , Midoriya ($_midoriya) reckons he could take . He doesn t want to kill anyone -LRB- that s not in his plan at all -RRB- , but he thinks he could fight well enough to at least get away . Inko ($_inko) trained him as a child , and the lessons in self defence are still clear in his mind . 
It s coming across a gang that worries him the most . With a range of different fighting styles , there s no telling how he would end up . He would definitely be mugged for all his possessions -LRB- the small amount of money and food in his bag and his sword -RRB- at the best , and killed at the worst . He doesn t want to think about it , so Midoriya ($_midoriya) carries on , a scared smile plastered on his ($_midoriya) face . His ($_midoriya) knees are trembling , but he ($_midoriya) speeds up , determined to make it to the next town not too far away before nightfall . Living in the northern reaches of the_kingdom ($_the) has its ($_the) advantages - he ($_midoriya) is close to the border with the_Northern_Kingdom_,_his_ultimate_goal ($_the) his ($_midoriya) ultimate goal . 
There , the_ruler ($_midoriya) is supposedly kind and benevolent . When the occasional traveller from the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) passes through their small town , they are always able to spend a lot of money at the bakery or the butchers , and always pass on kind words about their kingdom which puts hope into the hearts of the residents of the less well off Central Kingdom . So that s where Midoriya ($_midoriya) is headed - to plead with King_Todoroki ($_todoroki) , and ask that he come up with a solution for their ongoing problem . As Midoriya ($_midoriya) rightly knows , only someone of true royal blood can take the throne , but the_last_king ($_todoroki) died without an heir and without any brothers or sisters . No one came forward as an aunt or a fourth cousin six times removed , and the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) slowly fell into disrepair while the other four kingdoms surrounding it flourished . 
Thankfully , they are living in a time of peace . There are no wars between the kingdoms , as have often plagued the country of Yuuei since it was divided in five all those centuries ago . The current four leaders of the Northern , Southern , Eastern and Western Kingdoms meet on occasion to diplomatically solve any big problems that may have occurred , and usually these are solved within a matter of days . But in all the time that this has been going on , no one has bothered to fix the elephant in the room - the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) . 
Tired from climbing up steep hills all morning , Izuku ($_izuku) takes a break , back still facing his ($_izuku) hometown . From up here , he ($_izuku) can see the border post - a small shack which you must pass through in order to legally have access to the Northern Kingdom . It s never really a problem - you don t need paperwork or identification - it s all up to whoever is on duty to decide whether you re a threat to the kingdom or not . And as Midoriya ($_midoriya) knows , he ($_midoriya) d never be considered a threat . Short , skinny and barely able to wield the sword his ($_midoriya) mother bestowed upon him ($_midoriya) , he ($_midoriya) ll get past the checks with no bother . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) flops onto his ($_midoriya) back , exhaling loudly . The sky is blue and cloudless , a blessing for him ($_midoriya) . Were it raining , his ($_midoriya) feet would have no ability to grip onto the dirt paths that made up most of the ways to travel around the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) . While it is warm , it isn t too warm , and Midoriya decides that he ($_midoriya) dressed perfectly for the weather . In his ($_midoriya) bag is a cloak , in case it rains or gets cold at night . But that s not the case now , as the sun beats down on him ($_midoriya) , pleasantly warming his ($_midoriya) body . It s only a matter of time before that changes , Midoriya ($_midoriya) notes , squinting into the distance to see grey clouds forming on the horizon . He pushes himself off the ground , and pushes onwards on his quest . 
Do you need to take a break ? Shoto ($_shoto) asks , glancing over at his ($_shoto) now partner in crime . 
Me ? 
Who else would I be talking to ? He ($_shoto) jokes , but his ($_shoto) face doesn t change and she has to raise an eyebrow . 
No , I m fine . However , if you wish to take a break , I will accompany you , she replies , still ever so respectful . 
I ll just wait until we get to the next town . I think the horses could probably do with a break more than we could . We ve been riding for a long time now . 
Momo ($_momo) nods silently , turning her attention back to the bow that rests on her knee . While trained in the sword under the tutelage of the castle , her first love , and main talent , is the bow . She hasn t had a chance to use it in a long time , and now , on this grand journey , is the first opportunity she s had to fix up her trusty bow from her childhood days . She only picked up a sword when she accepted the position as the young prince s retainer , and still considers herself new at it . On the bumpy back of the horse , she restrings the bow , and tidies up the tips of her arrows , all under the watchful eye of her liege . After half an hour or so of watching her intently , he speaks up , breaking the comfortable silence they had settled themselves in . 
I didn t know you had a bow , he says , causing her to almost jump out of her skin . 
Well , I m not really good at it or anything , I just thought it d be interesting to get back into it since it s the weapon I picked up before the sword , and ... oh , I m rambling . 
If it s your first weapon , I m sure you are good at it . It suits you , he points out , causing her to face to flush in embarrassment . 
I m probably out of practice , she mumbles , using the first excuse she could think of . 
Look , there s an apple tree over there , he says , pointing ten or so metres up the road to where the tree in question stood . He was right - red apples , not a dissimilar colour to his hair , hung off the branches , shining in the midday sun . You should try to see if you ve strung your bow correctly , at least , Momo ($_momo) . He smiles as he says her name , knowing very well that using his given name makes her uncomfortable . She s avoided calling him anything since he gave his permission to call him by his name , and all he wants to do is make her feel comfortable with him . 
Sighing , she admits defeat under the hand of her liege , and gently commanding her horse to a stop , she lines up her shot . She wasn t lying when she told him she was out of practice , but when she looses the arrow and it flies straight into the centre of an apple , knocking it off the tree , she hears an uncharacteristic snort from the young man beside her . Momo ($_momo) jumps off her horse in embarrassment , lightly jogging forward to lift the pierced apple from the ground . She picks another off the tree and makes her way back to the horses , presenting Shoto ($_shoto) with the apple that didn t have a hole through the middle of it . 
I thought you said you were out of practise ? That was a perfect shot . 
Perhaps I m better than I remember being , she muses , plucking the arrow from the apple and taking a bite out of it . It is surprisingly sour , and she has to assume that it wasn t quite ripe yet , despite its colour . 
I m glad I have you by my side if that s how you shoot . You ll be able to deal with enemies both at long range and close range . 
I m glad you put so much faith in my abilities , but I wouldn t put as much trust in my apple picking talent . Mine was rather sour , so perhaps - 
Before she could finish her sentence , he bites into the apple , the loud crunch making her wince . He chews silently for a minute , her eyes glued to him , before he commands his horse to move again , taking another bite while he moves . He seems content , but she is shocked , merely staring at his back before realising she should catch up . Her apple tossed into the bushes at the side of the road , she turns her attention back to him , confused at his behaviour . 
My apple is sweet , he says blankly , as a way of explanation . 
Oh. I guess I m just unlucky then . 
The inner city of the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) has been run down for as long as Kirishima ($_kirishima) can remember . He was born there , and although he comes from a loving family , he and his friends take to the streets more often than not , running around the city and generally causing trouble for the few residents that remained in the city . His own family had left the city a few years ago , opting to move to the Southern Kingdom , where life was quiet but easier to live . Kirishima ($_kirishima) , being the leader of one of the most famous gangs in the city , stayed there , opening his family home to his friends . 
His two closest friends are Kaminari , who has an aptitude for electric magic , and Mina , who he doesn t know much about , but she ($_mina) s not from the Central Kingdom at all , and he suspects she ($_mina) s some kind of transforming warrior . Kaminari ($_kaminari) s situation is much like his ($_kaminari) own ; however Mina ($_mina) has been surviving on the streets for years , and is the primary reason why the whole gang now lives in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s house . The whole situation is complicated , really , and he ($_kaminari) doesn t really like going into detail about it to anyone else who asks . 
Truth be told , Kirishima ($_kirishima) can t even remember when their ($_kirishima) gang formed , only that they ($_kirishima) re feared among the other looters and thieves that make the city their ($_kirishima) home . They ($_kirishima) survive off the other groups - the ones that can leave the city . There are only a few shops that are still open - a bakery , which Kirishima ($_kirishima) is pretty sure sells drugs as well on the black market , and a general store , run by an old woman that must be facing her last days on the planet -LRB- though Kirishima ($_kirishima) has thought that for the past few years -RRB- . There s a blacksmith as well , which Kirishima ($_kirishima) frequents in the hopes of getting a cool weapon . On his last attempt , the smith gave up and handed him a sword , as long as the_boy ($_kirishima) promised not to come back . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) put another gang member , Sero , in charge of getting supplies . He is quick on his feet , and also a powerful mage , complete with a magic staff that he keeps hidden under his cloak . Although he is one of the newer members of the gang , Kirishima ($_kirishima) puts his complete trust in him - after all , that s the only way to have such a loyal gang as his . Not that it s really his - he doesn t own these people , he s just friends with them . They keep each other company , and fought battles for each other . He only refers to it as his gang because it was his idea - and because he was Red Riot , infamous gang leader of the inner city . 
Bad news guys , Sero says , panicked , coming in with a bag of groceries from the general store . It s nothing to do with the food that s bad news , Kirishima ($_kirishima) could tell , as the_other_boy ($_kirishima) sets the bag down heavily on the kitchen table . The ones from Gang B are kicking up again . I saw them when I was down at Shuzenji s. 
I love that you don t even call them by their gang s name ! Mina ($_mina) squeals . It s like they re not important at all . 
They re not , Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins . But thanks for the information . Now we can plan what we re going to do . 
We re going to do something ? Jiro ($_jiro) asks , leaning back in her chair just far enough that she can see the people conversing in the kitchen . 
Yeah , course ! 
When it comes to them , we have to do something . They ve been getting in our way since they arrived here from the_Western_Kingdom ($_the) , Kaminari ($_kaminari) explains to Jiro , who , while having been in the gang for over half a year , is its current newest member . 
Hey. I m not here to kill anyone . 
Who said anything about killing ? Nah , we ll just mess with them a bit , try and drive them out back to the Western Kingdom , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , wandering over to where Jiro ($_jiro) was sat with Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) , a half crow half human who no one knows anything about but is incredibly strong on the battlefield . 
Do you not think that the fact that they came from the_Western_Kingdom ($_the) says something ? Like ... perhaps there is some reason that they can no longer be there ? Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) suggests , only to be met with a laugh from Kaminari and Mina ($_mina) . 
Nah , I ve talked to one of their members , Monoma , or something , and they re just dicks , Kaminari ($_kaminari) says in response , throwing himself ($_kaminari) onto a sofa , his ($_kaminari) legs up on the seats . 
I thought you said Kendo was pretty though , Mina ($_mina) teases , causing her ($_mina) friend to flush bright red . 
Yeah , but she ($_mina) s the enemy ! My attraction goes no further than aesthetic , he huffs , turning away from Mina , who is doubled over laughing at him . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) gets up from his ($_kirishima) seat and wanders back into the kitchen , his ($_kirishima) mind ticking over the information that Sero provided him ($_kirishima) with . He ($_kirishima) doesn t know enough about the group of people they call Gang B to formulate a proper plan . He ($_kirishima) doesn t know where they re based , and he ($_kirishima) doesn t know what sort of people are in it . They are an unknown entity - the Schr dinger s cat of gangs - while he ($_kirishima) doesn t know anything about them ; they are both a threat and not a threat . And as much as Kirishima ($_kirishima) is hoping otherwise , he ($_kirishima) knows they re going to be a threat . 
He ($_kirishima) leans against the wall , his ($_kirishima) eyes closed and arms folded across his ($_kirishima) chest , a clear do not disturb position . They ll need to act soon , lest they fall victim to Gang B getting to them before they have a chance to attack . And while defence may have been Kirishima s area of expertise , it was so much more fun to attack , and the rest of his group were experts at it . So that s what they d do . They d sort out Gang B before they did become a problem , and get control of the city again . 
Night ($_night) has already fallen by the time Midoriya ($_midoriya) dragged his ($_midoriya) feet into the next village . It ($_night) is a lot further away than he ($_midoriya) remembers , but he ($_midoriya) supposes he ($_midoriya) must have taken a wrong turn somewhere along the line and wandered in a circle . At least tonight , he ($_midoriya) can afford the luxury of staying in the town s inn . It s a small , empty place , as this far north in the country is often devoid of travellers . So it s easy for Midoriya ($_midoriya) to wander in , offer up the payment , and be granted a room immediately . Luckily for him ($_midoriya) , his ($_midoriya) room has a fire in it , and he ($_midoriya) huddles by it for warmth . 
It has been less than a day since Midoriya ($_midoriya) left his ($_midoriya) home , and currently , he ($_midoriya) feels only very slightly homesick . He ($_midoriya) s convinced this feeling won t last for a long time , and once he ($_midoriya) crosses over into the Northern Kingdom , he ($_midoriya) will miss his ($_midoriya) mother and his ($_midoriya) home more than he ($_midoriya) could ever imagine . But for now , he ($_midoriya) shakes off all thoughts of potential homesickness , and changes his ($_midoriya) clothes , leaving them by the slowly diming fire . He ($_midoriya) tucks himself ($_midoriya) under the covers , sighing deeply . He ($_midoriya) won t be able to sleep under the warm covers in a homely inn every night , that much he ($_midoriya) knows . Tomorrow , and possibly the next day , he ($_midoriya) ll have to sleep under the stars . Not that that was a problem , Midoriya ($_midoriya) always liked the outdoors . But it was impossible to deny how much superior staying indoors was to potentially spending the night on cold , hard ground , with the possibility of wild animals , or worse , thieves and bandits , attacking at any moment ... 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) shuddered just thinking about it , before closing his ($_midoriya) eyes and letting the warmth of the fire envelop him ($_midoriya) just like his ($_midoriya) mother s arms .
