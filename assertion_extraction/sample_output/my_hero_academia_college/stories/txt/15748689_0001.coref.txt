You , there red boy ! shouted the town guard . She pinned Eijirou ($_eijirou) with a wary look from beneath her cowl . What re you doing out this late ? Don t you know there s a dragon round here ? 
Ah ? Sorry! He flashed her a grin while dragging a hand back through his spiky hair , damp with the night s misty rain . Just passing through. 
That so ? The guard s scowl got craggier . If you re here for the treasure hidden up in the mountains , you ought to think twice . The dragon ll burn you right up . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) shrugged , tucking away his ($_eijirou) smile . I m not . You don t have to worry about me , promise ! he ($_eijirou) called over his ($_eijirou) shoulder , taking a wide path around the guardhouse . 
He ($_eijirou) wondered if that had been rude . The guard wasn t totally wrong . There was a dragon here , of a sort . Eijirou ($_eijirou) knew that because it was him ($_eijirou) . But the townsfolk didn t need to be afraid he ($_eijirou) had no interest in burning anyone up , couldn t breathe fire even if he ($_eijirou) tried . 
He ($_eijirou) was here for treasure , though . Of a sort . 

Eijirou ($_eijirou) often felt that he ($_eijirou) wasn t a very good dragon . 
-LRB- It made sense , really , since he ($_eijirou) was only a half dragon . -RRB- 
He ($_eijirou) could fight , yeah . He ($_eijirou) was pretty strong and tough . He ($_eijirou) was lonely , though . He ($_eijirou) wanted to be around people . Dragons preferred keeping to themselves . And he ($_eijirou) wanted to help people . Dragons didn t. 
-LRB- It made sense . He ($_eijirou) was half human , after all . -RRB- 
But helping never went the way he ($_eijirou) wanted . He ($_eijirou) scared people when he ($_eijirou) fought . He ($_eijirou) was a little too strong , a little too fast . There were claws , sometimes . He ($_eijirou) had to hold back so he ($_eijirou) wouldn t really hurt anyone . He ($_eijirou) even seemed to scare people when he ($_eijirou) smiled . It was the teeth , probably . 
There was more than that , too . Other dragons loved shiny things . Beautiful things . Mounds of gold coins , glimmering jewels , chains and rings and chalices . Eijirou ($_eijirou) was never so interested in any of that . He ($_eijirou) liked other things ones with spikes and flames . Dangerous-looking things . Manly things . 
It was hard to make a hoard out of that stuff like the other dragons did with their shinies , though , so yeah , Eijirou ($_eijirou) wasn t a very good dragon . 
Still , he ($_eijirou) felt it come over him ($_eijirou) sometimes , when he ($_eijirou) saw something he ($_eijirou) really wanted . It was a certain feeling , like catching the scent of just-roasted meat on an autumn breeze . Like taking a swallow of unexpectedly strong yet sweet ale . Like when the updraft catches under your wings , that moment right when you go from falling to flying . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) had felt it , days ago , when he ($_eijirou) d seen the boy blasting through the smoldering trees . 

It had been a dry summer . All that was left of the forest that wound around the base of the mountain was a maze of blackened stumps , like the charred bones of some once-great beast . Eijirou ($_eijirou) liked to nap out there , where it was quiet and smelled of lingering woodsmoke and pine . 
He ($_eijirou) was doing just that , in his ($_eijirou) other shape , curled up in the crook of a fallen tree , belly full and scales sun-warmed , when an explosion shook the ground . He ($_eijirou) shifted quickly he ($_eijirou) had no idea what kind of weapon had caused the blast , or how its wielder might feel about running into unexpected dragons . 
When he ($_eijirou) peered over the sooty bark , he ($_eijirou) saw that there was no weapon at all there was a boy , weaving among the ruins as if on wings of flame , a wild grin lighting his face , the rushing air and hazy sunlight turning his pale hair into a jagged halo . 
Echoes like thunder and glittering whorls of ash trailed in his wake , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) felt something pull taut in his chest . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) wanted . 

Eijirou ($_eijirou) had wanted , but he ($_eijirou) hadn t followed . 
He ($_eijirou) d watched , from his ($_eijirou) hiding spot , as the explosive boy flew farther and farther into the distance until even the reverberations disappeared beyond the foothills . He ($_eijirou) should have done something , should have what ? Eijirou ($_eijirou) knew you ($_eijirou) shouldn t just take a human for your ($_eijirou) hoard . Especially one with that kind of magic , who looked like he ($_eijirou) d put up a real fight if anyone were to try it . 
Somehow that made it even more tempting . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) couldn t shake the feeling . How would he ($_eijirou) be satisfied gathering up the usual things like thorny morningstars and flame-licked cloaks now ? As if he ($_eijirou) d swallowed a lit match , it crackled low in his ($_eijirou) chest , glowed at the edges of his ($_eijirou) thoughts until he ($_eijirou) couldn t see for the smoke . 
So he ($_eijirou) followed . 

Not one more fuckin step , said the treasure Eijirou ($_eijirou) sought , his ($_eijirou) sneer as curving and sharp as the sword he ($_eijirou) pointed at Eijirou ($_eijirou) s heart . That loot in there is mine . 
Wha ? Eijirou ($_eijirou) let his ($_eijirou) stance drop in confusion . Oh! That again , he ($_eijirou) concluded with a pout . I m not here for that , man , I m here for you . 
Fire crackled in an open palm . Hah ? Let s go , then , shitty-haired peasant ! Lord Katsuki will be your last bounty hunt ! 
Katsuki . This close , Eijirou ($_eijirou) could see that his ($_eijirou) eyes were the color of freshly spilled blood . The air outside the cavern hung heavy with smoke and spice and something that set Eijirou ($_eijirou) s wilder senses buzzing , made his ($_eijirou) shoulders prickle with scales shifting into place unbidden . 
Then the fire came 
not from where Eijirou ($_eijirou) expected it , but from the mouth of the cave . Massive and alive , a spiraling blast of flame and force . True fire . Dragon fire . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) flung himself ($_katsuki) out of its ($_katsuki) path with his ($_katsuki) own explosion and a curse snarled in Eijirou ($_eijirou) s ear as he ($_katsuki) barreled past . He ($_katsuki) landed and flipped to his ($_katsuki) feet , sword at the ready , just as Eijirou ($_eijirou) skidded to a halt with half-transformed claws gouging into the steep mountainside . Eijirou ($_eijirou) only glanced to Katsuki at his ($_katsuki) side for a moment before the ground shook again and the dragon burst from the cavern in a torrent of stone and heat . 
They both leaped forward at once . 

What the hell was that ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) growled , splayed out in the dirt beside Eijirou ($_eijirou) . His ($_katsuki) ragged breathing was loud in the relative quiet , now that the blasts had subsided and the beast had flown off to lick its wounds . 
Eh ? Eijirou ($_eijirou) sat up , looking over at Katsuki ($_katsuki) with concern . It was a dragon . Had he ($_katsuki) gotten more injured in the fight than Eijirou ($_eijirou) had realized ? Did Eijirou ($_eijirou) have enough strength left to shift and fly back down the mountain , get help in the town somehow 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) grunted a laugh . No , dumbass , not that . You . 
Oh! Eijirou ($_eijirou) showed his ($_eijirou) teeth brightly . I m just a half dragon . While Katsuki ($_katsuki) glared , looking like he ($_katsuki) couldn t decide what to shout first , Eijirou ($_eijirou) went on : So , can I have you now ? 
What the fuck 
Not for a bounty ! It s just , I saw you out there , and you were so he ($_katsuki) gestured at Katsuki , who d pulled himself ($_katsuki) to his ($_katsuki) feet and crossed his ($_katsuki) arms and I wanted to take you for my hoard and ah , I can t do that , can I ? 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) s eyes narrowed , his ($_katsuki) jaw twitching in the long pause before he ($_katsuki) spoke again . All right , shitty dragon , how bout this : me and you , one round , no holding back . You win ? You can add me to your fuckin collection . 
You re on ! Eijirou ($_eijirou) said , slamming his ($_eijirou) clawed fists together with a crunch . Wait but if you win ? 
That lazy smirk returned , a bit bloodier than before . I add you to mine .
