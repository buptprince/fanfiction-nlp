Cath na hAbhann Yuuei . The Battle of River Yuuei . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s first official translation assignment as a member of the resistance . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) tried not to think about it too much , convinced the gravity of the situation would scramble her ($_tsuyu) thoughts , which she ($_tsuyu) needed to be in a state of unmoving calm if this translation was to be useful . The papers , about two dozen of them , had been brought to her ($_tsuyu) by a scrawny messenger boy . Saints , Tsuyu understood that using informal channels was a safer method of transportation of intel , but seeing such a young boy mixed up in this chaos was sickening . She ($_tsuyu) had given him a sweet cake for his efforts , because she ($_tsuyu) had nothing else to give . 
The package she ($_tsuyu) received was heavier than she ($_tsuyu) expected , until she ($_tsuyu) opened it and found that it not only contained her ($_tsuyu) assignment but also a secret code guide that she ($_tsuyu) would have to adhere to , a list of codenames of various members of the resistance as well as her ($_tsuyu) own . Cla omh Solais . The Sword of Light . A bit dramatic for Tsuyu s tastes , but she ($_tsuyu) assured herself ($_tsuyu) it was a precautionary measure , nothing more . 
The papers were thick and starchy , a far cry from the smooth , refined pages used at the_Academy ($_the) . But this wasn t the_Academy ($_the) , it ($_the) was its ($_the) antithesis . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) was going against everything she ($_tsuyu) had ever been taught , everything that made her ($_tsuyu) who she ($_tsuyu) was today 
No . She ($_tsuyu) joined the resistance because of who she ($_tsuyu) became at the_Academy ($_the) . She ($_tsuyu) was taught to follow her ($_tsuyu) principles and defy injustice whenever she ($_tsuyu) could however she ($_tsuyu) could for as long as she ($_tsuyu) could . She ($_tsuyu) rubbed at her ($_tsuyu) black ring , the smooth surface providing a small comfort . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) dipped her ($_tsuyu) pen in her ($_tsuyu) well and set to work . 
Are camped 10,000 soldiers by riverbank . Arrived they two weeks ago . Are surrounded by mountains at the east and Yuuei River at the west . River uncrossable . 
Wait , they can t cross the river or go back through the mountains ? That would mean they re essentially trapped in the fields between . That couldn t be right . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) went back over the sentence . Are camped by riverbank . Are surrounded by mountains and Yuuei Yes , that word trasnaigh definitely meant to cross . Perhaps the answer lay in the following paragraphs . 
The next few hours were spent as Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) deciphered the profile of the upcoming battle . One of King Enji s larger troops were to raid a small village on the outskirts of the country , in an area that technically belonged to Keikei but most people considered Musutafu territory , assuming they d heard of it at all . A civilian target , and an undefended one at that . The thought of it turned Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s stomach that evil , heartless king was praying on the innocent to feed his mad lust for power . 
She burned through the remaining pages in a matter of hours , although something still seemed off to her . Why would Enji s army have no way out ? Was the commander so confident in their success that they didn t think it necessary ? That alone was a cause for concern were Enji ($_enji) s commanders so incompetent ? Should that be included as a footnote for the recipient of the translation ? No , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) wasn t enlisted as a tactician . It wasn t her place to comment on the fool king s strategies . But then again , why was one of Enji ($_enji) s larger troops sent to take over such a small village so far away from the rest of the fighting near the southern peninsula ? Was there something more important near the border ? None of it made any sense . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) looked over her ($_tsuyu) translation during the following two days to make absolutely sure that she ($_tsuyu) had understood the material correctly and had made it sound as natural as possible before sending it off again , this time to a different boy than had presented it to her ($_tsuyu) . 
The matter continued to not make sense but Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) tried to think nothing more of it . Among her ($_tsuyu) next assignments was a beautifully written piece of military intel . Ah , so we even have help that far up the chain ... It said the king s closest military leaders were developing a new method of warfare involving a new type of weapon it was supposed to be dropped from the air and create a vast dome . Inside it , all the air would be sucked out , essentially creating a huge vacuum , suffocating everyone inside . 
In later years , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) would come to decide that it was that specific type of intel that made her ($_tsuyu) nearly throw up . She ($_tsuyu) never ceased to be amazed at the lengths people would go to in order to end another human life in the most traumatising way possible . A common excuse was that these people needed to be taught a lesson . But what lesson was that ? That life ends ? That people die ? Anyone over the age of about eight or nine-years-old knew that . Was it that the aggressor had access to vast resources of power , and they should therefore be afraid of them ? That wasn t teaching someone a lesson . That was bullying . And Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) hated bullies more than anything . 
The notion that something was amiss with this battle would not leave Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s mind no matter how hard she ($_tsuyu) tried to distract herself ($_tsuyu) . She ($_tsuyu) wrote a coded message to Tokoyami asking him to meet her ($_tsuyu) on a matter of great importance relating to the resistance . It was a white lie , but Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) had done worse . The message was carried off by a different messenger boy than the first two , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) briefly wondered if the messengers were rotated or if they were replaced when one of them died . She ($_tsuyu) extinguished the thought quickly . One could only cope with so much immediate cruelty , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) exceeded her ($_tsuyu) limit long ago . 
It was a stormy night when Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) woke to a frantic thumping coming from her ($_tsuyu) front door . Who in the world could be out there , so far into the countryside , and at such a late hour ? A needy merchant ? A lost child ? 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s heart jerked . The wind and rain howled and hailed outside . Soldiers . The night patrol , to be exact . Had someone ratted her ($_tsuyu) out ? Was this the end ? 
Only one way to find out . The thumping continued while Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) shrugged on a robe and shook her ($_tsuyu) hair around her ($_tsuyu) shoulders , since soldiers were less likely to harass a sleepy young lady than a cantankerous spinster . 
She ($_tsuyu) yanked on the iron latch and pulled the wooden door open . The icy winter winds hit her ($_tsuyu) like a slap in the face and for a split second her ($_tsuyu) lungs stopped working , frozen . Her ($_tsuyu) doorstep was dark when she ($_tsuyu) peeked around the door until she ($_tsuyu) saw the small cloaked figure huddled over on the ground , shivering . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) knelt and reached out to place one hand on the figure s dark back . My goodness , are you okay ? she ($_tsuyu) asked . Their cloak was deathly cold and soaked through . When she ($_tsuyu) received no response , she ($_tsuyu) moved her ($_tsuyu) hand up towards what she ($_tsuyu) thought might be the hood . Drawing it back , she ($_tsuyu) could faintly make out dark brown hair , dripping from the rain . Please , are you alright ? 
A mumble managed to make itself known to Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) throughout a series of stuttered breaths . P p-please help help me 
Of course ! Of course , let s get you inside , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said , employing the tone she ($_tsuyu) often used to comfort a younger sibling with a grazed knee . Wrapping an arm around the figure s shoulders , she ($_tsuyu) carefully ushered them inside , although it was more like dragging . Letting the door swing shut behind them was in itself a tiny comfort , finally being sheltered from the tempest . 
The lump in Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s arms suddenly became ten times heavier . Did they ? Oh , Saints , they were probably worn out from the cold . She ($_tsuyu) gracelessly hauled the other onto her ($_tsuyu) back and brought them to her ($_tsuyu) spare room , which had grown colder than the rest of the house , the air stale from disuse . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) distantly mourned the fact that her ($_tsuyu) siblings had not come to visit her ($_tsuyu) in who knew how long , because of this damned war 
But there was no time to think of petty grievances such as this , not when an exhausted traveller needed help . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) dumped them on the bed , startled by the instant groan that bubbled up . Ah , I m sorry , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) whispered . I m quite clumsy , but here s a nice , soft bed for you . I ll prepare some hot wat 
Blood . There was no mistaking it , right there , by the person s left side , staining the white sheets . Blood , and lots of it . 
Why didn t you tell me you were injured , you flaming idiot ! Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) squawked . She ($_tsuyu) flew around the room like a whirlwind , grabbing whatever medical supplies she ($_tsuyu) could find . Mother of all Saints , there I was hauling you around like a rag doll , and you didn t even think to tell me you were bleeding ? I ve half a mind to leave you out there , so I do ! Bandages here , antiseptic there , towel , bowl , please don t die , cotton wool , please be okay . 
I m sorry , the traveller whimpered . I m sorry . And then they were gone , eyes closed , face relaxed . 
No . No , no , no , no , no , Tsuyu muttered , scrambling to the side of the bed and tearing off whatever clothing she ($_tsuyu) could to get to the traveller s wound . A thick cape , a coat 
Well. A Royal crest . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) held it in her ($_tsuyu) hands , ran her ($_tsuyu) thumb over the fine embroidery . Whoever this person is , I m working directly against them . But there was no time to think any more of it , because Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) was back to work , following the blood trails through the traveller s skirt . Yes , underneath the huge cloak was a girl . Her ($_tsuyu) smooth , plump cheeks betrayed her ($_tsuyu) youth . She ($_tsuyu) had long eyelashes , a small , doll-like face and plump lips . 
Luckily the girl s injuries weren t life-threatening . She ($_tsuyu) had more than a few scratches here and there , bruising all along her ($_tsuyu) right arm , and was her ($_tsuyu) leg broken ? No , just sprained , but it looked painfully swollen . How long had the girl been walking on it ? It was in this mindless flurry of worry smothered by rudimentary medical procedure , which was in turn smothered by more worry , that Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) operated . It wasn t until the early hours of the morning rolled around that Tsuyu could comfortably sit back in an armchair she ($_tsuyu) had dragged from another room and watch over her ($_tsuyu) patient . 
And watch she ($_tsuyu) did , in those quiet dewy hours . In fact , despite her ($_tsuyu) fatigue , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) found it difficult to tear her ($_tsuyu) gaze away from the sleeping girl . Staring at her ($_tsuyu) from the corner of the room , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) finally allowed the surge of questions to take over her ($_tsuyu) mind , almost entirely blocking out her ($_tsuyu) perception of reality . Who was this girl ? Where did she come from ? How did she have a Royal crest ? Was she a member of the House of Todoroki ? A distant relative? A soldier ? 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) hoped against all hope that she wasn t a_Royal ($_a) , or a soldier . That would cause serious problems . The girl probably wasn t a spy . Or was she ? Were the injuries faked so the girl could literally get her foot in the door ? Or was she really an unlucky civilian ? No , that still wouldn t explain the crest . Did she steal it from a_Royal ($_a) ? Was it a gift ? No , no-one would give away something so precious . A Royal crest could get you in most anywhere , and get you most everything , from arms to information . And one is as powerful as the other , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) mused to herself ($_tsuyu) . The girl could be a source of all kinds of insider knowledge . 
She ($_tsuyu) stifled her ($_tsuyu) instinct to be compassionate with great difficulty . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) would keep a close eye on the girl in the coming days . She ($_tsuyu) would play the part of the perfect hostess and nurse . She ($_tsuyu) would be attentive , pleasant , courteous , and she ($_tsuyu) would execute the role perfectly . The girl would feel comfortable enough to open up to Tsuyu , to tell her ($_tsuyu) everything , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) could use that to help her ($_tsuyu) comrades . The longer she ($_tsuyu) stayed , the more information she ($_tsuyu) could provide . 
The girl s wounds would heal and she ($_tsuyu) would be on her ($_tsuyu) way to serve king and country . She ($_tsuyu) would leave none the wiser , and she ($_tsuyu) would never see Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) again . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) fiddled with the black ring on the middle finger of her ($_tsuyu) left hand . Most importantly , the girl would never set foot in the study . 
There was nothing . Just darkness all around , stretching on into forever . Ochako ($_ochako) could probably will herself ($_ochako) awake if she ($_ochako) wanted , she ($_ochako) could feel it , but the prospect of having to move and speak and walk was at that moment , it was too much . She ($_ochako) chose to wallow in the darkness a little while longer , content to just lie there until her ($_ochako) strength returned to her ($_ochako) . 
How long have I been like this ? Somehow , the darkness felt like everything there ever was , the only thing that had ever existed but that couldn t be true when Ochako ($_ochako) still had such clear memories of walking and climbing and talking . Maybe she ($_ochako) had been in a coma for months , or even years . Maybe when I wake up , the war will be over , and I can go home . Over and over again Ochako ($_ochako) found herself at the brink of consciousness , but every time she was pulled under into the nothingness once again in an infuriating cycle . On the four hundred and twenty-sixth surfacing of her mind , she finally found the strength to crack open her eyes . 
If she hadn t known any better , or if her memory had been wiped clean , Ochako ($_ochako) would have guessed she were in her old room . The cream walls were bathed in a soft , warm light coming from an oil lamp beside her head . Yes , an oil lamp , and a wooden desk , and heavy cotton blankets on top of her . A woman with pale skin and sleek black hair , sleeping quietly in an armchair . Although her eyes were closed , Ochako ($_ochako) could easily tell she was quite beautiful . Her large hands were curled into a shawl she had wrapped around herself and up towards her chest . 
And on the other side of the room , a closed window , a desk , a wardrobe her cloak hanging there . That sigil . Her Royal Mage crest was caked with blood and dirt . 
The battle . The Yuuei River . The destruction . The screams , the torture , the fear grabbing her throat like a terrible serpent . She ran away . Her captain s words echoed painfully in her mind like a great bell the punishment for desertion is death . What would she do now ? What could she do ? She definitely couldn t return to her squadron . She couldn t return home , she d instantly be brought to court for desertion . She couldn t couldn t couldn t breathe 
Whoa there! Try not to move too much, okay? You re still injured . The sleeping woman had awoken and brought her chair nearer the bed . She placed a big , warm hand on Ochako ($_ochako) s arm and gave her a friendly smile . 
Ochako ($_ochako) blinked blearily a few times . Where am I ? Who are you ? 
The woman smiled . You don t remember ? You came knocking on my door late at night and collapsed on my doorstep . I took you inside and patched you up . I m Tsuyu . She flipped her sleek black hair over her shoulder . 
Ochako ($_ochako) s breathing began to return to normal . Thank you , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) . 
No need to thank me . I did what anyone would do . I must say , you gave me quite a fright when you arrived . You passed out in my arms , and then I noticed you were bleeding , and Well , you don t need to worry anymore . I managed to do what I could for your injuries , although it wasn t much . I don t mean to pry , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said softly , but you re a soldier , right ? I saw the emblem on your cloak . 
Ochako ($_ochako) swallowed hard . I m not a soldier . I m a mage . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) nodded strangely , as if she ($_tsuyu) had been expecting that answer the whole time . That s pretty rare . I guess I should count myself lucky that I get to meet a living , breathing mage . 
The only reason I m living and breathing at all is thanks to you . I owe you a great debt . I promise I won t cause much more trouble , and I ll likely be gone before sunset . 
Tsuyu frowned. Are you crazy ? There s no way you re leaving for the next few weeks with that injury . Unfortunately , I don t have much of the necessary materials and medicines to treat you here , since we re so far out in the countryside . I m going into town today to order some from the apothecary . In the meantime , I can lend you some of my clothes , as long as you don t mind how plain they are . I ll leave a choice out for you when I get back . She stood then , smoothing her green skirt . 
Oh , no I really don t wish to trouble you 
It s no trouble . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s tone left no room for debate . I couldn t just send you out off into the fields in your condition , that would be inhumane . But I will have to ask you to be patient with me while I get what you need . 
If there s anything I can do to help 
You can help me by focusing on getting better . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) rose to leave , but stopped by the door . One more thing . I expect you ll be here for a while you might even come to feel comfortable here . In time , I hope you will become able to walk around as you recover . But you must never enter my study , is that clear ? I promise you that you will have everything you could ever need , but under no circumstances are you to go in there . Do you understand ? 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s entire demeanour had turned to ice . Her ($_tsuyu) tone , her ($_tsuyu) distant gaze , her ($_tsuyu) strong shoulders all so unlike her ($_tsuyu) previous warmth . Ochako ($_ochako) nodded . Yes , I understand . 
Good. Sleep well . 
The days passed quietly as Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) kept writing while Ochako ($_ochako) only awoke for mealtimes . Ochako ($_ochako) was distant whenever Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) spoke with her ($_ochako) , and could therefore not provide anything useful , but Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) assumed it was fatigue from her ($_ochako) recovery . 
The calm didn t last , however . It couldn t. Tsuyu was in her ($_ochako) study one evening when she ($_ochako) heard a loud banging on her ($_ochako) front door . So many visitors knocking on my door these days , she ($_ochako) murmured to herself ($_ochako) . Maybe she ($_ochako) should turn the house into a bed and breakfast , or an inn , or 
By order of His Majesty King Enji Todoroki of Musutafu ! 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s blood ran cold . Guards . Soldiers . Kingsmen . Whatever you wanted to call them , they were here , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) wasn t ready . Saints , had they come for Ochako ($_ochako) ? For Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) ? She ($_ochako) prayed it was something else altogether . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) shuffled all of her ($_ochako) papers into the huge leatherbound tome before her ($_ochako) and shoved it into the nearest shelf . She ($_ochako) fumbled with the key when she ($_ochako) took it from her ($_ochako) skirt pocket and almost dropped it while locking the door . As she ($_ochako) descended the stairs , she ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) hair out of its bun and opened the two top buttons of her ($_ochako) dress . A deep breath . Calm . They know nothing . And even if they do , they can prove nothing . She ($_ochako) swung open the door . 
Two looming soldiers covered in gleaming armour towered over her ($_ochako) . Although they were the same height , one of them was quite obviously a few years younger than the other . The younger one had kind , green eyes and a sweet , crooked grin . He was quite attractive Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) might have even fallen in love with him , if she ($_ochako) had been attracted to men . The older one , however , was likely a veteran . His grey eyes and scarred face spoke of a soul much older than its body . It was clear who had seen combat and who hadn t. 
Making a conscious effort to keep her ($_ochako) breathing level , she ($_ochako) smiled and spoke politely . Oh my , I wasn t expecting a visit from two such honourable gentleman . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) cringed internally at the exaggerated sweetness of her ($_ochako) own tone . 
The younger soldier blushed but recovered quickly . Miss ($_miss) , we have received reports of suspicious activity in your home and formally request permission to perform a brief search . 
Bullshit . You re asking permission because you don t have a warrant , and you know as well as I do that brief can mean anything you want it to . 
I do beg your pardon , sirs , but I live alone and work from home as a translator . I assure you nothing suspicious has transpired here . She ($_ochako) clasped her ($_ochako) hands coyly in front of her ($_ochako) chest , pulling her ($_ochako) shawl around her ($_ochako) . Her ($_ochako) big eyes always could lure in a good man . 
Yes , Miss ($_miss) , well . The search is mere procedure , and we would be grateful for your co-operation . 
Come on , leave me alone . Oh , is it really necessary ? I m just so busy with my work , and I would hate to waste your valuable time when you could be off doing honourable service to king and country . 
The older guard , who was decidedly stone-faced , spoke up then , coldly , maliciously . Don ($_don) t cause us trouble , girl . We can get a warrant if we need to . His harsh tone prompted a stern look from his partner . 
Shit . No use raising suspicion . Not letting her ($_ochako) smile slip for a single second , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) bowed her ($_ochako) head . Of course , I would hate to get in the way . But might I ask you gentleman a small favour ? I have a terrible habit of being quite a ditz , so my home is usually left in an awful state . Papers everywhere , ink stains I m sure you understand . She ($_ochako) curled one hand into a small fist and brought it up just in front of her ($_ochako) mouth . I do hope you would kindly allow me to save some face by giving me just a minute to tidy up . To have such distinguished , handsome young men in my home with all that mess about why , the shame it would bring upon me would be most unbearable ! If you would be so kind , sirs 
The younger soldier blushed and pondered her ($_ochako) words for a moment , and then said , I think that would be agreeable . 
Oh , thank you , sir ($_sir) ! Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) cried , grabbing the hand at his ($_tsuyu) side and slyly pressing her ($_tsuyu) elbows inwards . The movement had the desired effect the soldier flushed even darker and smiled back bashfully . 
Of course . Young ladies must be allowed their trespasses , no ? Especially ones as lovely as yourself He received no response , since Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) quickly turned on her ($_tsuyu) heel and slammed her ($_tsuyu) heavy door shut behind her ($_tsuyu) . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) darted into Ochako ($_ochako) s room , glad to see the patient was awake . Who s at the door ? she ($_tsuyu) asked quietly . 
Just some kingsmen , Tsuyu answered absently , straightening up the room . I just need to do a bit of tidying . Can t have them thinking I m a slob , now , can I ? 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , you ($_tsuyu) can t tell them I m here . Ochako ($_ochako) s tone was sharp . 
Tsuyu didn t stop tidying . Don ($_don) t worry , I won t let them bother you ($_don) . I ll just tell them you ($_don) re sleeping and that you ($_don) need privacy . 
No , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , really . They can t know I m here . 
What? 
Banging on the door . 
Why? 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , please ! Ochako ($_ochako) was sitting up now , pulling her ($_ochako) blanket up to her ($_ochako) chest as if it could somehow protect her ($_ochako) . 
More loud knocks , but too far away to matter to Tsuyu . No-one avoided soldiers like this unless they had something to hide . Ochako ($_ochako) , what are you ($_don) hiding from me ? 
I promise I ll tell you ($_don) as long as you ($_don) make sure they don t find me . 
You ($_don) had better . No time for frustration now . Play the part , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) . Don ($_don) t move , the search won t take very long . Everything was in place . She just had to stay calm for a few minutes more . She opened the door again , smiling . 
Please , sirs , come in . I apologise for the wait . She curtseyed as they entered and quietly shut the door behind them . They surveyed the room slowly , taking in its layout and its contents . 
Unfortunately , we don t have time to do a full inspection of this property , so we d appreciate it if we could just look around the rooms . The younger guard appeared to be speaking honestly . 
You ($_don) don t have time ? Or you ($_don) don t have authorisation ? Of course . Please , as you ($_don) will it . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) smiled some more , and it felt like greasy oil on her ($_tsuyu) face . She ($_tsuyu) was certain she ($_tsuyu) hadn t left anything incriminating in any of the other rooms , just the study , which was locked . Everywhere else in the house was simple and rustic hardwood floors , basic furniture , little furnishings , some embroidered trinkets here and there . 
The older guard picked up a small hardback book that had been left on the table . A poetry book . His gaze slid over to her ($_tsuyu) . 
That is my latest translation assignment , sir ($_sir) . Just some writings from a freelance poet . 
Hmm. You ($_don) wouldn t happen to be translating into Goidelic ($_goidelic) , would you ($_don) ? 
No , he couldn t possibly know something like that . S-Sir ? 
There s an embroidery in your ($_don) kitchen in Goidelic ($_goidelic) . That s a banned language , were you ($_don) aware ? 
Does this man think me a fool ? I suppose you ($_don) would be referencing the most recent legislation , sir ($_sir) ? Please allow me to be so rude , sir ($_sir) , as to inform you ($_don) that that legislation specifically states that personal items of sentimental value in banned languages are considered inadmissible evidence of treason , as long as they were created before the aforementioned legislation was introduced . 
You ($_don) dare take that tone with me ? 
You ($_don) dare insinuate that I don t know my own trade ? 
The younger guard burst out laughing . She s got you ($_don) there , Captain ($_captain) ! Saints , I could get used to seeing you ($_don) on the ropes ! 
Lieutenant , this is suspicious material , which violates 
Captain ($_captain) , look at it . It s a book of poems . A couple of fancy , flowery words won t do anything . Miss ($_miss) , please excuse my partner s paranoia . He means well . Neither of us would dream of insulting your ($_don) intelligence . 
Of course not , sir . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said airily . Control yourself ! Please excuse my outburst . 
If you ($_don) wouldn t mind , could you ($_don) show us the rest of the property ? 
I oblige presently . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) showed the two guards the back rooms , which returned nothing suspicious . She ($_tsuyu) looked over her ($_tsuyu) shoulder a few times at the door to the guest room , watching for any signs of Ochako ($_ochako) . 
Why do you ($_don) keep looking at that room ? the older guard grumbled . 
No reason , sir , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) replied immediately . 
What s in there ? 
Nothing , sir ($_sir) , I 
Stay here . I ll inspect it . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) took a step forward . Sir ($_sir) , I beg of you ($_don) , please don t ! 
Why not? 
It s just a guest room . My siblings stay there when they visit . There s nothing but a bed and a wardrobe in there . 
I ll be the judge of that . Lieutenant , I request you ($_don) to keep an eye on the girl . 
Miss ($_miss) , the sooner we complete the inspection , the sooner we re out of your ($_don) way . 
I ve done all I can without raising suspicion . If they find Ochako ($_ochako) , that s her ($_ochako) problem . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) wiped her ($_tsuyu) palms on her ($_tsuyu) skirt and slowly followed the older guard . He ($_tsuyu) turned the handle and ducked his ($_tsuyu) head inside . 
Hmph . Empty. 
Empty? Was Ochako ($_ochako) not there ? Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) peeked her ($_tsuyu) head around the doorframe as the guard let himself ($_tsuyu) in and slowly turned about the room . The bedsheets were rustled under a sunbeam , but definitely empty . Apart from that , there was no evidence anyone had been in there . 
I apologise for the mess , sir ($_sir) . I was just changing the sheets before you ($_don) arrived . I wish you ($_don) didn t have to see my home in such a state . 
The guard pressed the back of his hand to the sheets . Still warm. 
That would be the sunlight , sir ($_sir) . 
Yes. The guard frowned . It would be . 
Are you ($_don) quite finished , Captain ($_captain) ? the younger guard sighed . Just as the young lady said , there s nothing in here . Let s keep going . 
I want to know what s in that wardrobe . 
We don t have time , Captain ($_captain) . 
But???! 
That s an order , the younger guard said with a tone of finality . The older guard fixed Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) in place with a sharp , hateful gaze before striding past her ($_tsuyu) into the hall . 
The three of them climbed the creaky stairs and the guards performed a basic inspection of the bedroom and bathroom . The search returned nothing of note . They were about to descend when the older guard spoke up . 
Why is this door locked ? He stood facing the door to the study , his hand resting on the handle . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s palms went ice cold . Please understand , sir ($_sir) . That room was my father s old study . It s been locked since since his passing two months ago , may the Saints embrace him . There s nothing but old horology books in there . 
Convenient , the older guard snarled . Why is there a light on in there ? He pointed to the bottom of the door , which allowed for a tiny band of light to peek through from inside . Shit ! How could I forget to turn off the lamps ! 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) wiped her ($_tsuyu) hands on her ($_tsuyu) apron . Sir ($_sir) , that room has a west facing window and it s evening . It s just the sunset . Son of a bitch . He better not push me . Her ($_tsuyu) last defence was a sudden bout of tears , which she ($_tsuyu) tried hard to summon in preparation for further questioning . 
But she ($_tsuyu) didn t need to . The younger guard frowned sadly for a second and looked at his companion . This property does face east Come on , there s no use inflicting unnecessary hurt on anyone . 
Lieutenant , may I remind you that she ($_tsuyu) is under suspicion of treason . 
The younger guard spoke in hushed but firm tones . She ($_tsuyu) s lost her ($_tsuyu) father . She ($_tsuyu) s living alone way out in the countryside , trying to make a living . She ($_tsuyu) s doing no harm to anyone . There s enough suffering going on right now , I won t be the cause of any more of it . He turned to Tsuyu . Thank you for your co-operation , Miss. . We apologise for the interruption , and we re sorry for your loss . Please keep yourself safe . There s a war going on out there , y know . 
I will , sir ($_sir) . Thank you both for your service . And she ($_ochako) meant it . For the younger one , at least . It had been a while since she ($_ochako) met a king s soldier with such compassion . May the Saints keep you . 
And you and yours . Let s go , Tenya . 
The taller knight huffed through his nose . Izuku , I don t think 
We re leaving . And that was that . The two guards ducked their way out of Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s low-ceiling house . Tsuyu curtseyed as they left , because it s all about the details , and let out a deep breath when the door latch clicked . But she ($_ochako) didn t dare move , not yet . Not until she ($_ochako) heard their footsteps dissolve into silence . 
That had been a close call . They had nearly found her ($_ochako) study , and her ($_ochako) work . The only reason she ($_ochako) hadn t been found out was because one soldier out of how many ? Tens of thousands ? Hundreds of thousands ? hadn t forgotten how to be human . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) would never be this lucky again . She ($_ochako) needed to either find another place to live and work , or work harder to be secretive . 
And then there was the question of Ochako , who had been panicked and frazzled at the thought of being found by her ($_ochako) fellow countrymen . She ($_ochako) strode to the guest room and swung open the door . Ochako ($_ochako) , I know you ($_ochako) re in here . 
The door to the wardrobe creaked open and Ochako ($_ochako) poked her ($_ochako) head through . Are they gone ? she ($_ochako) asked quietly . 
Yes , they re gone , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) responded , helping Ochako ($_ochako) out of her ($_ochako) curled-up position inside . And you ($_ochako) should have known that they d inspect the wardrobes first . A poor hiding place , indeed . And you ($_ochako) shouldn t be contorting yourself ($_ochako) into postures like that , it ll re-open your ($_ochako) wounds . 
I m sorry , I just panicked . I couldn t bear the thought of them finding me . 
I can see that . Care to explain yourself ? Because I ll have you ($_ochako) know I ll not be harbouring a spy 
Ochako ($_ochako) started crying silently , big fat tears rolling down her ($_ochako) rosy cheeks . They ll make me go back . I can t go back . 
Go back where? 
The battlefield . 
Oh , Saints . Another young one caught up in that king s great game . You ($_ochako) re not just a Royal Mage . You ($_ochako) were put on the front lines . 
I I ran away . There was a battle and , and , the there was an explosion , I guess ? It was It was hell on Earth . Everyone just died right in front of me . I turned around and I ran . I ran as far and as fast as I could . I didn t stop until it had gotten dark , until 
Until you ($_ochako) found some help . Until you ($_ochako) found here . 
Yes. I m so sorry . 
It s okay , Ochako ($_ochako) , you ($_ochako) didn t do anything wrong . 
Ochako ($_ochako) whirled on Tsuyu , a dangerous , beastly look in her ($_ochako) eyes . Didn t do anything wrong ? Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , I m a deserter ! I m a coward ! I ran away from a battle where my comrades gave their lives ! I deserve death . I ran away . She ($_ochako) began tugging on her ($_ochako) hair and drumming her ($_ochako) fists against her ($_ochako) skull . 
You ($_ochako) saved yourself ($_ochako) , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said , taking Ochako ($_ochako) s wrists and holding them down gently . You ($_ochako) did what any human being would do based on instinct . You ($_ochako) didn t choose to go to war , you ($_ochako) were conscripted . It s okay , you ($_ochako) didn t do anything wrong . 
Ochako ($_ochako) leaned her ($_ochako) forehead against Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s shoulder for a moment . Thank you ($_ochako) , she ($_ochako) said , over and over , in a quiet , watery voice . 
Ochako ($_ochako) , I know you ($_ochako) re upset , but we need to find a long-term solution for this . Guards never raid just once . They always come back , and when they do , I don t know if I ll be able to protect you ($_ochako) . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , let s just do what we did today . I ll hide somewhere and it ll be fine . 
No . N mhealltar an sionnach faoi dh . You ($_ochako) can t fool the fox twice . 
I should go . Ochako ($_ochako) whispered . Then you ($_ochako) wouldn t be in any danger . You ($_ochako) d have nothing to hide . 
Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) swallowed . Throwing you ($_ochako) out prematurely would do you ($_ochako) more harm than good . You ($_ochako) have to heal completely before you ($_ochako) leave , or else your ($_ochako) weakened body would just break down completely . Don t forget you ($_ochako) ve exhausted your ($_ochako) supply of magic as well as your ($_ochako) stores of energy . Staying here won t be a problem . We ll deal with the searches when they happen .
