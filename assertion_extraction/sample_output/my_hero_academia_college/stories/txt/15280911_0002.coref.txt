`` I ($_ochako) hope I ($_ochako) did n't kill him , '' Ochako ($_ochako) suddenly says , climbing off the boy 's body . She ($_ochako) brushes herself ($_ochako) off , and then looks over at her ($_ochako) friend , far too casual for this situation . "So what now?" 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) promptly turns on his ($_eijirou) heel and lays facedown on the ground . 
Ochako ($_ochako) stared at the two boys laying on the ground . Eijrouuu ($_eijrouuu) , she ($_ochako) whined , approaching the boy . He ($_eijrouuu) kept his ($_eijrouuu) face shoved into the dirt . Eijirou ($_eijirou) get up and help me . I m finally free ! She ($_ochako) yelled , throwing her ($_ochako) arms up high and wide , spinning . Turning , she ($_ochako) eyed the second boy on the ground . I also need help hiding the body if he ($_eijrouuu) s dead . 
At that comment , the blond jumped up , sparks blasting from his ($_eijrouuu) palm . I m not fucking dead , he ($_eijrouuu) roared , glaring at Ochako ($_ochako) . What the fuck ?! I thought you ($_ochako) were stuck in the fucking tower ! 
Guess not. Ochako ($_ochako) shrugged , walking over to Kirishima , who was still facedown on the ground . Eijirou ($_eijirou) , get up ! I m finally free and now we can go find me a princess - 
Hold on one fucking second . The blond boy screamed , again , and shoved Ochako ($_ochako) over . He looked at Eijirou ($_eijirou) . Is he the fucking dragon ? At her ($_ochako) nod , he smirked . You ($_ochako) said if I freed you ($_ochako) from the tower , I get the dragon . His grin was lethal . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) finally jumped up from the ground . What , he spoke , looking between the two . No one owns me , he whined , frowning . I m my own independent dragon person . 
Sucks , because now you ($_ochako) belong to me . The blond huffed proudly , facing Kirishima ($_kirishima) head on . Transform so we can fight . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s eyes widened . 
Ochako ($_ochako) smacked the blond in the back of the head . That was a joke , you ($_ochako) idiot , she ($_ochako) grinded out . I don t_own_Eijirou ($_t) anyway , I can t give him ($_t) away . Kirishima ($_kirishima) nodded frantically as she ($_ochako) finished the sentence . 
The blond boy s face grew angrier , Well I m fighting him anyway . He stalked forward , the sparks in his palms growing larger and more fierce . 
Waitwaitwait . Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped out , taking a step backwards for every one the blond took forwards . I ll battle you ($_ochako) once I take Ochako ($_ochako) to a nearby kingdom ? He commanded , even though it came out as a question . The blond stopped, looking slightly interested. I don t belong to her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) is in my care . If I take her ($_ochako) to a kingdom , she ($_ochako) can gain help with her ($_ochako) magic and we can fight without worrying of accidentally hurting her ($_ochako) . He gave a nervous smile at the end . 
With a huff , the blond boy crossed his arms . I m not fucking worried about hurting her ($_ochako) . Plus , his eyes narrowed , how do I know you ($_ochako) won t run away ? I ve been looking to fight a dragon for years and I finally found you ($_ochako) , you ($_ochako) aren t slipping away that easily . 
You ($_ochako) can travel with us ! Ochako ($_ochako) gasped out , excited . She ($_ochako) moved in between Kirishima ($_kirishima) and the blond , her ($_ochako) eyes dancing with withheld joy . You ($_ochako) can travel with us to the kingdom ! Then , when I m safe , you ($_ochako) and Eijirou ($_eijirou) can battle ! 
I don t want to travel with you ($_ochako) fucking losers , the blond boy growled out , glaring at the two people in front of him . Just fucking fight me now . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) was filled with confidence , knowing that Ochako ($_ochako) would back him ($_eijirou) up if needed . No , he ($_eijirou) spoke , watching the blond s eyes widen slightly in surprise , I won t fight you ($_ochako) now . Kirishima ($_kirishima) squared his ($_kirishima) shoulders , walking until he ($_kirishima) was next to Ochako . Travel with us or find another dragon to fight . 
It was quiet for a couple moments , before the blond let out an angry groan . Fine . He ($_kirishima) snapped , turning and heading towards the forest . I ll come with you ($_ochako) , but we go my way and I m in charge . 
Ochako ($_ochako) looked at Kirishima ($_kirishima) , shrugged , and followed the blond . Kirishima ($_kirishima) let out a soft sigh , and followed behind her ($_ochako) . They ($_kirishima) trailed behind the blond boy silently for a couple minutes , before Ochako ($_ochako) walked closer and attempted to start a conversation . I guess we should formally introduce ourselves , since we kinda just met . I m Uraraka Ochako ! The blond grunted , ignoring her ($_ochako) . Ochako ($_ochako) looked at Kirishima ($_kirishima) and rolled her ($_ochako) eyes . The dragon boy is Kirishima_Eijirou ($_eijirou) . The silence continued , until Ochako ($_ochako) snapped . That s when you ($_ochako) are supposed to tell us your ($_ochako) name , asshole . 
They stopped , and the blond rounded on Ochako ($_ochako) . Look. His voice was as sharp as a blade . I don t give a shit . I just want to fight the dragon . I don t care about you ($_ochako) or anything else . He ($_bakugou) looked at Kirishima , who gazed back at him ($_bakugou) . My name is Bakugou ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) addressed Kirishima ($_kirishima) , smirking as the red haired boy s eyes widened . I think you ($_ochako) should know the name of the person who is going to defeat you ($_ochako) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned around once more and continued to stomp forward . Ochako ($_ochako) stared after him ($_bakugou) in shock before turning to Kirishima . That_guy ($_bakugou) is probably the BIGGEST asshole I have ever met . She ($_ochako) groaned . Let s just hope the journey is short . 
The journey was not short . After around a month of traveling , the three still hadn t reached a kingdom . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a bit surprised that they all were still alive , seeing as the forest was dangerous and the company not the friendliest . The number of times Ochako and Bakugou ($_bakugou) almost fought was too high to measure , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) was at the end of his ($_bakugou) last nerve . Although , throughout the journey Kirishima ($_kirishima) had learned quite a lot about Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was , obviously , not the nicest man . In fact , if Kirishima ($_kirishima) had to describe him ($_bakugou) in one word , it would be headstrong . He ($_bakugou) always argued with their suggestions , he ($_bakugou) demanded to be in charge of everything , and he ($_bakugou) never slowed down for anyone . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was also , however , one of the strongest and manliest people Kirishima ($_kirishima) had ever met . He ($_bakugou) was able to create explosions in his ($_bakugou) palms , and his ($_bakugou) enemies quaked before him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) apparently had a reputation around the forest ; even the strongest creatures cowered upon facing him ($_bakugou) . The only creature that he ($_bakugou) had yet to defeat ? A dragon . It made sense to Kirishima ($_kirishima) why Bakugou ($_bakugou) had been looking for him ($_bakugou) . 
How far away is this kingdom ? Ochako ($_ochako) moaned , glancing down at her ($_ochako) torn dress . All of our clothing is destroyed and I m tired . 
We will reach it soon you lazy ass . Bakugou ($_bakugou) snapped at her ($_bakugou) , walking until he ($_bakugou) was standing next to Kirishima . Then we can drop your ass off and leave , Bakugou ($_bakugou) rolled his ($_bakugou) eyes . Kirishima ($_kirishima) had to admit , Bakugou ($_bakugou) and him ($_bakugou) had grown rather close during their travels . The blond had started to respect him ($_bakugou) after seeing him ($_bakugou) fight a group of trolls , defeating five of them faster than it took Bakugou ($_bakugou) to defeat one . After that , he ($_bakugou) began to allow Kirishima ($_kirishima) to grow closer to him ($_bakugou) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) worked with him ($_bakugou) when it came to hunting , and was allowed to ask Bakugou ($_bakugou) questions and tell him ($_bakugou) stories . With Bakugou ($_bakugou) s friendship came new experiences , like sleeping next to Bakugou , waking up to him ($_bakugou) , being able to stop Ochako ($_ochako) s and his ($_bakugou) fights easily , and learning Bakugou ($_bakugou) Bakugou_s_full_name_Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) . The name fit him ($_bakugou) a bit too well . 
We won t be just dropping her off and leaving her . Kirishima ($_kirishima) sent a small glare towards Bakugou ($_bakugou) . We are going to make sure she s safe and with someone who will help train her to use her magic . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) huffed . Fucking whatever. He ($_bakugou) went back to cleaning up the campsite . We should get there tomorrow if you lazy asses walk faster than a fucking snail , he ($_bakugou) growled , looking slightly amused as the other two immediately rushed to pack up . It was easy to tell that everyone was excited to reach the town and rest up . About an hour later they were off again , Bakugou ($_bakugou) leading the way as always . The three of them were making small conversation when the topic of why Ochako ($_ochako) was locked in the tower arose . Round Face , why were you in that fucking tower ? And why was Shitty Hair over here guarding you ? 
Ochako ($_ochako) sighed , smiling wistfully at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . My ($_i) parents locked me ($_i) in the tower when I ($_i) was seven , when my ($_i) magic developed . Magic is rare and considered a sign of evil in my ($_i) kingdom , so I ($_i) was banished . She looked sadly at the ground . And one day Eijirou just kinda showed up and stayed . 
I ($_i) had been walking by and I ($_i) saw her gazing out of the tower , Kirishima ($_kirishima) admitted , sending Ochako ($_ochako) a smile . So I ($_i) stopped by again later on and saw she was still there . I ($_i) was surprised the tale of a princess locked in a tower was true . He laughed , choking a bit when Ochako ($_ochako) punched him . I ($_i) decided to stop and help her , and I ($_i) made the tale even more real The Big Bad Dragon who watches over the princess locked in a tower , he teased . One day I ($_i) expected a knight in shining armor to come and slay me ($_i) , but instead we got a couple of wannabe princes and Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) snorted . I ($_i) guess that fucking makes me ($_i) the knight in shining armor . He groaned , looking at Ochako ($_ochako) . 
Too bad I m a lesbian . 
Too bad I m gay . He glared at her , rolling his eyes when she flicked him off . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) smiled and wrapped his ($_kirishima) arms around the other two s shoulders . And now we are one big , happy gay family . He cheered , ignoring their small grunts . Bakugou ($_bakugou) rolled his ($_bakugou) eyes , but allowed a small smile to grow on his ($_bakugou) face as Ochako ($_ochako) laughed and sent Kirishima ($_kirishima) a giant one . 
Ochako ($_ochako) pulled away suddenly , running forward at the sight of the kingdom in the distance . Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled his ($_kirishima) arm away , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) quickly slipped his ($_kirishima) hand into Kirishima ($_kirishima) s , looking away with a blush on his ($_kirishima) face . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s smile grew wider . I see it ($_kirishima) ! Ochako ($_ochako) laughed , turning and facing the two boys . I can see it ($_kirishima) ! Finally! Gosh does a hot bath sound perfect right now . 
Fucking finally , Bakugou ($_bakugou) groaned out , squeezing Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand . Ochako ($_ochako) noticed their locked palms , smiling , but wisely said nothing . As they finally reached her ($_ochako) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped walking . There are a couple witches in the city . He ($_bakugou) looked at Ochako ($_ochako) , I can take you to one I guess . I hate the old bitch , but she s good at what she does . 
That sounds perfect ! She beamed , looking at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Eijirou ($_eijirou) , we finally made it . Her smile grew sad . I ll miss you a lot . 
Pulling away from Bakugou ($_bakugou) , Kirishima ($_kirishima) laughed and wrapped her in a hug . It s not time to get all sad and say goodbye now . We still have a couple hours to get there . 
Ochako ($_ochako) winked at him ($_ochako) , smiling . Not if you fly us there . 
Uh , he ($_ochako) pulled back , scratching the back of his ($_ochako) neck . Most kingdoms aren t very dragon friendly 
This one is . Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked , looking at Kirishima ($_kirishima) from the corner of his ($_bakugou) eye . You can fly us into the city , we take Round Face to the witch , and then we can finally have that fucking fight . 
Looking at the two people in front of him ($_ochako) , Kirishima ($_kirishima) agreed reluctantly . Fine . I ll fly us there . He ($_ochako) sighed at Ochako s cheer . Backing away from the duo , he ($_ochako) quickly transformed and stood towering before them . 
Ochako ($_ochako) looked at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Any idea how to ride a dragon ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) glared back at her ($_bakugou) . I want to fight dragons , not ride dragons . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) huffed a bit of smoke at the two , amused . He ($_eijirou) leaned down , lowering his ($_eijirou) wing in front of the two . I think he ($_eijirou) wants us to climb onto his ($_eijirou) wing ! Ochako ($_ochako) said , moving towards it and climbing up . 
Noooo , what told you that ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) drawled sarcastically , following behind and clambering up the wing as well . Once the two were settled onto his ($_bakugou) back , Kirishima ($_kirishima) stood up to his ($_bakugou) full height . Holy shit , you giant fucking lizard , warn us next time . Bakugou ($_bakugou) punched the side of the dragon . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) flapped his ($_kirishima) wings slightly , causing the two to grip onto the dragon . He ($_kirishima) then launched into the air , heading towards the kingdom . Over the sound of the wind , he ($_kirishima) could hear the laughter of both Bakugou ($_bakugou) and Ochako ($_ochako) . He ($_kirishima) felt movement , and realized Bakugou ($_bakugou) had decided to stand up . Making an effort to keep at an even level , he ($_kirishima) flew forward smoothly while his ($_kirishima) passengers laughed and cheered . 
The journey that should have taken three hours only took thirty minutes . The citizens of the kingdom watched with awe as the giant red dragon flew close overhead , landing softly in the large town square . Settling down , he ($_kirishima) allowed Ochako and Bakugou ($_bakugou) to both climb off . Laughing , Ochako ($_ochako) patted the side of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s leg . Dude , that was awesome ! We should do that again sometime . Kirishima ($_kirishima) snorted and shifted back to his ($_kirishima) human form , gaining a couple more curious glances from the townsfolk . He ($_kirishima) blushed , embarrassed by all the attention . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) stood next to Kirishima , yelling and drawing the attention away from the red haired boy . Where the FUCK is the witch known as Recovery Girl ? A couple nervous townsfolk pointed towards the north side of the kingdom , farther away from the castle . Thanks , Bakugou ($_bakugou) grunted , grabbing Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand and pulling him ($_bakugou) in that direction , Ochako ($_ochako) following behind . 
Ten minutes later , they reached the door of a small cabin . Above the door a sign reading Recovery Girl hung , announcing that this was the correct place . Ochako ($_ochako) drew in a breath , stepping forward and turning to face the two boys . I want to do this part alone , she ($_ochako) spoke , raising her ($_ochako) hand as Kirishima ($_kirishima) tried to speak . I want her ($_ochako) opinion of me to be based off me , not you or Bakugou ($_bakugou) . She ($_ochako) smiled , moving forward and hugging Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Thank you for everything , Eijirou ($_eijirou) . You did more for me than you realize and I don t think I ll ever be able to repay you . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) squeezed her ($_ochako) back . I don t need you to repay me . Your friendship was more than enough . Thank you for everything . Ochako ($_ochako) pulled away , tears in her ($_ochako) eyes . 
Wiping the corner of her ($_ochako) eye , she ($_ochako) looked at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Thanks , I guess . You are still an asshole , don t get me wrong , she ($_ochako) laughed , but we wouldn t be here without you . So thanks for trying to kidnap my friend , she ($_ochako) teased , rolling her ($_ochako) eyes at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s snort . 
Grabbing Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand , Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked at Ochako ($_ochako) . Bye and good luck , you fucking nerd . He ($_bakugou) dragged a teary-eyed Kirishima away , who waved at Ochako ($_ochako) until they couldn t see her ($_ochako) anymore . 
The two boys walked silently , hand in hand , until they left the kingdom . Once out of the kingdom , they stood in a relatively empty field . I still want that fight . Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked at Kirishima ($_kirishima) , eyes softer than normal . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) squeezed his ($_kirishima) hand . I guess it s time for that fight then , he ($_kirishima) laughed , placing a small kiss on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s cheek . Pulling away from the blushing blond , he ($_kirishima) smiled . Let s do this . He ($_kirishima) transformed , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked , sparks flying from his ($_kirishima) palms .
