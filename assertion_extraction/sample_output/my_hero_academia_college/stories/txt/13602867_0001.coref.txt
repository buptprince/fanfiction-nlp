You are mine forever Deku ($_deku) ! You ll be my bride and stay with me forever . 
The blond child placed a crown of flowers on top of another with green hair . The blond wore tribal clothes that dawn symbols and patterns only to be worn by the Akatani tribe s heir . Besides the blond , a child crouching to his knees , wearing Mikumo Village clothes stared at the other with disappointment . The blond spoke again. 
Remember Deku ($_deku) , you are weak and too defenseless to do anything on your own . You have to marry me , so I can always protect Deku ($_deku) . 
But Kacchan ($_kacchan) I will be stro - 
Nope , you will be killed if you try anything . So , stay right beside me or I ll kill you 
Wait , are you going to protect me or kill me ? 
The blond s hands start to crackle between his palms . 
I LL PROTECT YOU AS LONG AS YOU DON T DO SOMETHING STUPID TO MAKE ME WANT TO KILL YOU ! 
The_Green ($_the) haired boy whines in fear from the loud crackling sounds as the blond screams . 
Now , do you promise to be my bride ? 
The_Green ($_the) haired boy only looked disappointed again while he ($_the) draws his ($_the) eyes to the ground . 
I can t , I m a boy and Kacchan ($_kacchan) is the great Dragon Heir . For Kacchan ($_kacchan) to marry me will make a lot of people very sad . 
THIS IS WHY DEKU ($_deku) IS SO STUPID !!! 
The Blond starts ripping the flowers out of the_Green ($_the) haired boys head . The blond looks like he ($_the) s about to burst into tears , while the_Green ($_the) haired boy does so due to his ($_the) current head trauma . 
STUPID DEKU SHOULD NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN 
The_Green ($_the) haired boy hears a familiar sound that brings warmth to his ($_the) most fragile moments . 
Izuku ($_izuku) , are you ($_izuku) alright ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) stretched his ($_izuku) arms , begging his ($_izuku) mom to pick him ($_izuku) up while snot and tears streamed down his ($_izuku) face . As Inko ($_inko) does so , another woman appears not far behind her ($_inko) . 
WHAT DID YOU ($_izuku) DO YOU ($_izuku) BRAT ?! 
DEKU ($_deku) WAS BEING STUPID AGAIN ! 
AND YOUR BEING MORE STUPID AGAIN! 
Enough , I m sure it wasn t anything Katsuki did , right Izuku ? Do you ($_izuku) want to say what happened ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) stared at Katsuki , his ($_izuku) eyes looked as if his ($_izuku) heart will explode depending on what Izuku ($_izuku) says next . 
I ($_izuku) f-fell be-because there was . . a r-rock and I ($_izuku) didn t see it . Izuku continues to cry at his ($_izuku) mother s chest . Katsuki ($_katsuki) starts to breathe again , he ($_izuku) starts holding a grin on his ($_izuku) face . 
What are you ($_izuku) smiling about you ($_izuku) awful brat ? Your ($_izuku) friend just fell . 
It was just a small fall , nothing appears to be injured 
Still , I ($_izuku) can t allow the next chief to smile at people s misery . 
When I ($_izuku) become chief , I ($_izuku) can do what I ($_izuku) want ! 
While you ($_izuku) little shit 
Enough , there is not much time left , you ($_izuku) ll be leaving tomorrow right ? It s best for you ($_izuku) both to rest . 
Right , well it was good while it lasted I ($_izuku) guess . It was good to know that this hellfire of a son actually made a friend in our Village . 
Yes , I ($_izuku) was actually just thankful that the chief you ($_izuku) married allowed you ($_izuku) to raise Katsuki ($_katsuki) at our home Village for all these years . 
Well , 6 years is far longer then any tribe stays in one place that isn t their turf . But still I ($_izuku) wish I ($_izuku) can stay longer , and I m sure Katsuki would ve liked to stay longer for Izuku ($_izuku) . 
No , I ($_izuku) am the next chief , I ($_izuku) won t stay just for one person . 
You ($_izuku) really are a little shit 
What? Instead of Dad staying here forever , he has you ($_izuku) to go with him . So , the one person should just go where the tribe goes , therefore you ($_izuku) should give Deku ($_deku) to me ($_izuku) and everything will be fine for everyone . 
Well , that is true but Izuku ($_izuku) would miss his ($_izuku) mommy and I ($_izuku) would miss him ($_izuku) too . 
If you ($_izuku) ll miss him ($_izuku) so much then you ($_izuku) can come with us , your ($_izuku) husband isn t with you ($_izuku) so you ($_izuku) don t have to stay here . 
YOU ($_izuku) RUDE LITT - 
It s ok Mitsuki , my ($_izuku) husband is a knight working hard to help protect this kingdom . So , I ($_izuku) ll do my ($_izuku) best to wait for the day he returns , therefore Izuku ($_izuku) must also wait for that day too . If Izuku ($_izuku) goes with you ($_izuku) he ll end up missing his chance to see his_dad ($_his) , you ($_izuku) wouldn t want to take that away from Izuku ($_izuku) ? 
I ($_izuku) only care for Izuku ($_izuku) to stay with me ($_izuku) , if his ($_izuku) his_Dad ($_his) loves him ($_izuku) so much he ($_izuku) can find him ($_izuku) at my ($_izuku) tribe after he ($_izuku) returns . 
He ($_izuku) s quite the debater . Inko ($_inko) looked at Mitsuki knowing that there is no point in babbling on to Katsuki . 
I m sorry Inko , the kid does n't know sympathy , but we will meet again . Masaru promised that we will come back to Mikumo Village once every year , so Katsuki ($_katsuki) , you will see Izuku ($_izuku) again . 
I ($_izuku) don t want to see him ($_izuku) once every year , I ($_izuku) want him ($_izuku) every day . 
I ($_izuku) don t know what I ($_izuku) m going to do with him ($_izuku) ? 
It s ok , for now , I ($_izuku) think Izuku ($_izuku) is a little tuckered out . So I ($_izuku) believe it s time to say our goodbyes . 
After they said their goodbyes , the mothers had taken their children back to their homes . After Izuku ($_izuku) was bathed and fed , his ($_izuku) mother laid him ($_izuku) to bed . He ($_izuku) was asleep until the first crack of light seeped through his ($_izuku) window and a faint knocked resonated in his ($_izuku) room . Izuku ($_izuku) was never a heavy sleeper , so that knock was enough to make him ($_izuku) open his ($_izuku) eyes , but it wasn t until what he ($_izuku) heard next that made him ($_izuku) jump . 
Wake up Stupid Deku ! 
Once Deku ($_deku) had jumped he ($_deku) hesitated to move again until he ($_deku) knew for sure if the voice real and not just his ($_deku) imagination . A louder knock appeared , this time with much harshness and a LAZY DEKU ! HOW DARE YOU STILL BE ASLEEP ! that followed. Knowing whose voice that belongs to and knowing too well that the voice will wake up his parents if he doesn t hurry , Izuku ($_izuku) quickly unlocked his window . Katsuki ($_katsuki) eyes looked teary again the moment the window doors opened . 
I was going to leave , and you weren t going to even say goodbye ! 
Kachan I - 
NO ! Anything_Deku ($_deku) says pisses me off ! Just close your eyes ! 
Izuku ($_izuku) had closed his ($_izuku) eyes , a little bit freighted but he ($_izuku) knew that something worse will come if he ($_izuku) didn t obey . While his ($_izuku) eyes were closed , Katsuki ($_katsuki) lifted himself ($_izuku) up and over the window . He ($_izuku) then grasped Izuku ($_izuku) s hand and slowly landed a peck on Izuku ($_izuku) s lips . Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes snapped open , a little horrified at what Katsuki ($_katsuki) had just done . 
That s something you re supposed to only do to one person , it s a kiss between husband and wife and since you ll be my wife soon we have to give each other kisses . 
But that s not something mommy does 
That s because your Dad isn t around so your Mom can t kiss anyone . My Mommy and Daddy do it , but Mommy ($_mommy) got mad at me for watching because it s supposed to be a private thing . 
Why? 
I don t know but for now on I want you to not do that to anyone else but me ! You ve already done it with me , so you can not do it to somebody else until we are old enough and I ll marry you . But just know , that we now kissed , therefore , we now need to marry one day and if you kiss somebody else I ll kill you . 
There were a thousand things running through Izuku ($_izuku) s head , but before he could process any of it , Katsuki ($_katsuki) was already jumping out the window . Izuku ($_izuku) quickly grabbed his ($_izuku) hand while still being on the other side of the window inside the house . 
Wait , that can t be right , Kacchan ($_kacchan) can t marry a boy or he ($_izuku) ll never produce the next heir ! You can t do those kisses with me . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) had a stern look on his ($_katsuki) face . It doesn t matter , when I m chief I ll make up the rules and I say you ll be with me , I don t care what anyone else thinks ! 
But Kacchan ($_kacchan) s blood is very special and if I can t give Kacchan ($_kacchan) the next heir , I ll be very sad to be with Kacchan ($_kacchan) . 
Is that the only reason you ll be sad ? 
huh. Izuku ($_izuku) was surprised at that question . 
I said is the only reason you ll be sad to be with me is that you can t be a Mommy to my babies 
Izuku didn t know how to respond to that question , what does it matter if the only reason is that ? But even so , Izuku ($_izuku) just nod in agreement to Katsuki s question . 
Up there is a cave I ve already marked it as ours since Kisses are a private thing , that cave will be where we ll be allowed to do what Husband and Wife ($_wife) do . Until I come back next year , wait for me at the cave if anything happens , it ll be a new home and I ll work to make sure it s a nice place for us to live in . If anyone dares to separate us , we ll leave everyone and only live there , so don t tell anyone , not even your_Mommy ($_mommy) where the cave is . If we have to we will elope together just , so no one can stop us from being Husband and Wife ($_wife) , and if you really want to be a Mommy , I ll find a way to make you a Mommy . 
With that , Katsuki ($_katsuki) quickly ran towards the sun , leaving Izuku ($_izuku) more worried about what may happen once he ($_katsuki) does see Katsuki ($_katsuki) again . Izuku ($_izuku) went back to bed . 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The Akatani tribe did as they promised and returned to Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) the next year . Once they had arrived all they found was empty houses , where some were knocked down and others were burnt to the ground . Katsuki ($_katsuki) had run to the cave the moment he ($_katsuki) realized that the_village ($_mikumo) was raided to ruins , hoping that Izuku ($_izuku) had run to the cave and waited for his ($_izuku) return till now . Once Katsuki ($_katsuki) made it ($_mikumo) to the open of the cave , he ($_katsuki) found traces of no human life around or inside the cave , Izuku ($_izuku) didn t wait for his ($_izuku) Husband s return , he ($_katsuki) didn t do as he ($_katsuki) was told , and Izuku ($_izuku) is a weak boy while his ($_katsuki) Mom is no better , and his ($_katsuki) Dad never around them to protect them , therefore Izuku ($_izuku) must be . . he ($_katsuki) must be . . 
To Katsuki , the world is crumbling and all he ($_katsuki) feels is anger . If Izuku ($_izuku) went with him ($_katsuki) if Izuku ($_izuku) has just listened if Izuku ($_izuku) was stronger , no . . If Katsuki ($_katsuki) was smarter he ($_katsuki) would have just married Izuku ($_izuku) fast enough , he ($_katsuki) would have demanded Izuku ($_izuku) to be with him ($_katsuki) more and if anything , he ($_katsuki) would have just taken Izuku ($_izuku) and ran away from everyone , he ($_katsuki) would have had Izuku ($_izuku) forever , but because he ($_katsuki) wasn t smart enough he ($_katsuki) has not lost him ($_katsuki) , for what might as well be forever . As far as Katsuki ($_katsuki) knows , allowing Izuku ($_izuku) alone to die was the biggest mistake of his ($_katsuki) life , allowing anyone to control what he ($_katsuki) wanted most was the biggest mistake , and from then on he ($_katsuki) will not allow anyone to stop him ($_katsuki) from getting what he ($_katsuki) wants .
