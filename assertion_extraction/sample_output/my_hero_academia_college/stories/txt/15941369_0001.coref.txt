The rain pelted the window of the train , droplets creating their own intricate little designs . Green eyes watched them roll around until they dropped below the outside glass . Izuku ($_izuku) sighed , his ($_izuku) breath catching onto the glass . He ($_izuku) looked down the train when he ($_izuku) heard the doors slide open , standing up from his ($_izuku) seat when he ($_izuku) saw a pregnant woman enter his ($_izuku) carriage . 
She smiled at him ($_izuku) and waddled over , sitting down . `` Thank you ($_izuku) , Sir . '' 
`` Happy to oblige , Miss , '' Izuku ($_izuku) hung onto the handle above when they started moving again . `` Is this your ($_izuku) first ? '' 
The woman ran her left hand over her stomach , smiling at her rounded torso . "Yes. We 're so blessed . My husband is hoping for a girl , but I think it 's going to be a boy . '' 
Izuku ($_izuku) smiled at look of excitement on the woman 's face . She looked around his ($_izuku) age , maybe a bit older . Her hair was pulled into the usual bun women wore when they were out of the house , her dress long on her arms and low on her calves . He always wondered how women went in summer with the heat in their dresses . He looked at the woman 's face , free of makeup , to see her lips moving . 
`` I 'm sorry , pardon ? '' 
She chuckled . `` Would you like to feel ? The baby is moving quite a bit . '' 
Izuku_'s ($_'s) eyes widened and before he knew what he was doing , he nodded his head . She grasped his wrist and pulled it to her stomach . He waited for a moment before - 
"Wow!" He felt a hard kick to his open palm . "So strong. I can see why you think it 's a boy . '' 
The woman nodded , smiling brightly . `` Do you have children ? '' Izuku_'s ($_'s) smile dimmed at her ($_'s) question . She ($_'s) noticed and let go of his wrist . Izuku ($_izuku) pulled it back and wrapped his ($_izuku) hand around his ($_izuku) bags strap . `` Oh , I 'm sorry . I should n't have - '' 
`` No , no , it 's alright . '' Izuku ($_izuku) looked at his ($_izuku) watch . `` My ... wife and I have n't been as lucky yet . But we keep praying , and we send our thanks to God everyday for what we have . '' 
The woman smiled in sympathy . `` Your time will come , just as mine has . I 'll keep you in my prayers . '' 
Izuku ($_izuku) nodded before he ($_izuku) looked outside , smiling a little . `` Oh , this is my stop . I pray everything goes well for you , your husband and your child . May ($_may) you be blessed in your life . '' 
`` May ($_may) you be blessed in your life . '' The woman waved goodbye as Izuku ($_izuku) walked to the door , pulling his ($_izuku) small umbrella out of his ($_izuku) bag in preparation . After a moment the train stopped and the doors opened . Izuku ($_izuku) opened his ($_izuku) umbrella and walked out . He ($_izuku) started walking towards his ($_izuku) neighbourhood . It would take him ($_izuku) fifteen minuets of walking in silence , where he ($_izuku) could be alone with his ($_izuku) thoughts . 
As he ($_izuku) walked , feet slapping the wet pavement , he ($_izuku) lifted his ($_izuku) left hand to look at his ($_izuku) modest wedding ring wrapped around his ($_izuku) finger . It was simple silver , no design . He ($_izuku) had n't wanted anything flashy , had n't felt like he ($_izuku) deserved it . He ($_izuku) only wore it when he ($_izuku) was out or had company in the house . He ($_izuku) felt sick when he ($_izuku) looked at it , wanted to throw it in the river he ($_izuku) walked by . 
But that would cause too much attention . Why was Izuku_Midoriya ($_midoriya) throwing his ($_midoriya) wedding ring in the river ? Was there trouble at home ? Was his ($_midoriya) wife okay ? Did they need a Gathering ? 
The last thing Izuku ($_izuku) wanted to deal with was a Gathering in his ($_izuku) home . 
Izuku ($_izuku) sighed again , turning down his ($_izuku) street . One , two , three , four , house number five . His ($_izuku) home was modest , a well tended to garden out the front with lush flowers , a small waist level hedge wrapping around the front footpath , a single white wooden gate keeping people out of the front lawn . A willow tree that Izuku ($_izuku) had planted when he ($_izuku) first moved in stood tall and proud , growing happily . His ($_izuku) home was brick on the outside , shudders on the windows for more privacy without attracting too much attention . 
A path lead from the gate Izuku passed through to the front door . It was done with white stones , every now and then a pink and green stone placed in . Izuku ($_izuku) smiled as he ($_izuku) remembered placing them in the summer morning with his ($_izuku) wife . 
His ($_izuku) shoulders slumped as he ($_izuku) thought of that . Wife . It was such a powerful word with only four letters that made his ($_izuku) knees turn to jelly . Izuku ($_izuku) stopped at the door where the little porch shielded him ($_izuku) from the rain . It was starting to get heavier . He ($_izuku) dropped his ($_izuku) umbrella into the stand by the door before reaching for his ($_izuku) keys in his ($_izuku) pants pocket . 
Before he ($_izuku) fished them out the door opened and Izuku ($_izuku) was pulled into a tight hug . 
`` Honey ! '' Ochako ($_ochako) squealed as her ($_ochako) arms wrapped around the mans neck . `` You ($_ochako) 're home ! I was getting worried with the rain . '' She ($_ochako) pulled back and smiled at him ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) put one of his ($_izuku) arms around her ($_ochako) waist . 
`` Sorry ($_sorry) . I did n't mean to make you worry . '' Ochako ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) head . She ($_ochako) leaned up as Izuku ($_izuku) leaned down , pressing their lips together briefly . They untangled themselves when they heard a cup drop in the kitchen . `` Is someone here ? '' 
Ochako ($_ochako) pulled back and took Izuku ($_izuku) by the hand to lead him ($_izuku) in . He closed the door behind and dropped his bag on the chair in the living room . They rounded the corner to see Tenya ($_tenya) cleaning up spilled tea . 
`` Sorry ($_sorry) , I got anxious when you were at the door for a while and I panicked but I 'm - oh Izuku . Hello." Tenya ($_tenya) waved as Ochako ($_ochako) walked over to take the sponge out of his ($_tenya) hand to mop up the spilled tea . She ($_tenya) bumped him ($_tenya) with her ($_tenya) hip . `` Sorry , sweetie . '' Tenya ($_tenya) walked over to Izuku and hugged the smaller man . Izuku ($_izuku) buried his ($_izuku) face into his ($_izuku) shoulder , happy to see his ($_izuku) old friend . 
`` It 's so good to see you Tenya . '' Izuku ($_izuku) grinned up at him ($_izuku) before dropping his ($_izuku) lips . `` I ($_izuku) 'm sorry , I ($_izuku) was n't interrupting you two , was I ($_izuku) ? '' He ($_izuku) would hate to intrude on his ($_izuku) wife and best friend . 
`` No , of course not , Izuku ($_izuku) . '' Ochako ($_ochako) emptied the sponge over the sink , turning to face the men in her ($_ochako) kitchen . `` Tenya ($_tenya) 's in this part of town for a few days so I suggested he ($_tenya) stay with us . '' 
Tenya ($_tenya) looked worried as he ($_tenya) looked back to Izuku . But he ($_tenya) was already nodding , almost jumping up and down on the spot . "Yes, yes, yes! That would be amazing ! It 'll be just like when we were in college , Tenya ($_tenya) . '' His ($_tenya) smile turned cheeky . `` Oh , but you know , I think I 'll have some late nights at the office . Tenya ($_tenya) , I can trust you to watch the house , right ? '' 
Tenya_'s ($_tenya) cheeks burst into flames at the insinuation . Ochako on the other hand laughed and grabbed Tenya_'s ($_tenya) hand . `` Thanks , Izuku ($_izuku) . You 're the best . '' She turned Tenya ($_tenya) to her and pulled his ($_tenya) face towards hers . Their kiss was more passionate , held more desire . They both smiled into it , and Izuku ($_izuku) thought it might had ruined the kiss , but knowing his ($_izuku) best friends , it would have just made it sweeter . 
He ($_izuku) walked out of the kitchen into the living room , switching on the television as he ($_izuku) sat in his ($_izuku) favourite chair . He ($_izuku) flicked through channels and had just settled on a nature documentary when it cut to breaking news . 
`` We interrupt this broadcast to bring you breaking news . Earlier this month , the_Acolytes ($_the) were called about a possible Inverted incident . '' The television cut from the man sitting behind the desk to a man in front of two wooden platforms , a microphone to his mouth in one hand and an umbrella in the other . It was dark , the only light source were lit touches held by men in black uniforms , masks over their faces . `` We now got to Fumito who is live at the scene . Fumito ($_fumito) , what 's going on ? '' 
The news reporter , Fumito ($_fumito) , nodded and started to talk . `` Thanks , Hiroji . We 're here live with the_Acolytes_who_have_taken_two_Inverted_into_custody ($_the) . So far , it seems that they ($_the) have refused to repent and are being read their ($_the) final prayers . As you 've said , earlier this month one of the_Inverted_'s ($_the) neighbours contacted the_Acolytes ($_the) with concerns of Inverted behaviour . '' 
`` No , '' Izuku ($_izuku) leaned forward on his ($_izuku) knees . `` Oh , no . '' 
`` Izuku , what is it ? What 's happe ... '' Ochako ($_ochako) came in with Tenya , their eyes caught on the screen . `` Oh no . '' 
`` Yes ... yes , I understand . '' Fumito ($_fumito) looked at something behind the camera . `` I ($_fumito) 've just been informed that the_Inverted ($_the) have refused to repent and are now on their ($_the) way to final sentencing . They ($_the) will face their ($_the) ultimate judge in God ($_god) and are being lead to Him ($_god) . '' Behind Fumito ($_fumito) two women with bags over their heads and their hands bound behind their backs were being lead up to the two wooden platforms where two nooses hung . 
The women were placed on the platforms with the bags being ripped off their heads . They looked around startled , scared , angry . The found each other and started to call , tried to run to each other , but were held back by the Acolytes , the masks hiding their faces . Hiding their identities . The women had the nooses placed around their necks . The woman on the left , with blonde hair pulled out from her bun , started to cry . The brunette started cursing , telling the_Acolytes ($_the) to get away from them ($_the) . 
A priest stood on the grass below them ($_the) , started to read to them ($_the) from his Bible , the microphone was n't able to pick it up from the distance they ($_the) were held at . A second later , the_Bible ($_the) closed with finality , he raised his hand and lowered it ($_the) , the floor dropped from the women 's feet . They dangled , twitched until they could only sway in the breeze . Izuku ($_izuku) could faintly see their faces , blue , mouths open in silent pleas to leave them alone , that they did n't do anything wrong , that they all the did was fall in love . 
The camera focused on Fumito ($_fumito) again . He smiled at the audience . `` The_Inverted ($_the) have been given to their ($_the) ultimate judge , our ($_the) Lord . Remember to contact the_Acolytes ($_the) if you suspect any kind of worrying behaviour . Thank you for watching tonight . May ($_may) you be blessed in your life . '' 
The television switched back to the nature documentary Izuku ($_izuku) had originally been watching . He felt tears on his cheeks as he stared at the television . He turned to see Ochako ($_ochako) with her ($_ochako) hands over her ($_ochako) mouth and Tenya ($_tenya) gripping the wall for support . Ochako ($_ochako) looked at Izuku ($_izuku) and rushed over to him , falling to her ($_ochako) knees to hug him . 
`` I 'm so sorry , Izuku ($_izuku) . '' She ($_ochako) sobbed into his shoulder . Izuku ($_izuku) sat there for a moment before he pried his wife 's arms off his shoulders . `` Izuku ($_izuku) ? '' 
He stood and walked over to turn off the television . It was quiet , only the sound was the rain falling on the roof . He was right . It was getting heavier . 
`` I should leave . '' They looked to Tenya . Ochako ($_ochako) got to her ($_ochako) feet and took a step towards him , only for Tenya ($_tenya) to step back . `` My being here puts you in danger , Izuku ($_izuku) . Both of you . We should n't risk it . '' 
Ochako ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) head . `` No , Tenya ($_tenya) - '' 
`` Ochako ($_ochako) look at what they ($_ochako) just showed ! '' He pointed to the television . `` The_Acolytes ($_the) have been rounding up more and more Inverted . This was the third execution this month . I ca n't put either of you in danger . '' 
"But-"
`` You leaving suddenly will put us in danger . '' Izuku ($_izuku) said . `` Leaving after the execution will draw attention in this neighbourhood . Everyone is watching everyone . People saw you come in this afternoon yes ? '' Tenya ($_tenya) nodded . "Right." 
Izuku ($_izuku) walked over to the phone by the table . He ($_izuku) picked it up and dialled a number . He ($_izuku) held up his ($_izuku) hand to Ochako ($_ochako) when she made to ask what he ($_izuku) was doing . `` Oh hello , Itsumi , yes it 's Izuku from next door . We were going to have a get together tomorrow night and I wanted to make sure that we would n't be disturbing anything you have planned ? Oh , my old friend from college is in town for a few days , he 's staying with us and we wanted to get some friends together to catch up . Oh yes , thank you . That 's so kind . May ($_may) you be blessed in your life . '' 
Izuku ($_izuku) hung up and looked at his ($_izuku) best friends . `` Nothing is going to ruin this . Not the neighbours , not the_Acolytes ($_the) , not even me . Understand?" They nodded . Izuku ($_izuku) rubbed his ($_izuku) forehead and lowered his ($_izuku) eyes . `` Ochako ($_ochako) , you 'll need to make preparations for tomorrow night . I can talk to Shouto and Denki at work tomorrow . They 'll come as soon as Tenya_'s ($_tenya) mentioned . '' 
`` Alright , but Izuku , '' Ochako ($_ochako) walked over to her ($_ochako) husband and took his ($_ochako) hand . `` Are you ($_ochako) okay ? '' 
He ($_ochako) started to nod , tried to smile , but his ($_ochako) tears seemed to leap from his ($_ochako) eyes and spill onto the floor like the rain outside had found a way in . He ($_ochako) sunk to his ($_ochako) knees as Ochako ($_ochako) and Tenya ($_tenya) cradled him ($_ochako) . It was n't fair . None of it was fair . 
It was n't fair that his ($_ochako) friends gave up a real relationship so he ($_ochako) could hide in plain sight . It was n't fair that he ($_ochako) was what made people change plans to keep themselves safe . It was n't fair that in their new society , their new order of life , he ($_ochako) could n't love who he ($_ochako) wanted to love without fearing for his ($_ochako) life . 
Izuku Midoriya hated the world for hating him ($_ochako) .
