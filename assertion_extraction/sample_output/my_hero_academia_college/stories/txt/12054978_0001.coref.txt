The summer of Izuku ($_izuku) s fifteenth year starts with him ($_izuku) leaving the only city he ($_izuku) has ever known . His ($_izuku) mom s new job is taking them far from Musutafu to a place where the population is less and the streets are quieter . A place where she can make a better name for herself and do great things . 
Izuku ($_izuku) doesn t know how he ($_izuku) feels about moving so suddenly ; though , it isn t sudden since he ($_izuku) s had since winter to mentally prepare himself ($_izuku) for this day . He ($_izuku) s been a fluctuation of emotions in the form of a boy on most days excited one moment and then nervousness the next . His ($_izuku) mom tells him ($_izuku) that everything will be fine , that he ($_izuku) ll make friends and enjoy his ($_izuku) high school life in the way young people are supposed to . Izuku ($_izuku) wants to believe her ($_izuku) , wants to hope with all his ($_izuku) heart and know without a doubt he ($_izuku) ll fit in nicely in their new home , but Izuku ($_izuku) is keenly aware that he ($_izuku) isn t exactly what everyone is looking for in a friend . 
From pre-school to junior high , there was bullying and teasing and people constantly avoiding him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) s heard the whispered words behind hands and the barely suppressed laughter from his ($_izuku) other classmates . Izuku ($_izuku) grew up knowing he ($_izuku) was a little too odd for the taste of his ($_izuku) peers his ($_izuku) mumbling too constant and loud and his ($_izuku) attention on all the wrong things . He ($_izuku) was hopeful and yearning in a way that even the teachers believed was too much for a boy like him ($_izuku) , so plain and average , and when Izuku ($_izuku) was rejected from the high school of his ($_izuku) dreams one of the best in the entire country that only proved them right . His ($_izuku) dreams are too big for someone like him ($_izuku) . 
So really , Izuku ($_izuku) isn t sure how upset he ($_izuku) is about moving . It s a nice idea , starting fresh where no one knows his ($_izuku) name or history where he ($_izuku) doesn t have the baggage of constant bullying hanging over his ($_izuku) shoulders . It had hurt when he ($_izuku) left and no one bothered to tell him ($_izuku) goodbye or wish him ($_izuku) good luck with his ($_izuku) new life . The only ones that bothered to send him ($_izuku) off personally were the old couple that lived next to him ($_izuku) and his ($_izuku) mom that helped babysit him ($_izuku) when he ($_izuku) was younger . They had given him ($_izuku) hugs and hard candies and a card small enough to stuff in his ($_izuku) pocket . 
But Musutafu , despite how cruel it was to him ($_izuku) at times , was home in the simplest of sense and the easiest of ways . Izuku ($_izuku) knows where all the good places to eat are and which places have which sales on which days . He ($_izuku) was familiar with walking down those streets every day , able to find his ($_izuku) way home no matter where his ($_izuku) feet ended up taking him ($_izuku) . Now he ($_izuku) has to relearn all that , and though the idea of exploring a new city ignites a bit of excitement in his ($_izuku) bones , it s a bit daunting to think about . What if he ($_izuku) gets lost and can t find his ($_izuku) way home and causes trouble for everyone ? What if he ($_izuku) makes his ($_izuku) mom worry because he ($_izuku) s unable to properly get his ($_izuku) feet off the ground in the end ? She ll probably urge them to move back because Izuku ($_izuku) knows she d do anything for him ($_izuku) , and he ($_izuku) doesn t want to be the cause of her unable to follow her dream . 
She doesn t deserve that . She doesn t deserve such an incapable son . 
How long before we get there , Izuku ($_izuku) asks , tired from the negative train of thought for one day . They ve been driving for hours and his body s getting sore from staying in one place for too long ; he does n't want his mind to tire out as well . 
It shouldn t be too much longer , his mom answers , excitement hitching her tone . She leans forward to read an oncoming sign . Our exit should be right around here , and then it s just a few more miles after that . We won t beat the movers , but we should get there a bit after lunch . Or I could stop real quick if you re hungry . 
It s a nice offer and Izuku ($_izuku) is starting to feel the dull gnawing of hunger now that he ($_izuku) s focused on something other than his ($_izuku) tumult of thoughts , but it doesn t seem necessary at this point . I m fine . Maybe we can find a place to eat in town once everything seems okay . 
That s a wonderful idea ! '' his ($_izuku) mom chirps , so , so excited about this new town . `` It ll help us learn the town better and shoot ! 
The exclamation makes Izuku ($_izuku) blink , shocked by his ($_izuku) mom s outburst and curious too . He ($_izuku) sees her frantically looking between the road and off to the side like she s trying to make up her mind about where to go , but it isn t quite working . Ruminating on decisions isn t an easy thing while driving a car , Izuku ($_izuku) is sure of . 
Izuku ($_izuku) unbuckles his ($_izuku) seatbelt and leans forward , sitting on his ($_izuku) knees , and hands gripping the back of his ($_izuku) mom s seat as he ($_izuku) tries to see if he ($_izuku) can help . What s wrong ? 
I think I missed our turn a couple exits back . 
Izuku ($_izuku) bites his ($_izuku) lip and keeps an eye out for anything that might indicate a safe point to turn around in . He ($_izuku) knows his ($_izuku) mom well enough to know she won t be comfortable turning around in the middle of the road to retrace their route . 
What about there? he ($_izuku) points to what seems to be an older exit coming up . It s hard to see with all the foliage covering the sign , but if it doesn t work out , they could always find a rest stop on the road and ask for proper directions . 
His ($_izuku) mom nods , determined shine in her eyes and takes the turn . It s fine at first until the foliage gets thicker and the road gets bumpier and the incline steeper . For a brief second , Izuku ($_izuku) feels like they might crash and the idea of it chills his bones because it would be his fault entirely . 
Sit down , Izuku ($_izuku) ! his mom says in a voice sharp enough that he complies before he even realizes it , his hand gripping the handle above the door to keep himself steady . 
Though he can see a fine sheen of sweat on his mom s forehead through the rearview mirror , her expression is still determined , not at all anxiety ridden like the way Izuku feels . The road feels never ending and terrible , and Izuku ($_izuku) watches as branches snap at the windows like breaking fingers and their surroundings become nothing but a green blur around them . A sudden stop marks the end of it , his mom applying the brakes so suddenly that Izuku ($_izuku) feels like he would have shot through the window if not for his tight grip . 
His mom lets out a giant sigh , as does Izuku ($_izuku) , both relieved that it s over . In front of the car is a stone statue of what , he isn t quite sure but it s weatherworn and eerie in a way he can t quite place . Even odder than the statue stands the entrance to some place . It s traditional in structure and the paint job might have originally been red and not the faded and cracked color that it is today . 
I wonder what it is , Izuku ($_izuku) mutters aloud and is out the car before his ($_izuku) mom can even think of an answer . 
Eyes roaming the building , he ($_izuku) thinks about what it might be as he ($_izuku) walks closer leaves and branches crunching underfoot . When he ($_izuku) knocks on the side , it sounds oddly hollow , like it s made of plaster or a similar material . An old amusement park perhaps or maybe the entrance to a housing subdivision . Or maybe the backway to some place that isn t used anymore if the overgrown path is anything to go by . 
Izuku ($_izuku) , his ($_izuku) mom s voice is soft with worry , she s standing right by his ($_izuku) elbow . let s go back in the car and see if we can get out of here . 
Selfishly , Izuku ($_izuku) doesn t want to leave , not yet . The more time he ($_izuku) can waste , the more time he ($_izuku) can spend away from his ($_izuku) new and inevitable future . Plus , this building is odd and he ($_izuku) s curious about what lies on the other side of it . 
Can we walk through here first ? he ($_izuku) even adds a bit of a pleading look to help his ($_izuku) case . There might be people on the other side that can help us . Give us direction and maybe even look at the car to make sure it can still drive . 
Seconds stretch as his ($_izuku) mom weighs the options in her head , her lip biting a habit that Izuku ($_izuku) picked up . She glances between the ominously dark entryway and back to Izuku ($_izuku) a few times before sighing and nodding . 
But we have to be quick about it , okay . The movers won t be happy if we re too late . 
Izuku ($_izuku) nods his ($_izuku) promise and takes a deep breath before stepping into the entryway , steps careful and already mildly overwhelmed by how dark it is despite how bright it is outside . His ($_izuku) mom is quick to keep pace with him ($_izuku) , something he ($_izuku) doesn t mind because the way gets steadily darker and it feels like there will never be an end . He ($_izuku) doesn t know how long they walk , only the soft echo of their feet against the stone floor keeps their time . He ($_izuku) spares a brief look back , seeing that the way they came in is only a pinprick of light . 
For a second , he ($_izuku) s worried that this might be a terrible idea , that they should turn around because this is obviously turning into a fruitless effort . However , that s when they see it , a flooding of light indicating the end of the tunnel . They have finally reached a destination , and Izuku ($_izuku) , suddenly so full of excitement and relief , rushes ahead in a burst of energy he ($_izuku) can t explain . His ($_izuku) mom s pleas for him ($_izuku) to slow down and come back and not run off so suddenly falling deaf to his ($_izuku) ears . 
Izuku ($_izuku) feels wonder and awe when he ($_izuku) emerges to the other side . All around him ($_izuku) is a place that s beautiful and serene , almost like he ($_izuku) s in another world . There is grass waving in the sweet scented breeze and slightly sloping hills . Overhead floats the whitest and puffiest clouds Izuku ($_izuku) has ever seen hanging in a blue sky so bright and wonderful , he ($_izuku) can t even begin to describe the color . There are old buildings , collapsed and sunken deep into the earth that only roofs show , but it seems to fit with the landscape around him ($_izuku) in an odd sort of way . On this side , the entryway is more weatherworn but the color is bright , a distinctive red with an old clock that sits proudly on the face of it despite being frozen in time . 
He ($_izuku) wants to explore further beyond this area , but he ($_izuku) remembers that he ($_izuku) should wait for his ($_izuku) mom and see what she thinks about it . She pops up a moment later , huffing her breaths and worry leaking from her frame when she spots her son . 
Please don t run off like that again , dear , there s no scolding in her voice , just worry and Izuku ($_izuku) feels guilt curling in his ($_izuku) stomach . your mother isn t as young as she used to be , you know ? 
Sorry , mom . Izuku ($_izuku) apologizes and offers her his ($_izuku) elbow to grab onto . This place though , it s nice , isn t it ? I m still wondering what it might be , but I got nothing . 
It really is lovely . Maybe it s a sanctuary of some sort , for wildlife ? You know they like to leave those untouched as possible . Do you want to explore a bit more ? I m sure there must be something close . 
Izuku ($_izuku) nods frantically , eyes shining in a way that s a remnant from when he was younger and everything new excited him . His mom laughs and ushers him forward gently , letting him lead with careful steps and searching eyes . 
They walk a while , green grass brushing against their ankles and the sun warming them overhead . The weather is nice enough that neither of them complain , just fill the air with the occasional chatter about idle things . Izuku ($_izuku) doing most the talking because that s how it always goes . 
They pass a flower field at one point and what looks like a half-formed river the next . Izuku ($_izuku) is quick to help his ($_izuku) mom across it since there isn t a bridge that he ($_izuku) can see and the large rocks will be dangerous if she ($_izuku) slips . 
They land on steps cracked and moss covered from age and above them seems to be the beginnings of a town . 
Izuku ($_izuku) , someone s cooking something , his mom states , her ($_izuku) finger pointing up ahead . 
Izuku ($_izuku) smells it too savory and delicious scents that make his ($_izuku) mouth water and stomach growl at the thought of what all the food might be . After all that walking , he ($_izuku) isn t opposed to stopping to eat something . 
It s a unanimous decision to walk into the town and see where the food is . The buildings here too are aged in a way that seems quaint with their chipping paint and crooked signs though odd that there isn t a single a person that he ($_izuku) can see around . But the_Midoriyas ($_the) trudge on regardless . Izuku ($_izuku) brings up the idea that maybe they ($_the) re preparing for a festival of some sort and his ($_izuku) mom agrees since that s only reason they ($_the) can think such a large place would look like a ghost town . 
There , Izuku ($_izuku) points out when they ($_the) enter what seems to be a restaurant district . One of the establishments has a large array of food already cooked and prepared and layed out on the counter . There s even food still boiling in the pots , but Izuku ($_izuku) doesn t see a single person that might work there . 
His ($_izuku) mind starts churning out possibilities , wondering why someone would leave all this food out and restaurant empty even though it s the afternoon . He ($_izuku) should do more investigating before getting comfortable , see if anyone shows up that can answer his questions . 
Hey mom , I m gon na look around a bit more . You sit down and eat something , okay . 
His ($_izuku) mom , already seated , looks at him ($_izuku) with worry , like she isn t quite comfortable with Izuku ($_izuku) wandering around by himself ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) doesn t blame her though . This place is odd , but he ($_izuku) should be fine . He ($_izuku) doesn t plan to wander too long or go too far away . 
Are you sure , sweetie ? You haven t eaten since this morning and then you did all that walking . 
So did you , but I ll be okay for a few more minutes . You know how I get when I m curious . 
Well if you re sure , she says uncertainly , but grabs a plate and begins putting food on it regardless . ask around for the owner of this stall too if you can . I want to be able to pay them back . I ll stay here so you can find me if you need me . Stay safe honey . 
She sends him a smile over her shoulder , one that Izuku ($_izuku) returns ten-fold before he heads off on his search . 
Izuku ($_izuku) s curiosity pulls him towards another set of stone steps , spotting a large and ornate bathhouse when he reaches the top . It s in business if the black smoke coming from the pipe is any indication of that . Maybe this place more like a vacation town or tourist trap a place more likely to see a rise in activity when night falls rather than midafternoon . 
Peering over the side of the bridge that separates the bathhouse from the rest of the town , Izuku ($_izuku) spots a train emerging from somewhere and going someplace else . This place is getting odder and odder still he decides as he rushes to the other side of the bridge to see the train pass under it . He doesn t have a clue where it s going because he has no clue where he is at this point . This is becoming a problem . 
Pushing back from the red painted railing , Izuku ($_izuku) turns but falters when he ($_izuku) spots a person standing just a few feet away from him ($_izuku) . It s a boy about his ($_izuku) age , clothes oddly traditional and hair white on one side and scarlet on the other and a scar on his ($_izuku) face just barely hidden by the shadow of his ($_izuku) hair . They seem both shocked to see each other , a silence that hangs heavy and tense before Izuku ($_izuku) gives a quivering smile and weak wave . 
H-hello , he ($_izuku) tries to be polite , but it doesn t quite seem to work . 
How did you get here ? the_boy ($_izuku) asks instead , his ($_izuku) tone smooth like velvet , but the look in his ($_izuku) eyes is cold like shards of ice . 
I we that is me and my mom Izuku s tongue stumbles and trips over words , all social graces failing him ($_izuku) at once . 
It doesn t matter , the_strange_boy ($_izuku) says , stepping closer to Izuku , his ($_izuku) feet making sounds on the wooden bridge this time . You need to leave . 
Izuku ($_izuku) falters , confusion growing as he ($_izuku) takes a wary step back , shoulders hunching protectively instinctually . He ($_izuku) opens his ($_izuku) mouth to question why and just who this_person ($_izuku) is , but he ($_izuku) gets cut off by a harsh look that freezes him ($_izuku) in place . 
Leave , the_stranger ($_izuku) says again , taking strides closer until he ($_izuku) has Izuku ($_izuku) s arm in a tight grip before gets dark , you need to cross the river and leave . 
Like a spell has been broken , time becomes disjointed . The sun sets in a matter of seconds , cloaking the two boys in the dark and lanterns buzz and flicker to life around them . Izuku ($_izuku) feels panic jackrabbiting his ($_izuku) heart against his ($_izuku) ribcage at how rapidly the situation has gotten worse , how quickly everything is changing . 
The_boy ($_izuku) looks behind them at the looming bathhouse , hissing out a curse before turning his ($_izuku) attention back on Izuku ($_izuku) . 
Cross the river before it gets completely dark . You have time while they re still lighting the lanterns . He ($_izuku) instructs cryptically before shoving Izuku ($_izuku) with enough force to propel him ($_izuku) forward . I ll distract them . Go! 
Enough urgency has risen in the other s tone that Izuku wastes no time running down the stairs even though he ($_izuku) nearly falls flat on his ($_izuku) face in the process . He ($_izuku) does spare the briefest of glances over his ($_izuku) shoulder to see the boy , his ($_izuku) back towards him ($_izuku) in a stance that seems intentional seems protective . 
I can trust him ($_izuku) , Izuku ($_izuku) thinks fiercely as he ($_izuku) runs frantically down the streets , ignoring the aches in his ($_izuku) sides and the panic climbing up his ($_izuku) throat . He ($_izuku) needs to get his ($_izuku) mom quickly and get them out of here while the lanterns are still slowly lighting up around him ($_izuku) . The river isn t far , so if they run they can make it and go home . 
He ($_izuku) swears he ($_izuku) sees shadows rising from the ground and taking shapes around him ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) runs , but he ($_izuku) ignores that , too focused on finding his ($_izuku) mom so they can leave . When he ($_izuku) stumbles on the place he ($_izuku) left her , he ($_izuku) is shaken to the core by what he ($_izuku) sees . Around the stool and the counter is a mess of food , more food than his ($_izuku) mom could ever eat in one sitting . In the stool , large and nearly bursting out of the outfit he ($_izuku) remembers his ($_izuku) mom wearing , is a pig . 
It feels like a sick joke and Izuku tastes bile crawling up the back of his ($_izuku) throat from the panic and horror that has already set in . This can t be his ($_izuku) mom , but that s exactly where he ($_izuku) left her when he ($_izuku) so stupidly went off on his ($_izuku) own . Maybe if he ($_izuku) can lead her to the river , it can be fixed , whatever this . 
Mom , he ($_izuku) says frantically , urgently , hands touching just the clothes still afraid and struck by disbelief . Mom ! Mom ! We need to go , come on , mom ! Please! 
The pig just turns to give him ($_izuku) an uninterested look eyes the same green as his ($_izuku) mom s before it grows interested in the few remaining remnants of food on the counter . Izuku unsure of what to do takes steps back until he ($_izuku) hits a wooden pillar as a plate is broken and more messes are made . From the steam of still cooking meals , a swatter attached to a hand hits the pig -LRB- hismomnothismomit sherit snother -RRB- repeatedly in the face , the sound so sharp that Izuku ($_izuku) swears he ($_izuku) feels it too from where he ($_izuku) stands . 
When the pig falls from the stool into a squealing heap on the ground , Izuku ($_izuku) can t take it anymore . His ($_izuku) once frozen legs urge him ($_izuku) to move , to run to the river himself ($_izuku) because none of this real , it ($_izuku) ca n't be . He ($_izuku) chokes out a sob , an I m sorry falling on deaf ears as he ($_izuku) runs , tears rolling freely down his ($_izuku) freckled cheeks . All around him ($_izuku) shadows are becoming people and lanterns are being lit . How quickly this place has turned into something terrible and unfathomable . 
He ($_izuku) just runs and runs and runs until he ($_izuku) hits the river , only stopping when he ($_izuku) realizes the water suddenly too deep to cross when it reaches his ($_izuku) waist just a few steps in . He ($_izuku) stares out in disbelief , water stretches across the expanse that was only grass just less than an hour ago , the place where he ($_izuku) entered distant and glowing . 
This can t be real , he ($_izuku) repeats in his ($_izuku) mind over and over like saying it will make it true . All of this can t be close to real . He ($_izuku) must be in the car and dreaming still , but his ($_izuku) chest aches as he ($_izuku) struggles to breathe and the tears are hot as they fall down his ($_izuku) face . He ($_izuku) curls up on the stairs and wishes and waits for all of this to be over . 
As he ($_izuku) wishes for himself ($_izuku) to just disappear .
