Generally , Izuku ($_izuku) didn t mind the standard classes . His ($_bakugou) teacher let Bakugou ($_bakugou) get away with too much , but he ($_bakugou) also let him ($_bakugou) defend himself ($_bakugou) so long as he ($_bakugou) was quiet about it - a good illusion did a lot of work . But with the talk of future schools and goals for the future Izuku really wished sometimes he ($_bakugou) could mute things publically with his ($_bakugou) magic , because Bakugou ($_bakugou) s declaration was giving him ($_bakugou) a headache . Still , he ($_bakugou) couldn t help but chuckle when the class collectively got mad at him ($_bakugou) . But then the teacher looked over . 
You re also going for U.A. , aren t you , Midoriya ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) froze before glancing back at Izuku ($_izuku) . The class looked on curiously and Izuku ($_izuku) hoped his ($_izuku) unamused stare at the teacher conveyed his ($_izuku) frustration because honestly , he ($_izuku) had no right to talk about his ($_izuku) students goals like gossip . 
Deku ($_deku) . 
Izuku ($_izuku) could only groan internally , before turning his ($_izuku) attention back to his ($_izuku) childhood friend . For lack of a better word . He ($_izuku) really just wanted to head home , so he ($_izuku) could refine his ($_izuku) notes a bit more . Yes , Kacchan ($_kacchan) ? 
-LRB- Really , if Bakugou ($_bakugou) was going to insist on calling him ($_izuku) by his ($_izuku) childhood insult , Izuku ($_izuku) was going to insist on calling him ($_izuku) by his ($_izuku) childhood nickname . Had Bakugou ($_bakugou) been the sort to be insulted by things like that , it probably would have gotten him ($_izuku) to back off with it a bit , but noooo , Bakugou ($_bakugou) had to be all confidence . -RRB- 
Do you really think you can get into U.A. ($_u.a.) with that kind of quirk ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked , his ($_bakugou) perpetual scowl growing worse by a margin . 
Here we go again , Izuku ($_izuku) thought to himself ($_izuku) . 
I don t see why not . It may not be combat oriented in it s most simple uses , but this sort of thing can do plenty if you apply it right . And you re always calling me a nerd , right ? He smiled easily , though he gripped his pencil tightly . So I think that would make me smart enough to figure that out . Not everything has to be brute force to be strong , Kacchan ($_kacchan) . 
Part of Izuku ($_izuku) wished Bakugou ($_bakugou) had waited till after classes , if only so Izuku ($_izuku) could lure him ($_bakugou) away with an illusion and then make his ($_bakugou) escape . He ($_bakugou) d never responded well to Izuku s desperate attempts to maintain their friendship , and eventually he ($_bakugou) d stopped . It worked out for them that way , in the end . Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t lash out at him ($_bakugou) as much - especially once he ($_bakugou) believed Izuku ($_izuku) to be a late bloomer - and Izuku ($_izuku) didn t have to worry about treading on eggshells . Unless things like this happened , anyways . 
The moment someone figures out it s just an illusion , you ll be screwed , you know that , right ? That shit ain t cut for a hero ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) s tone was sharp as ever , and he ($_bakugou) almost got out of his ($_bakugou) desk to storm over - intimidation tactics that the boy never quite dropped . 
If they find out . Izuku ($_izuku) hums , instead . I feel like you re trying to deter me from applying . It s not going to work , you know . 
Everyone knows the best heroes start out spectacular early , Deku ($_deku) - and that means being the only one from their shitty middle school to get into U.A. ($_u.a.) ! Ah , there as his usual , bombastic self . But after a moment , Bakugou ($_bakugou) huffed , glancing away with a glare -LRB- which was different than the scowl , Izuku ($_izuku) had learned that long ago -RRB- . If you re gon na try , go right ahead . You won t get in with a weak quirk like that . And hey , if you re lucky with that cheap quirk of yours , maybe someday I might even let you be my sidekick . But that s as far as you ll ever get with your parlor tricks , do you hear me !? 
And with that , Bakugou ($_bakugou) roughly turned back around , jolting his ($_bakugou) desk and chair while the class whispered among themselves , until their teacher cleared his ($_bakugou) throat and resumed the classwork . Once the rest of the class took their attention off him ($_bakugou) , returning to filling out the handouts for different high schools and then whatever else the teacher had planned , Izuku ($_izuku) let out a soft , shaky breath , staring at his ($_bakugou) white knuckles and where his ($_bakugou) nails had digged into his ($_bakugou) skin . 
Maybe someday he ($_bakugou) d feel as confident as he ($_bakugou) acted when his ($_bakugou) his_childhood_friend ($_bakugou) was involved . To his ($_bakugou) great relief , the rest of the day passed without event however . 
His ($_bakugou) sidekick ? Really? More like his ($_bakugou) babysitter . Someone said from behind him ($_bakugou) , as he ($_bakugou) was packing up his ($_bakugou) bag . Her voice wasn t nearly as harsh as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s - oh no , it was gentle in comparison - but there was a certain edge to it . 
Turning around , Izuku ($_izuku) smiled and shook his ($_izuku) head . On the windowsill there sat a Kazuha , red fur groomed perfectly and a kerchief sealed with a pearl around her neck , giggling to herself . 
Someone s going to see me talking to the window someday , and everyone s going to think I m crazy someday , Kazuha . Is that what you want ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked , laughter sneaking into his ($_izuku) words . He ($_izuku) didn t really mind , however . It felt better than the anxiety that Bakugou ($_bakugou) brought wherever he ($_izuku) went . Standing up , he ($_izuku) looked directly at the white blur hanging around the front chalkboard before bowing , earning an affectionate jingle of a laugh . Whatever that had once been , it was fond of the school . 
They won t , just like they didn t see that . I always make sure of it , after all . Just like they never see me . Now then , I hear the morning commute was exciting . Tell me all about it ? Kazuha ($_kazuha) asked , jumping down to the floor and padding beside him ($_kazuha) , unnoticed by anyone who remained in the class or the hallways as they left . 
`` Sure , sure - were you here all day ? I thought you were napping when I left . '' 
`` I was , but then I got bored . And besides , I like listening in on schools . It 's ... informative . '' 
While Kazuha ($_kazuha) hid herself from the rest of the world around her , Izuku ($_izuku) merely cast a combined illusion and silencing spell around himself ($_woods) , so no one could see him ($_woods) looking down at his ($_woods) otherwise invisible companion and talking - if anyone looked , they might see him ($_woods) deep in thought , and if they got close they may hear something akin to his ($_woods) muttering storms , but otherwise it would just be a normal kid heading home by himself ($_woods) that they saw . 
Child s play , honestly . 
It wasn t too much , honestly - some purse snatcher panicked , and he ($_woods) had a gigantification quirk . But it was enough to qualify as a villain attack . Kamui_Woods ($_woods) - that newcomer I told you about , remember him ($_woods) ? - was so cool though! I wish I could have heard what he ($_woods) was saying Kamui ($_kamui) cornered the guy on the railway overpass , and right when he ($_woods) was about to use his ($_woods) signature move , another newcomer who also had a gigantification quirk swooped in out of nowhere and stole the show ! It looks like she can only use either her normal size or her giant size - she d need a lot of clear streets to get around with her size though , I wonder if she goes about normally and then shifts when she s needed ? 
She sounds like quite the character . But poor Kamui ($_kamui) s pride ! The earth spirits are fond of him ($_woods) , you know . They ll be doing him ($_woods) favors for a while , I m sure . Kazuha ($_kazuha) laughed . 
They won t target Mount Lady , will they ? 
Hm . no , not really . A few misplaced items , some harmless bad luck perhaps , but the spirits don t have the same strength they used to . Not to those who can t see them , anyways . It s for the best that way though . 
Izuku ($_izuku) nodded - he ($_izuku) remembered when he ($_izuku) first saw the supernatural . A crowd of them had been following him ($_izuku) , waiting for it to happen so they could greet the newest magic user . But not all of them had been friendly - an oni , a snake-headed man who had become something of a demon , and a few malicious fae had all targeted him ($_izuku) , hoping to steal his ($_izuku) power before he ($_izuku) could even use it . 
That was when he ($_izuku) d met Kazuha and the pink haired witch and her cat . Kazuha ($_kazuha) had been fending off the malevolent beings off the entire day , but it was the witch who had dispersed the crowd and escorted him ($_izuku) home safely . That day , she had hold him ($_izuku) what he ($_izuku) was capable of , and Kazuha ($_kazuha) agreed and offered to become his ($_izuku) familiar and protector . From there , however , Izuku ($_izuku) had to find his ($_izuku) own way through the craft . They all agreed that it would be better for him ($_izuku) to shape his ($_izuku) magic himself ($_izuku) than to have her do it for him ($_izuku) . 
Izuku , wall . Kazuha ($_kazuha) chirped . 
Wha- Oh! Izuku ($_izuku) looked up just in time to see the obstacle he ($_izuku) was about to run into . A few students at the gate giggled , but gave him ($_izuku) understanding smiles . After all , talking about the future was exhausting , they likely assumed he ($_izuku) was thinking about that still . Sheepishly , he ($_izuku) waved and ducked around the wall , darting away before he ($_izuku) could further embarrass himself ($_izuku) . 
Beyond pausing to greet the people around the area - human and nonhuman alike - the walk home was surprisingly uneventful , up until a point . A part of the duo wished it had remained so . Under a bridge , Izuku ($_izuku) watched the sky while Kazuha ($_kazuha) trailed along , occasionally stopping to sniff for something or another - as nice as being served a bowl of rice in the morning was , especially on days they gave her sides , she liked hunting too . 
That s when something loudly slithered out of a manhole cover , squishing and squirming together to reform into something coherent . At the sound , Izuku ($_izuku) whirled around , wide eyed , while Kazuha ($_kazuha) growled . 
Medium sized a nice body to hide in . It said and oh Gods that thing was a person wasn t it ? Somehow that made it so much worse . It - he tried to envelop the boy , but was pushed back by a gust of wind . He seemed to smile - and oh JEEZE it had teeth and eyes what the actual FUCK . 
A pretty good quirk , huh ? That s even better . he hissed , pulling back before trying again . This time , Izuku ($_izuku) summoned forth a wall of flames , backing up . It wasn t the first time he had to defend himself exactly , but it was the first time he 's ever had to actually fight , and his first time facing another human 
He was pretty sure the sludge guy was human , anyways . 
The sludge almost frowned - and Izuku ($_izuku) was never going to not be freaked out about a human sludge with eyes and teeth and the capability to emote . I m not playin around , kid . It won t hurt long if that s what you re worried about , but I don t have time for this . 
For a second , he glanced back towards the manhole , before directing a stare towards Izuku ($_izuku) and reaching out again , not caring if the flames Izuku ($_izuku) had summoned touched him in his attempt to restrain the boy . 
Kazuha ($_kazuha) growled , dropping her ($_kazuha) illusion - it didn t matter if the villain saw her ($_kazuha) , he still couldn t understand her ($_kazuha) . While Izuku ($_izuku) tried to force the man to keep away with his ($_izuku) fire , the fox spirit leapt onto him ($_izuku) , scratching and biting at his ($_izuku) eyes with vicious shrieks . With an enraged howl , it threw her ($_kazuha) off of him ($_izuku) , but it let Izuku ($_izuku) buy himself ($_izuku) enough time to scramble away . She ($_kazuha) immediately rolled back onto her ($_kazuha) feet , crouched down and growling even more . 
Just then , the cover went flying . Fear not , kid ! I am here ! A voice boomed . 
It was one that Izuku ($_izuku) would know anywhere . Out of the sewer popped All Might himself ($_izuku) , grinning brightly as he ($_izuku) pulled back his ($_izuku) fist and launched a Texas Smash - and oh man , he ($_izuku) was watching this , in person , in real life and no one would ever believe him ($_izuku) except maybe his ($_izuku) mom but oh WOW would this be a story someday ! The sludge villain was blasted away , and Izuku ($_izuku) ducked , narrowly avoiding being hit in the face by splatters of uh ... He ($_izuku) didn t want to think about it . 
Kazuha ($_kazuha) stood properly , glancing around at the mess while Izuku ($_izuku) couldn t help but stare in awe and glee alike . 
Sorry I was late ! The sewers are easy to get lost in . But it looks like you were handling it ! A flame quirk , eh ? All_Might ($_all) mused . 
Oh - uh - no , sir ! It was actually an illusion , to - to scare him ($_izuku) away ! Izuku ($_izuku) said , quickly snuffing out the fire with a wave of his ($_izuku) hand , though there was a definite effort to not squeal in his ($_izuku) voice . A few years earlier , and he ($_izuku) may have felt bad about lying to his ($_izuku) idol . D-Do you - how are you going to apprehend him ($_izuku) ? 
The three looked past where they stood , at the scattered and unconscious sludge . 
Well I do have these soda bottles . I was going to just put him ($_izuku) in one , bring him ($_izuku) down to the station . But it looks like he ($_izuku) s got more mass now 
Damn . All_Might ($_all) had been looking forward to that soda . 
P-Please ! Let me help ! You - You saved me after all ! 
All_Might ($_all) laughed , loud , but shook his head . No can do , kid ! I appreciate it , but this is a dangerous villain ! You should get going ! 
Kazuha ($_kazuha) yipped in agreement , startling the hero . He ($_kazuha) looked down and his ($_kazuha) smile almost faltered . 
A - A fox ? This far into the city ? 
Oh - uh - this is Kazuha , she - she s um she s domestic . And friendly , I promise ! Izuku ($_izuku) stammered . He ($_izuku) would never be comfortable implying she was his ($_izuku) pet , but well . How else was he ($_izuku) going to explain ? 
I see ! The two of you should get home , safe and sound then ! After all , I am sure Kazuha ($_kazuha) would hate to see anything else happen to you if you linger !! 
Again , she yipped in agreement , before pausing and pawing at the ground . She wouldn t be so cruel as to send him ($_izuku) away without letting him ($_izuku) ask a favor . 
No - yes - you re right , absolutely , but um - I - before I go could . I get an autograph ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked quietly , bowing deeply . 
Kazuha ($_kazuha) only watched fondly . That was her boy . Polite and shy , when he ($_izuku) didn t have to be brave or guarded . Though , the fact that this_man ($_izuku) was in fact his ($_izuku) idol and hero probably had a hand in that . 
All_Might ($_all) agreed with a hearty laugh , and gladly took the pen and notebook Izuku offered him ($_izuku) for a brief moment . 
Thank you ! So much! For - for everything I mean . It It was a great honor to meet you ! he ($_izuku) all but shouts when the hero returns his belongings , before scooping up Kazuha ($_kazuha) and turning around . 
All_Might ($_all) watched for a little bit , but quickly took a look around . The sludge man would be a mess to pick up , but he had to be fast before the main part of him woke up and escaped once more - he simply didn t have the energy to chase after him more , and there was a young boy in the area - probably even more civilians , given the time . Crouching down , All_Might ($_all) began his work . That s when he noticed something . 
Scorch marks ? 
The hero glanced up - the boy was still close , probably taking a slower pace for his ankle , stiff as a board mid-step with the fox equally stiff in his arms . He was pretty certain that he had said it was an illusion quirk , but last he checked Illusions didn t cause actual damage . Now that he thought about it , the air smelt of burning sewage -LRB- goodness , he was going to need a shower later -RRB- and some parts of the villain even suffered some burns . 
Now why would he lie about something like this ? 
This was no illusion , was it ?
