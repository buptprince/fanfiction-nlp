The first thing Eijirou ($_eijirou) saw when he ($_eijirou) woke up was brown . 
He ($_eijirou) blinked , letting his ($_eijirou) eyes adjust to the light . Everything was out of focus but he ($_eijirou) slowly became aware of warmth and the softness of fur wrapped around him ($_eijirou) . Next to him ($_eijirou) was the crackle and smoke of a fire , and for a moment he ($_eijirou) thought he ($_eijirou) was back in the town , its houses collapsing into cinders and its streets splattered with blood . 
He ($_eijirou) gasped and tried to sit up but the shooting pain in his ($_eijirou) side had him ($_eijirou) on his ($_eijirou) back in seconds . He ($_eijirou) hissed , his ($_eijirou) hand feeling along his ($_eijirou) torso . 
The first thing he ($_eijirou) noticed was that he ($_eijirou) wasn t wearing a shirt . Instead of worn cloth and armor under his ($_eijirou) fingers , bandages crisscrossed in an intricate pattern over his ($_eijirou) chest and along his ($_eijirou) arms . He ($_eijirou) glanced at them and could just make out dried blood stains before he ($_eijirou) got too dizzy and had to lie back down . 
He ($_eijirou) had lost a lot of blood . But he ($_eijirou) was also a warrior and had been through worse situations than this . He ($_eijirou) d live . 
He ($_eijirou) closed his ($_eijirou) eyes and took a deep breath , wincing as the movement made his ($_eijirou) wounds pull across his ($_eijirou) skin . First thing s first , he ($_eijirou) needed to figure out just how big of a mess he ($_eijirou) was in . 
He ($_eijirou) opened his ($_eijirou) eyes and glanced around , trying to take in as much as he ($_eijirou) could without moving . The cave was a small one , just large enough to accommodate a small campsite . Outside , the rain was coming down in icy torrents , but inside the shelter of the cave , it was warm and dry - almost cozy . It was such a contrast to the town in his memories that he blinked , trying to remember how he d gotten here . All he could remember were bandits , flames , a child screaming through the smoke . 
Shoving Midoriya and the child out of the house before the whole thing came down on top of them . 
Then nothing . 
Clearly , someone had brought him here . On the opposite side of the fire , he could just make out piles of food and a roll of clothes nestled in a mound of fur . Whoever it had been , they wouldn t be gone for long . 
Lightning flashed outside then , and the ensuing roll of thunder made him look towards the cave entrance . 
He froze . 
Standing just on the edge of the fire s light was a man . He was tall , maybe taller than Eijirou ($_eijirou) , and built but still lean , like he had been hardened by life in the wilderness . 
For a moment they just watched each other , the only noise the pounding of the rain . Then lightning struck behind him , silhouetting the man , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) twisted himself as subtly as he could , trying to conceal the hand that had snuck out to grasp for a weapon . 
His fingers groped along his leg , but not only did he not find the dagger he always kept hidden there , but there were no clothes either . 
He was completely naked . 
He yelped , moving to draw the furs tighter around himself , and hissed as pain shot up his arm . Almost as soon as the sound left his mouth , the stranger was at his side , crossing the cave in three quick strides . 
He crouched beside him and Eijirou ($_eijirou) braced himself for the worst . 
But all the man did was give him a once over before setting a canteen beside him . Then he backed off , circling around the fire to plop down on the mound of furs . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) watched him . 
Now that the man was near the fire , his features were clearly visible and there was a course beauty about him , something dangerous and sharp like the way a dragon s scales glint in the sun just before the kill . He was blond , young - probably around Eijirou ($_eijirou) s age - and wore no shirt , just animal teeth necklaces , leather bracers , and thick pants suitable for the mountains . 
Who are you ? Eijirou ($_eijirou) asked and the man s eyes flashed up to meet him ($_eijirou) but his ($_eijirou) expression didn t change ; he ($_eijirou) must not know what Eijirou ($_eijirou) was saying . 
A barbarian then . Eijirou ($_eijirou) swallowed . 
Or at least , he ($_eijirou) tried to swallow . His ($_eijirou) throat was so dry he ($_eijirou) couldn t quite do it . He ($_eijirou) glanced down at the canteen beside him ($_eijirou) . The_barbarian ($_eijirou) had looked away already , busy pulling bags of herbs out of his ($_eijirou) stockpile of food to chew them , so he ($_eijirou) cautiously reached out and gave it an experimental shake . The canteen was nearly full to bursting . 
He ($_eijirou) knew Iida ($_iida) would tell him ($_eijirou) to exercise caution but he ($_eijirou) just couldn t . It took almost all of his ($_eijirou) willpower just to hold off long enough to make sure the contents were actually water before greedily gulping the entire thing down . 
He ($_eijirou) drank so fast that it went down his ($_eijirou) windpipe and he ($_eijirou) coughed , groaning as pain racked his ($_eijirou) chest . But before he ($_eijirou) could spill it , a hand reached out to take the canteen from him ($_eijirou) . He ($_eijirou) peeked through teary eyes to see the stranger right next to him ($_eijirou) , grumbling under his ($_eijirou) breath in another language - something sharp and rough and impossible to understand . 
Then he ($_eijirou) reached for Eijirou ($_eijirou) s bandages . 
Automatically Eijirou ($_eijirou) tried to scoot away , but the attempt only caused more pain and this time the_barbarian ($_eijirou) s words were clear , his ($_eijirou) hand clamping down on Eijirou ($_eijirou) s wrist like iron . 
IDIOT , he ($_eijirou) yelled and Eijirou ($_eijirou) flinched . STAY . 
He ($_eijirou) didn t say anything else , glaring him ($_eijirou) into submission , and eventually , Eijirou ($_eijirou) nodded . That seemed to mollify him ($_eijirou) somewhat and the_barbarian ($_eijirou) clicked his ($_eijirou) tongue , going back to whatever it was he ($_eijirou) d been doing . He ($_eijirou) was quick and efficient , deftly unwrapping the bandages with gentle hands , and a small part of Eijirou ($_eijirou) marveled at that . Everything about the_barbarian ($_eijirou) was so unexpected , from his ($_eijirou) light touch to his ($_eijirou) apparently shaky grasp of English . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) blushed as the fingers brushed along his ($_eijirou) chest . While the stranger had been moving him ($_eijirou) this way and that , the fur had been sliding down his ($_eijirou) back until it pooled around him ($_eijirou) , barely covering his ($_eijirou) waist . He ($_eijirou) couldn t understand it . He ($_eijirou) was a warrior . He ($_eijirou) d been hurt many times over and Uraraka , Jirou , and Iida ($_iida) had often tended to his ($_iida) wounds , but his ($_iida) skin had never jumped under their fingers , nor had it flushed with blood until it tingled all over . Not like this . 
The thought weighed heavy on him ($_iida) and he ($_iida) cleared his ($_iida) throat to dispel the tension . You re really good at this . 
But the_barbarian ($_eijirou) said nothing , not even a grunt of acknowledgement , and he ($_eijirou) squeezed his ($_eijirou) eyes shut , resigning himself ($_eijirou) to endure the touches in silence . The man had moved behind him ($_eijirou) now , setting a bowl with the chewed herbs down beside them as he ($_eijirou) propped Eijirou ($_eijirou) up so that they were back to chest . He ($_eijirou) could feel the difference in the span of their shoulders - the way the man was able to curl around him ($_eijirou) and envelop him ($_eijirou) in the musk wafting off skin still slick and cold with rain . 
He ($_eijirou) hoped to the gods that the man couldn t feel his ($_eijirou) heart pounding through his ($_eijirou) skin . 
He ($_eijirou) shivered and the_barbarian ($_eijirou) steadied him ($_eijirou) , splaying a warm hand over his ($_eijirou) side . Then he ($_eijirou) swiped his ($_eijirou) fingers through the mush in the bowl and spread it over Eijirou ($_eijirou) s wounds . Eijirou ($_eijirou) winced , gritting his ($_eijirou) teeth against the pain . Even touching the area around the wounds sent sparks firing up his ($_eijirou) spine . He ($_eijirou) glanced down , trying to see the extent of the damage , and his ($_eijirou) stomach rolled . His ($_eijirou) torso was mottled with bruises , burns , and the black red of deep gashes . 
He ($_eijirou) looked like a house had fallen on him ($_eijirou) . 
He ($_eijirou) swallowed , looking away , and behind him ($_eijirou) , the_barbarian ($_eijirou) hummed , a deep soothing sound meant to calm spooked animals . But Eijirou ($_eijirou) couldn t find it in himself ($_eijirou) to be irritated at being treated like a beast . Whatever the reason it was working . 
As gentle as the_barbarian ($_eijirou) was , Eijirou ($_eijirou) was still worn out by the time they ($_eijirou) finished . The herbs had a soothing quality of their ($_eijirou) own , numbing the pain enough to make sleep possible . His ($_eijirou) head drooped over and over again as the man wrapped him ($_eijirou) back up in clean bandages then helped him ($_eijirou) down to rest . But before the man could retreat to the other side of the campfire , Eijirou ($_eijirou) snagged his ($_eijirou) pants leg . 
They hadn t talked nearly at all since he ($_eijirou) d woken up in the cave and at the very least he ($_eijirou) needed to say one thing . 
I m Kirishima Eijirou , he ($_eijirou) said , his ($_eijirou) words muddled with sleep ($_sleep) . 
The_barbarian ($_eijirou) paused and looked at him ($_eijirou) . For a moment he ($_eijirou) didn t think the man would respond . Sleep ($_sleep) was fast overtaking him ($_eijirou) and his ($_eijirou) grip on the pants had already loosened . But before he ($_eijirou) could drift off completely , he ($_eijirou) heard it through the darkness . 
Bakugou Katsuki . 
---
When Eijirou ($_eijirou) next woke up , it was to the feeling of Bakugou s leg sliding between his ($_eijirou) thighs . His ($_eijirou) eyes flew open , a strangled squeak on his ($_eijirou) lips , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) only shifted , his ($_eijirou) arms tightening around him ($_eijirou) as they spooned . 
For a moment , Eijirou ($_eijirou) didn t know what to do . On the one hand , he ($_eijirou) was warm , much warmer than he ($_eijirou) had been before . Bakugou ($_bakugou) gave off heat like it was his ($_bakugou) job and that was good since their fire had gone out overnight , their breath fogging in the cool morning air . But on the other , he ($_bakugou) was fairly sure Bakugou ($_bakugou) was naked . 
To make matters worse , he ($_bakugou) needed to pee . Badly. 
Okay , calm down , calm down , he ($_bakugou) breathed . Behind him ($_bakugou) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) sighed and the air tickled along his ($_bakugou) neck , making his ($_bakugou) skin break out into goosebumps and his ($_bakugou) heart rate skyrocket . I-I ll just wiggle out of here and piss and by the time I get back , he ($_bakugou) ll be awake . No biggie . 
He ($_bakugou) nodded and took a deep breath , bracing himself ($_bakugou) for a wave of pain . But when he ($_bakugou) shifted , it wasn t nearly as bad as he ($_bakugou) expected . Whatever herbs Bakugou ($_bakugou) had used on him ($_bakugou) had worked wonders overnight - he ($_bakugou) was still a long ways away from healed but at least the pain was tolerable . 
He ($_bakugou) shifted again . Bakugou ($_bakugou) had slipped an arm underneath his ($_bakugou) head and curled the other around his ($_bakugou) torso , and it was hard work trying to slip away without disturbing him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) had almost made it , one foot in the icy morning air , when suddenly a hand shot out and dragged him ($_bakugou) back in , burying him ($_bakugou) underneath the furs . Eijirou ($_eijirou) yelped , trying to adjust to the darkness . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was on top of him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) had Eijirou ($_eijirou) caged in with his ($_bakugou) elbows and their faces were only inches away from each other . 
He ($_bakugou) stared at the_barbarian ($_eijirou) , eyes wide . This close and enveloped in the furs like they were , it was impossible not to smell that musk again - oaky and thick like embers on a fire . Above him ($_bakugou) Bakugou ($_bakugou) was glaring , his ($_bakugou) teeth bared , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) s groin throbbed , but whether it was his ($_bakugou) bladder or arousal he ($_bakugou) couldn t tell . All he ($_bakugou) could focus on was the overwhelming urge to submit , like if he ($_bakugou) could just throw his ($_bakugou) head back and show his ($_bakugou) neck like a good little bitch he ($_bakugou) might find he ($_bakugou) liked what came next . 
It scared him ($_bakugou) - and more importantly , it scared him ($_bakugou) how close he ($_bakugou) came to doing it anyway . 
So instead he ($_bakugou) kept his ($_bakugou) chin low and bared his ($_bakugou) teeth . He ($_bakugou) already knew it was a lost cause - he ($_bakugou) was injured and weak and Bakugou ($_bakugou) was in peak health - but his ($_bakugou) pride as a man wouldn t let him ($_bakugou) just roll over without a fight . They struggled , Bakugou ($_bakugou) grappling to pin Eijirou ($_eijirou) s arms and legs while Eijirou ($_eijirou) fought to push him ($_bakugou) away . 
It was over almost as soon as it began . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) panted , his ($_eijirou) muscles and bladder screaming in protest . The_barbarian ($_eijirou) was growling now , a near constant sound that was closer to animal than anything a human throat could produce . It was terrifying , a primal fear that made him ($_eijirou) think of night and shadows and eyes glowing in the underbrush . 
But even more terrifying was his ($_eijirou) morning wood threatening to jab into Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hip at the slightest movement . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) glanced down and immediately looked away , the image of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s huge uncut dick hanging over his ($_eijirou) bare stomach burned into his ($_eijirou) retinas . His ($_eijirou) own dick twitched and he ($_eijirou) squirmed . He ($_eijirou) wanted to clamp a hand on himself ($_eijirou) to keep from bursting , but tugging on the arm pinned in Bakugou ($_bakugou) s grip in the hopes he ($_eijirou) would magically understand only made the growling intensify , the_barbarian ($_eijirou) s fingers gripping him ($_eijirou) so tight it made Eijirou ($_eijirou) wince . He ($_eijirou) was going to have to say it . 
I need to piss , he ($_eijirou) muttered , his ($_eijirou) cheeks ablaze . 
The growl abruptly cut off . He ($_eijirou) was still resolutely looking away but he ($_eijirou) could sense Bakugou ($_bakugou) s glance downward and somehow managed to blush even harder . 
Now , he ($_eijirou) clarified . 
A few seconds passed . Bakugou didn t move and for a horrifying moment , Eijirou ($_eijirou) thought he ($_eijirou) wouldn t . But eventually , the_barbarian ($_eijirou) sat up , throwing off the blankets and exposing them to the chill morning air . 
He ($_eijirou) grunted , extending a hand , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) took it gratefully , looking at anything and everything but the man s body as Bakugou ($_bakugou) helped him ($_eijirou) to his ($_eijirou) feet . They shuffled to the cave entrance and for the first time , Eijirou ($_eijirou) caught of glimpse of the new terrain . 
He ($_eijirou) gasped . 
They were high in the face of the mountains , nothing but forests and hills all around them . The sun had only just come up over the horizon and in the deep violet of the sky he ($_eijirou) could just make out the form of something flying among the clouds - a wyvern or dragon maybe ? It was vast and wild and beautiful - and no matter how he ($_eijirou) craned his ($_eijirou) neck , he ($_eijirou) couldn t see any clearing that might hint at the town he ($_eijirou) had been in just days ago . 
Or a bathroom . 
What are you doing ? he ($_eijirou) asked as Bakugou ($_bakugou) led him ($_eijirou) forward but the man didn t answer . Just beyond the entrance was a ledge running the length of the mountain s side but he ($_eijirou) doubted they would be able to hobble down it together , or even that his ($_eijirou) bladder would last that long . He ($_eijirou) didn t want to think Bakugou ($_bakugou) would be the type to throw men off cliffs just for needing to pee but then again he ($_eijirou) hardly knew the guy . 
They came to a stop just before the edge and Eijirou ($_eijirou) tensed , waiting ... then breathed a sigh of relief when no shove seemed forthcoming . Bakugou ($_bakugou) wanted him ($_eijirou) to pee off the side . A little embarrassing but a little cool too. He ($_eijirou) d never thought of peeing from a cliff face before but now it was something he ($_eijirou) could cross off his ($_eijirou) bucket list . 
He ($_eijirou) tried to take his ($_eijirou) arm back from where it was draped over Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulders but Bakugou ($_bakugou) held firm , their bodies touching from shoulder to hip . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) frowned . 
Alright , he ($_eijirou) said , slightly nervous now , you can let me ($_eijirou) go . I ($_eijirou) won t escape , I ($_eijirou) promise . 
But the_barbarian ($_eijirou) just gave him ($_eijirou) a flat stare , stubborn and unmoving . Eijirou ($_eijirou) s bladder gave him ($_eijirou) a warning clench and he ($_eijirou) grimaced , a few drops of piss ($_piss) leaking out before he ($_eijirou) could stop them . 
I can do it myself , he ($_eijirou) begged , his ($_eijirou) face flushing all over again . He ($_eijirou) was about to wet himself ($_eijirou) if this barbarian didn t let go of him ($_eijirou) but the guy didn t seem to get the picture . Instead of backing off Bakugou ($_bakugou) just scrutinized him ($_eijirou) , cataloging every inch of his ($_eijirou) face like he ($_eijirou) had never seen a man who wanted to piss in peace before , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) was desperate now , his ($_eijirou) knees knocking together and body bending to try to hold it in . 
Please , he ($_eijirou) tried again , voice almost breaking under the strain . He ($_eijirou) had his ($_eijirou) hand clenched over his ($_eijirou) crotch to hold himself ($_eijirou) back but if they waited any longer that wouldn t matter . 
Finally , Bakugou ($_bakugou) spoke . 
Piss , he ($_eijirou) said and Eijirou ($_eijirou) looked up at him ($_eijirou) hopefully , searching for some sign of comprehension . But Bakugou ($_bakugou) s face only showed a hint of confusion and a whole lot of intrigue . Like the answer was obvious . Piss ($_piss) , he ($_eijirou) said again and Eijirou ($_eijirou) s face fell . It wasn t a statement , it was an order . 
I-I can t , he ($_eijirou) stammered . He ($_eijirou) had gone into the woods with friends to take a leak before but never like this . Never with someone this ... close . But the_barbarian ($_eijirou) only stepped behind him ($_eijirou) , sliding his ($_eijirou) hands around his ($_eijirou) waist to massage just above his ($_eijirou) dick . Wait, wait! Eijirou ($_eijirou) yelped . He ($_eijirou) gripped Bakugou ($_bakugou) s forearm as he ($_eijirou) curled in on himself ($_eijirou) but Bakugou ($_bakugou) only curled with him ($_eijirou) , their bodies pressed tightly together and his ($_eijirou) chin resting on Eijirou ($_eijirou) s shoulder . 
Piss ($_piss) , he ($_eijirou) said into Eijirou ($_eijirou) s ear , his ($_eijirou) warm , rough hand sliding along his ($_eijirou) dick and balls , holding him ($_eijirou) while the other probed harder at his ($_eijirou) stomach . Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped . Piss ($_piss) was dribbling out of his ($_eijirou) slit now and his ($_eijirou) bladder was burning with the effort to hold it in but it was torture . He ($_eijirou) writhed , trying to push back into Bakugou ($_bakugou) and away from the hand pressing his ($_eijirou) lower stomach but it was like pushing back into a wall . There was no space and with every passing second , the_barbarian ($_eijirou) probed deeper and deeper , prodding over and over again until Eijirou ($_eijirou) couldn t breathe with the want to piss . 
Eventually , he ($_eijirou) couldn t hold it anymore . 
Fuck , he ($_eijirou) whispered , quiet and breathless as his ($_eijirou) muscles fluttered once , twice , then finally let go . 
At first , only dribbles came out , a weak stream that coursed down his ($_eijirou) leg and splattered against the rock of the ledge . But it got stronger and stronger until it was gushing , so hot it sent steam flowing into the air . Eijirou ($_eijirou) groaned , deep and guttural . It was such a relief that his ($_eijirou) legs buckled , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand that had been kneading his ($_eijirou) stomach slid up to support his ($_eijirou) chest and keep him ($_eijirou) upright . 
It s g-getting on you , Eijirou ($_eijirou) whimpered , leaning his ($_eijirou) head back until it rested on Bakugou s shoulder . But the_man ($_eijirou) only hummed , a soothing sound that vibrated against his ($_eijirou) back while Eijirou ($_eijirou) panted and groaned , staring up at the sky as the man milked his ($_eijirou) dick and balls through the whole thing - like a reward for doing so well . 
When it finally stopped he ($_eijirou) was a shaking mess . He ($_eijirou) was sure his ($_eijirou) face must be as red as his ($_eijirou) hair , and not only because he ($_eijirou) had pissed for more than a minute in front of a complete stranger . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was hard . He ($_bakugou) couldn t tell exactly when it had happened but he ($_bakugou) could feel the hot , thick length of it sliding between his ($_bakugou) ass cheeks . They were still pressed together back to chest , Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand loosely wrapped around his ($_bakugou) limp dick , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) wondered if he ($_bakugou) could feel his ($_bakugou) heart pounding in his ($_bakugou) chest . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) shifted , sliding a considering hand down Eijirou ($_eijirou) s dick to test its ($_bakugou) girth , stopping to cup his ($_bakugou) balls and feel the weight of them in his ($_bakugou) palm . Eijirou ($_eijirou) shivered , holding his ($_eijirou) breath . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) just let him ($_bakugou) go , leading him ($_bakugou) back to the bed and wrapping him ($_bakugou) back up in the furs . Stay , he ($_bakugou) said when he ($_bakugou) was done . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) stared up at him ($_bakugou) wide-eyed , his ($_eijirou) gaze fixated on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hands and pointedly not on the cock curving up his ($_eijirou) stomach and flushed a deep red at the tip . But eventually he ($_eijirou) blinked , nodding , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) grunted , placing a few pieces of fruit from his ($_eijirou) stockpile by the makeshift bed of fur before pulling on his ($_eijirou) pants and leaving the cave . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) watched him ($_eijirou) go . Then he ($_eijirou) collapsed back onto the furs , cupping his ($_eijirou) face in his ($_eijirou) hands to hide his ($_eijirou) blush . 
What had just happened? And , more importantly , why had he ($_eijirou) liked it ? 
---
By the time night fell Bakugou ($_bakugou) still wasn t back . Eijirou ($_eijirou) sat with his ($_eijirou) hands to the fire he ($_eijirou) had lit , furs wrapped around him ($_eijirou) to protect him ($_eijirou) from the cold , and tried to deal with all of the questions running through his ($_eijirou) mind . When would Bakugou ($_bakugou) return ? Should he ($_eijirou) wait for him ($_eijirou) or go out looking ? It was already cold outside and the temperature was still dropping - what if he ($_eijirou) was injured ? 
He ($_eijirou) caught himself ($_eijirou) staring out of the cave entrance into the night and shook himself ($_eijirou) , frowning as he ($_eijirou) ran a hand through his ($_eijirou) hair . He ($_eijirou) sounded like a wife waiting for her husband . What the hell was he ($_eijirou) doing thinking about this stuff ? Sure , the_barbarian ($_eijirou) had helped him ($_eijirou) out in a pinch but Eijirou ($_eijirou) still had no idea what his ($_eijirou) intentions were . 
He ($_eijirou) thought of the incident that morning and quickly pushed it from his ($_eijirou) mind , blushing . He ($_eijirou) had more pressing matters to think about . 
For example , he ($_eijirou) still had no explanation for what had happened in the last few days . And with no idea how long he ($_eijirou) d been in the cave and no way to contact anyone , there was no telling where Midoriya and the rest of their gang were now . He ($_eijirou) didn t think they would just leave him ($_eijirou) behind , but you could never tell in situations like these . The town had been a mess - who knew what kind of crises the others had run into . 
He ($_eijirou) scowled , staring into the depths of the fire . Worrying didn t suit him ($_eijirou) . He ($_eijirou) was a man and real men took action . 
Quickly he ($_eijirou) threw the furs off and crossed around the fire , searching for the roll of clothes he ($_eijirou) d seen before . They weren t his ($_eijirou) normal wear but that didn t matter . If nothing else he ($_eijirou) had to figure out where he ($_eijirou) was , and he ($_eijirou) d prefer not to do that naked . 
When he ($_eijirou) was dressed , he ($_eijirou) stepped out onto the ledge at the cave entrance and looked around . It was a full moon out , not a cloud in the sky , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) grinned . Perfect conditions for stargazing . 
He ($_eijirou) peered up into the sky , searching for familiar constellations , and blinked . If he ($_eijirou) was reading his ($_eijirou) position correctly , he ($_eijirou) had ended up far west of the town . Sometime between his ($_eijirou) memories of the town and waking up in the cave he ($_eijirou) had apparently managed to cross the mountain range . 
That couldn t be right . 
He ($_eijirou) looked at the ledge he ($_eijirou) was on , following it with his ($_eijirou) eyes . On his ($_eijirou) left , it seemed to continue down the mountain and into the forest , but on his ($_eijirou) right , he ($_eijirou) could work out a path to get closer to the peak . He ($_eijirou) would have to do a little rock climbing but he ($_eijirou) was much closer to the top than to the bottom . With his ($_eijirou) quirk , he ($_eijirou) d make it up there in no time . 
Careful , careful , he ($_eijirou) muttered as he ($_eijirou) shimmied along the ledge to his ($_eijirou) right . There was technically enough space to walk somewhat normally but the rock looked a bit crumbly and the last thing he ($_eijirou) wanted to do was rush and end up plunging off the side . Even with his ($_eijirou) hardening that would be a pain . 
Slowly but surely he ($_eijirou) gained some altitude , and by the time the ledge he ($_eijirou) was on began to taper off , the wind was snapping at his ($_eijirou) hair and clothes like an animal . It was time to start climbing . He ($_eijirou) took a moment to test his ($_eijirou) bandages , then hardened himself ($_eijirou) and got started cutting hand and footholds . 
It was harder than he ($_eijirou) imagined . Before he ($_eijirou) would have been able to scale this much no problem . But now , with his ($_eijirou) bruises making him ($_eijirou) wince every five seconds , it was slower going than he ($_eijirou) would have liked . Thankfully the hardening stopped his ($_eijirou) wounds from getting too much worse in the moment , but he ($_eijirou) was sure there would be hell to pay for this later . 
Eventually , though , he ($_eijirou) did reach the top . And at least now that he ($_eijirou) had already done the hard work of creating the holds , going down would be easier than coming up . He ($_eijirou) was still crazy tired though . Hands on his ($_eijirou) knees , he ($_eijirou) released his ($_eijirou) hardening and peered out at the terrain on the other side of the mountain . 
He ($_eijirou) grinned . 
Over on this side , the forest was less dense with plenty of clearings , any one of which could be the town he ($_eijirou) d been in . So not too far then. 
Still , how the hell did I get over here ? he ($_eijirou) muttered , scratching his ($_eijirou) head . Even by horse , it looked to be at least a week s worth of travel from the town to the mountains . Sure his ($_eijirou) wounds had been bad but he ($_eijirou) couldn t have been out for that long , right ? 
Suddenly a huge gust of wind hit him ($_eijirou) from behind . He ($_eijirou) yelped , nearly falling to his ($_eijirou) knees but pivoted at the last minute , hand up to shield his ($_eijirou) eyes from the gale . 
What the - he ($_eijirou) cried , then stopped . 
In front of him ($_eijirou) was a black dragon more than 10 times his ($_eijirou) size with white eyes and huge leathery wings that buffeted the ground and sent gusts of wind so powerful that they pushed Eijirou ($_eijirou) back a step . It had alighted on the cliff face and blended in so perfectly that he ($_eijirou) almost couldn t see it if not for the silver shine of the moon on its scales . 
He ($_eijirou) stared . It was beautiful . 
Then a second later it opened its mouth and unleashed a firestorm . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped , immediately hardening to shield himself ($_eijirou) from the blaze . But the temperature was still blistering and he ($_eijirou) knew he ($_eijirou) wouldn t be able to last much longer , even if his ($_eijirou) quirk wasn t almost exhausted . 
So he ($_eijirou) made a run for it . 
The mountaintop was filled with crags and Eijirou ($_eijirou) sprinted to the nearest one he ($_eijirou) could find , slipping in just as the_dragon ($_the) unleashed another bout of flames . The fire crashed against the rock , so bright that Eijirou ($_eijirou) had to look away , and when it finally stopped the rock was sizzling . It was like standing next to hot coals . If he ($_eijirou) stayed here any longer he ($_eijirou) was going to get cooked . 
The nearest crag was too far away and the_dragon ($_the) was much faster than him ($_eijirou) - there wasn t anywhere he ($_eijirou) could run that it wouldn t be able to intercept . He ($_eijirou) would have to stand and fight . Above him ($_eijirou) , the flames were burning from red to white as the_dragon ($_the) got closer and closer and Eijirou ($_eijirou) wiped the sweat from his ($_eijirou) eyes . It ($_the) was now or never . 
He ($_eijirou) summoned all of his ($_eijirou) strength and hardened , pushing it until he ($_eijirou) hit his ($_eijirou) max . The_dragon ($_the) was so close the inside of its ($_the) mouth was like looking into the sun . 
He ($_eijirou) only had 30 seconds . He ($_eijirou) had to go now . 
Eat this , you overgrown lizard ! he ($_eijirou) screamed as he ($_eijirou) vaulted out of the crags , leaping off the rock and slamming a fist into the_dragon_s_eye ($_the) . 
The_dragon ($_the) roared , its ($_the) flames abruptly cutting off as it ($_the) swung its ($_the) head to the side , flinging Eijirou ($_eijirou) 50 feet wide . He ($_eijirou) slammed down centimeters from the edge , all the air punching out of his ($_eijirou) lungs the moment he ($_eijirou) hit rock and black spots dancing in front of his ($_eijirou) eyes . 
But he ($_eijirou) was still skidding . He ($_eijirou) was going to slide right off the edge . 
With the last of his ($_eijirou) max hardening , he ($_eijirou) slammed a hand down into the rock face , holding on for dear life as his ($_eijirou) quirk cave out . He ($_eijirou) wouldn t be able to do that again any time soon . 
The_dragon ($_the) shook its ($_the) head and swiveled to look for him ($_eijirou) . It ($_the) would see him ($_eijirou) as soon as he ($_eijirou) got up , but he ($_eijirou) couldn t stay where he ($_eijirou) was , his ($_eijirou) fingers were already trembling with the strain . 
Fuck , he ($_eijirou) hissed . 
He ($_eijirou) pulled himself ($_eijirou) back onto solid ground , muscles screaming , and the_dragon ($_the) snarled as it ($_the) rounded its ($_the) head , immediately honing in on him ($_eijirou) . It ($_the) roared , wings spread wide as it ($_the) reared up . 
He ($_eijirou) had to move . His ($_eijirou) legs were shaking from exhaustion and he ($_eijirou) gritted his ($_eijirou) teeth , punching them to get them working again . He ($_eijirou) had to move . 
Then Bakugou ($_bakugou) fell from the sky . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) jumped as the_man ($_eijirou) landed almost on top of him ($_eijirou) , his ($_eijirou) hand gripping the back of Eijirou ($_eijirou) s neck and shoving down until he ($_eijirou) was nearly flat on the ground . It was so sudden it scared the_black_dragon ($_the) too and it flared its wings , backing off and hissing to assess the new threat . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) snarled at it , brandishing his ($_bakugou) free hand at the beast and daring it to come closer . In his ($_bakugou) palm explosions went off one after another , loud and bright and unlike anything Eijirou ($_eijirou) had ever seen . 
Nearby there was the flap of wings as another dragon landed , this one the same bright red as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes . It too faced off against the_black_dragon ($_the) , roaring and flapping its wings at the enemy in its territory , 
For a long second , nobody moved , all three of them locked in a stalemate with Eijirou watching from the ground . 
But the explosions in Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand were only getting bigger and that was enough . Prey that fought back was evidently not worth a fight with two new enemies and the_black_dragon ($_the) dove off the side of the mountain , roaring one last time at them as it ($_the) flew away . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) watched it ($_the) go , completely still . Eijirou ($_eijirou) could see him ($_bakugou) out of the corner of his ($_bakugou) eye but the man didn t look at him ($_bakugou) . Now that it was just the three of them , the silence that had been so peaceful when Eijirou ($_eijirou) had first arrived at the mountain s peak was suddenly oppressive . 
They waited and waited until Eijirou ($_eijirou) s heart was hammering in his ($_eijirou) chest . Then finally , when the_dragon ($_the) s silhouette had disappeared over the horizon , Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned to look down at him ($_eijirou) . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) paled . 
It ($_the) was an accident ! he ($_eijirou) squeaked as the_man ($_eijirou) dragged him ($_eijirou) up by the back of his ($_eijirou) neck . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s face screamed bloody murder and Eijirou ($_eijirou) was sweating harder now than when he ($_eijirou) d been fighting for his ($_eijirou) life . He ($_eijirou) couldn t help feeling like between the barbarian and the_black_dragon ($_the) he ($_eijirou) had drawn the short end of the stick . I was just checking the constellations - 
SHUT UP! Bakugou ($_bakugou) roared and Eijirou ($_eijirou) s mouth snapped shut . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s gaze flicked down to assess the damage and he ($_eijirou) followed suit . He ($_eijirou) winced . His ($_eijirou) wounds must have opened up again during the fight because his ($_eijirou) shirt was slick with blood . Bakugou ($_bakugou) somehow managed to get even angrier when he ($_eijirou) saw it , his ($_eijirou) mouth twisting . He ($_eijirou) let loose a string of harsh words in that other language , ending in a harsh MOVE as he ($_eijirou) pushed Eijirou ($_eijirou) forward towards the_red_dragon ($_the) . 
Wait, what? he ($_eijirou) yelped as the_dragon ($_the) kneeled , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) only snarled at him ($_eijirou) , manhandling him ($_eijirou) until he ($_eijirou) was seated above the beast s wing joints . Once he ($_eijirou) was steady , the_man ($_eijirou) swung up after him ($_eijirou) , slotting himself ($_eijirou) right behind . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) blushed . Like this , Bakugou ($_bakugou) s entire front was pressed against his ($_bakugou) back , so close that he ($_bakugou) could feel the other s erratic heartbeat through his ($_bakugou) clothes . And it only got worse as Bakugou ($_bakugou) threaded his ($_bakugou) arms through Eijirou ($_eijirou) s , leaning forward until he ($_bakugou) could pat his ($_bakugou) palms against the scaly beast s neck . 
The_dragon ($_the) perked up , getting to its ($_the) feet and moving towards the edge as it ($_the) shook out its ($_the) wings . From this angle , he ($_bakugou) could see the entire cliff face stretching out before them into the dark depths of the forest canopy below . It was a sheer drop . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) swallowed . 
I ve never ridden a dragon before , he ($_bakugou) said as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s arms tightened around his ($_bakugou) waist , pulling him ($_bakugou) back to fit snugly in the pocket of his ($_bakugou) thighs . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) just grinned , sharp and feral against his ($_bakugou) neck . 
Then they dived head first over the edge . 
---
By the time they arrived at the ledge of their cave , Eijirou ($_eijirou) was shaking . 
Holy shit , he ($_bakugou) said as the_dragon ($_the) latched onto the side of the mountain , its ($_the) claws embedded in the cliff face . That plunge over the side had shot his ($_bakugou) stomach straight into his ($_bakugou) throat - and the ride hadn t gotten any smoother from there - but it had been exhilarating . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was still pressed tightly to his ($_bakugou) back but he ($_bakugou) didn t even notice , too starry-eyed to focus on much else besides getting back onto the ledge . As soon as he ($_bakugou) did , he ($_bakugou) collapsed onto his ($_bakugou) back , smiling up at the ceiling . 
That was amazing , he ($_bakugou) sighed . He ($_bakugou) d heard about dragon riders but they were more myth than anything , a story told around campfires . He ($_bakugou) d never imagined he ($_bakugou) d get to be one . 
He ($_bakugou) laughed once , breathy and stunned , then looked up at the crunch of boots on rock . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was standing above him ($_bakugou) , rolling his ($_bakugou) eyes at Eijirou ($_eijirou) s dopey face . The flight had calmed him ($_bakugou) somewhat - he ($_bakugou) d gotten some kind of secondhand rush out of seeing Eijirou ($_eijirou) s eyes tear up when they took off , Eijirou ($_eijirou) was sure of it - but he ($_bakugou) was still pissed , a tangible tension hanging in the air . 
Thanks for saving me , man ! Eijirou ($_eijirou) hurried to say in an attempt to break the silence . He ($_eijirou) rubbed the back of his ($_eijirou) head as he ($_eijirou) made to sit up . Are explosions your quirk ? Because they re super cool - But before he ($_eijirou) had even made it halfway up , Bakugou ($_bakugou) was there , pushing him ($_eijirou) back down again and crouching over him ($_eijirou) until his ($_eijirou) back was pressed into the rock . 
The words dried up in Eijirou ($_eijirou) s throat . 
He ($_eijirou) had been stalked by a cougar once before he ($_eijirou) had met up with Midoriya and the rest of his ($_eijirou) crew and started their quest . He ($_eijirou) remembered the way his ($_eijirou) skin had prickled , hyper-aware of a predator in his ($_eijirou) midst . How his ($_eijirou) heartbeat had seemed slow and deliberate as his ($_eijirou) eyes searched the dense undergrowth for a yellow gaze staring back at him ($_eijirou) . 
This was nothing like that . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) wasn t stalking him ($_eijirou) . It was worse . He ($_eijirou) d already captured him ($_eijirou) , his ($_eijirou) warm palm pinning Eijirou ($_eijirou) to the ground as he ($_eijirou) hooked the other s legs over his ($_eijirou) and settled between his ($_eijirou) thighs . His ($_eijirou) eyes were mesmerizing - the deep crimson red of blood - and Eijirou couldn t move , like Bakugou ($_bakugou) s teeth were already resting on his ($_eijirou) throat . 
The_barbarian ($_eijirou) drew closer and Eijirou ($_eijirou) s breath stuttered , his ($_eijirou) stomach twitching as Bakugou ($_bakugou) slipped a hand up his ($_eijirou) soaked shirt . 
Then he ($_eijirou) ripped it off . 
He ($_eijirou) did it without any warning and Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped , flinching . What are you doing ?! 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) did n't answer . His ($_bakugou) touches were feather-light now , brushing along Eijirou ($_eijirou) s bandages . They were bloody and in disrepair , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) unwound them gently , tossing them to the side and winding fresh ones in their place . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) watched him ($_bakugou) work , mesmerized , then blinked when he ($_bakugou) reached into his ($_bakugou) pants pocket and pulled out something new - a ball the color of fresh pollen , vaguely reminiscent of a medicine ball although he ($_bakugou) d never seen one that color . 
He ($_bakugou) watched , fascinated , as Bakugou ($_bakugou) brought the ball to his ($_bakugou) lips and gnawed off almost a quarter of it with his ($_bakugou) teeth , holding the sliver in his ($_bakugou) mouth . 
Then he ($_bakugou) leaned in . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) panicked . Wait , wait , wait , what are you doing ?! he ($_bakugou) yelped again , twisting and writhing under Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand . But the_barbarian ($_eijirou) had him ($_bakugou) pinned - hands on his ($_bakugou) arms , his ($_bakugou) entire front pressing against him ($_bakugou) as he ($_bakugou) leaned forward to hold Eijirou ($_eijirou) down - and a noise escaped Eijirou ($_eijirou) s throat as he ($_bakugou) felt his ($_bakugou) ass slide against Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hips . 
This close that musk was enveloping him ($_bakugou) , making him ($_bakugou) even more flustered , and he ($_bakugou) turned his ($_bakugou) mouth away , taking great gulping lungfuls of air and kicking his ($_bakugou) legs . But none of it had any effect . Bakugou ($_bakugou) only pressed down harder , his ($_bakugou) lower belly pushing against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s groin and his ($_bakugou) dick grinding against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s ass with the movement . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) froze . 
If he ($_bakugou) continued to squirm he ($_bakugou) d only drive his ($_bakugou) ass further into Bakugou ($_bakugou) s lap . But if he ($_bakugou) didn t ... well , he ($_bakugou) refused to think about that . Or how much his ($_bakugou) body seemed to like the thought . 
He ($_bakugou) winced as Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed a handful of his ($_bakugou) hair and used it to turn him ($_bakugou) so that they were facing each other again . They were so close that their noses were touching , breath fanning over each other s faces as the medicine ball pressed right up against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s lips . 
Nn , the_barbarian ($_eijirou) grunted . 
Eijirou grit his ($_bakugou) teeth . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s brow furrowed and he ($_bakugou) leaned impossibly closer , his ($_bakugou) gaze falling to Eijirou s mouth as he ($_bakugou) tried to nudge the medicine past his ($_bakugou) lips , but Eijirou ($_eijirou) didn t budge . His ($_bakugou) face was on fire - they were practically kissing now - but he ($_bakugou) wouldn t lose this battle . 
Then Bakugou ($_bakugou) yanked his ($_bakugou) hair . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped , a shiver running the length of his ($_eijirou) spine and arching his ($_eijirou) back , forcing his ($_eijirou) nipples against Bakugou ($_bakugou) s chest . His ($_eijirou) mouth fell open and Bakugou ($_bakugou) pounced , pushing the medicine past his ($_eijirou) teeth and into his ($_eijirou) mouth then forcing it deeper with his ($_eijirou) tongue . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) squawked , eyes wide as they could go . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s lips were moving against his ($_bakugou) , sealing their mouths together , his ($_bakugou) tongue working his ($_bakugou) way deeper and deeper into Eijirou s mouth and pushing the medicine along with it . It was unbearably bitter and Eijirou ($_eijirou) struggled , trying to turn away so he ($_eijirou) could spit the taste out of his ($_eijirou) mouth . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) saw it coming and only held him ($_eijirou) tighter , pushing past Eijirou ($_eijirou) s tongue until the medicine was in the back of his ($_eijirou) throat . 
The urge to swallow was almost overpowering and Eijirou ($_eijirou) fought it as long as he ($_eijirou) could - after all , anything that tasted this bad couldn t possibly be safe . But Bakugou ($_bakugou) just waited him ($_eijirou) out , kissing him ($_eijirou) to keep his ($_eijirou) mouth occupied as he ($_eijirou) stroked the long column of his ($_eijirou) throat over and over and over and over . 
It was irresistible and after a few seconds Eijirou ($_eijirou) couldn t do anything but swallow , the medicine falling like a stone into his ($_eijirou) stomach . He ($_eijirou) mentally grimaced . It was done . If it did turn out to be poisonous and he ($_eijirou) ended up dying , he ($_eijirou) was totally coming back to haunt Bakugou ($_bakugou) for the rest of his ($_eijirou) life . 
He ($_eijirou) expected the barbarian to back off then , satisfied once he ($_eijirou) d felt Eijirou ($_eijirou) s Adam s apple bob , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) only pressed closer , licking into Eijirou ($_eijirou) s mouth . 
For a moment Eijirou ($_eijirou) wanted to fight just to spite him ($_eijirou) . But as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s tongue caressed his ($_bakugou) mouth , the bitter taste of the medicine faded to something smoother , mixing in the hot and wet of their mouths . It was strange but not unpleasant - definitely better than the medicine s aftertaste - and Eijirou ($_eijirou) slowly relaxed into it , losing himself ($_eijirou) in the rhythm of their lips . 
He ($_eijirou) groaned as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s tongue flicked against his ($_eijirou) palate , tickling it and sending shivers down his ($_eijirou) spine , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) inhaled sharp and harsh , turning his ($_eijirou) head so he ($_eijirou) could kiss even deeper . His ($_eijirou) hands shifted from pinning him ($_eijirou) to just feeling him ($_eijirou) , one moving up to cup Eijirou s neck while the other slid up his ($_eijirou) naked back . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) hummed , something low and resonant that vibrated against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s chest , buzzing against his ($_bakugou) nipples and making him ($_bakugou) arch even harder . Their dicks slid together as he ($_bakugou) moved and they groaned in unison this time , Eijirou winding his ($_bakugou) arms around Bakugou ($_bakugou) s neck to pull him ($_bakugou) closer . 
He ($_bakugou) wondered what they must look like , twined around each other and making out on a cave floor . The image made his ($_bakugou) dick twitch , already hard and getting harder . He ($_bakugou) could feel an answering hardness in Bakugou ($_bakugou) s pants , could feel the heat through the cloth , and his ($_bakugou) heart sped up , his ($_bakugou) legs tightening around Bakugou ($_bakugou) s waist . 
He ($_bakugou) d never gone this far with a guy before - with anyone period . There had never been anyone in his ($_bakugou) hometown that he ($_bakugou) had wanted and after he ($_bakugou) joined Midoriya s gang he ($_bakugou) never seemed to have time . He ($_bakugou) had seen women look at him ($_bakugou) sometimes , in the inns they frequented or on the roads whenever they traveled . But nothing like the way Bakugou was looking at him ($_bakugou) now , traveling up and down his ($_bakugou) body and cataloging every detail of the way their hips winded together . His ($_bakugou) stare was so intense . There was heat in those eyes , so much that Eijirou ($_eijirou) though he ($_bakugou) might burst into flames if he ($_bakugou) looked into them for too long . 
It was a look that laid him ($_bakugou) bare . 
The hand groping his ($_bakugou) back was roaming now , feeling along his ($_bakugou) sensitive sides , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) broke the kiss so he ($_bakugou) could hide his ($_bakugou) face in Bakugou ($_bakugou) s neck , mouthing at it . His ($_bakugou) scent was strong there , the musk that never failed to make his ($_bakugou) head spin , but instead of fighting it he ($_bakugou) took deep breaths , filling his ($_bakugou) lungs to bursting . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled , both hands sliding down to cup his ($_bakugou) ass , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) moaned as he ($_bakugou) squeezed him ($_bakugou) hard . He ($_bakugou) thought about the morning they d shared together , the overwhelming urge to bare his ($_bakugou) neck that he ($_bakugou) had tried so hard to fight . 
If it was now he ($_bakugou) might be able to do it . If it was now - 
Suddenly Bakugou ($_bakugou) pulled back , cocking his ($_bakugou) head to the side . Eijirou ($_eijirou) blinked , thrown off by the rush of cold air against him ($_bakugou) , then propped himself ($_bakugou) up on his ($_bakugou) elbows , the daze clearing from his ($_bakugou) mind . 
What is it ? he ($_bakugou) asked . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s body was tense , every muscle coiled like was on high alert . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) only pressed a hand over his ($_bakugou) mouth . Eijirou ($_eijirou) followed his ($_eijirou) lead and stayed silent , straining his ($_eijirou) ears to hear whatever it was that had him ($_eijirou) so on edge . There was the constant drone of cicadas , the rustle of leaves in the wind - nothing out of the ordinary . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) jumped up , darting to the cave entrance . 
Trespassers , he ($_bakugou) growled as he ($_bakugou) leaned out , extending his ($_bakugou) hand . In his ($_bakugou) palm , a litany of small explosions went off , so close together that it sounded like one fluid sound . Eijirou ($_eijirou) got up to join him ($_bakugou) , shooting him ($_bakugou) a questioning glance , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) kept his ($_bakugou) eyes peeled , watching the terrain . 
They waited for a moment ... two ... then a roar and the flap of wings sounded in the distance . A huge red figure leaped from where it had been hiding in the tree canopy , its wings unfurling as the_dragon ($_the) flew towards them and latched onto the cliff beside their cave . Bakugou ($_bakugou) wasted no time , his ($_bakugou) muscles bunching as he ($_bakugou) prepared to swing out onto the_dragon ($_the) s back , but before he ($_bakugou) could move Eijirou ($_eijirou) grabbed him ($_bakugou) . 
I m coming too ! He ($_bakugou) d had enough of waiting . If Bakugou ($_bakugou) was going to see some action , he ($_bakugou) wanted in on it . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) gave him ($_bakugou) a flat look and Eijirou ($_eijirou) knew he ($_bakugou) must be thinking back to his ($_bakugou) unsupervised excursion and run in with the black dragon . But he ($_bakugou) refused to back down . 
If you re flying out into trouble then I m going to cover your back , he ($_bakugou) said , hardening his ($_bakugou) fists and smashing them together for emphasis . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked at him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) didn t say anything and Eijirou ($_eijirou) didn t either , just held his ($_bakugou) gaze as he ($_bakugou) let him ($_bakugou) take in his ($_bakugou) fill . 
Then Bakugou ($_bakugou) grinned , a slow one equal parts savage and breathtaking . It was a look that spelled imminent defeat for any enemy that stood in their way . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) grinned back , his ($_eijirou) razor sharp teeth glinting in the sunlight . 
---
This high up everything looked like toys . Eijirou ($_eijirou) marveled from his ($_eijirou) spot against Bakugou ($_bakugou) s chest , head whipping around to take in as much as he ($_eijirou) could . From this vantage point , he ($_eijirou) could see all of Academia laid out like a map , everything from the mountains in the west to the villages out east . As they flew over the mountains he ($_eijirou) could even make out the haze of ocean in the south , just a thin line of blue on the horizon . 
This is so awesome ! he ($_eijirou) yelled over the wind and even though Bakugou ($_bakugou) s body was a line of tension against his ($_eijirou) back , he ($_eijirou) smiled , his ($_eijirou) lips brushing_Eijirou ($_eijirou) s neck . 
He ($_eijirou) didn t say anything though , eyes fixated on their destination , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) turned to see where he ($_eijirou) was looking . Just ahead of them there was a break in the forest canopy - a snake of a trail that wound from the nearest village back to the mountains of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s home . Eijirou ($_eijirou) squinted . Near the base of the mountain range , there was something on the trail but he ($_eijirou) couldn t tell what - from this distance , it was just a slowly moving smudge on the terrain . But as they drew nearer , the blur began to form into distinct shapes and Eijirou ($_eijirou) realized that it was a band of travelers . Must be the trespassers . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) saw them too and he ($_bakugou) leaned over Eijirou ($_eijirou) to pat the_dragon ($_the) s neck , his ($_bakugou) other arm curling around Eijirou ($_eijirou) s waist . Eijirou ($_eijirou) swallowed , buzzing with nervous energy . He ($_eijirou) d been through this before . He ($_eijirou) braced himself ($_eijirou) , leaning over as Bakugou ($_bakugou) pushed them both down against the beast s scaly neck , and a second later the_dragon ($_the) dove , plummeting to the ground at breakneck speed . 
It was terrifying and exciting at the same time . If this was what it felt like everytime then Eijirou ($_eijirou) could see why Bakugou ($_bakugou) had become a dragon rider . 
The band of travelers barely had time to see them coming . Eijirou ($_eijirou) could hear them gasp and cry out as the_dragon ($_the) landed hard , blowing a plume of dirt up into the air where it ($_the) lingered with no breeze to drift it ($_the) away . It ($_the) was the perfect camouflage . 
Immediately Bakugou ($_bakugou) was on the ground , Eijirou ($_eijirou) following suit . The barbarian was fast and quiet , keeping low to the ground as he got some distance between him and the_dragon ($_the) . Even with the low visibility , the beast was easy to spot , its huge figure and glowing eyes making it a dead giveaway . But the yelling that its sudden appearance caused meant Bakugou and Eijirou ($_eijirou) went almost unnoticed , skirting around the group to flank them . 
While the_dragon ($_the) distracted them , the two got into position . Then Bakugou ($_bakugou) attacked . 
He sprinted into the fray like a shadow , using an explosion to launch himself at the nearest person and slam them into the ground . The travelers whirled at the noise , trying to find the source and deal with the dragon at the same time , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t hesitate at all , exploding around the field to keep them off balance even as he targeted those farthest from the heart of the group . 
Watching him , Eijirou ($_eijirou) couldn t help but wonder how many times he d done this before . Then he shook his head and jumped into the fray himself , immediately hardening his body and sweeping two of the travelers legs . They fell to the ground and Eijirou ($_eijirou) rolled , winding back to give both of them a punch to the solar plexus , when a familiar voice stopped him . 
What the hell , one of the travelers groaned , holding his head where it had hit the ground . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) blinked . Kaminari ($_kaminari) ? 
The figure jumped and sat up . 
Kirishima ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) asked , disbelief clear in his ($_kaminari) voice . What the hell man , we were looking for you ! 
Then a dragon roar cut him ($_kaminari) off and Eijirou ($_eijirou) turned just in time to see a huge jet of flame shoot out of the beast s mouth . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) ! someone yelled and Eijirou ($_eijirou) recognized Midoriya s voice just as a giant wall of ice leaped up to block the fire . But in that exact moment , in the flash of light and heat , Eijirou ($_eijirou) could see Bakugou ($_bakugou) explode through the air and drag Todoroki ($_todoroki) right off his ($_bakugou) white horse . 
Damn , Kaminari said . He ($_bakugou) d seen the same thing and was about to run to Todoroki s aid but Eijirou ($_eijirou) pulled him ($_bakugou) back , sprinting there himself ($_bakugou) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) , stop ! he ($_bakugou) yelled . Todoroki ($_todoroki) had recovered and was rounding on the barbarian , his ($_bakugou) sword already mid-swing even as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s palm lit up with an explosion , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) saw the whole thing happen in slow motion , his ($_bakugou) heart clenching , right before he ($_bakugou) barreled into Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) s explosion went wide , a huge bang that made Eijirou ($_eijirou) s bones rattle and his ($_bakugou) eyes squeeze shut just as Todoroki ($_todoroki) s sword came down on his ($_bakugou) back . All three of them went flying , slamming into the ground and rolling with the momentum . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) groaned , ears ringing . When his ($_bakugou) eyes finally blinked open everything was a shaky blur . He ($_bakugou) struggled to sit up but he ($_bakugou) was dizzy , a line of pain smarting on his ($_bakugou) back . Dimly he ($_bakugou) was aware of figures running towards him ($_bakugou) but he ($_bakugou) paid them no mind . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Where were Bakugou and Todoroki ($_todoroki) ? 
Kaminari ($_kaminari) reached him ($_bakugou) just as he ($_bakugou) spotted Bakugou ($_bakugou) . The barbarian was struggling to his feet , his rage almost tangible . It wasn t directed at Eijirou ($_eijirou) though and Eijirou ($_eijirou) followed his ($_eijirou) gaze to where Todoroki ($_todoroki) was getting up , the sword he ($_eijirou) d broken on Eijirou ($_eijirou) s hardened back hanging uselessly in his ($_eijirou) hand . 
Are you okay , dude ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) asked but he ($_eijirou) didn t answer . Todoroki ($_todoroki) was preparing to use his ($_eijirou) quirk and across the field , Bakugou ($_bakugou) tensed . They were about to attack each other again . 
He ($_eijirou) scrambled to his ($_eijirou) feet , ignoring Kaminari ($_kaminari) s worried shout and sprinting to Bakugou just as Todoroki ($_todoroki) unleashed a wall of ice . 
He ($_eijirou) wasn t going to make it . 
He ($_eijirou) gritted his ($_eijirou) teeth , pushing his ($_eijirou) legs harder , his ($_eijirou) lungs burning . He ($_eijirou) had to make it . He ($_eijirou) was going to stop this if it killed him ($_eijirou) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) already had his ($_bakugou) palm up , ready to blast straight through Todoroki ($_todoroki) s attack but Eijirou ($_eijirou) intercepted him ($_bakugou) just in time , slamming into the ice and shattering it . 
Stop! he ($_eijirou) screamed again . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) blinked , immediately cutting off his ($_eijirou) attack . Out of the corner of his ($_eijirou) eye , Eijirou ($_eijirou) saw Bakugou ($_bakugou) bristle and he ($_eijirou) turned back to look at him ($_eijirou) , holding his ($_eijirou) gaze . 
I know these guys , he ($_eijirou) said as seriously as he ($_eijirou) could . They re my friends . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) glared , his ($_bakugou) eyes darting to the rest of the travelers , and honestly , Eijirou ($_eijirou) had no way of knowing whether or not the barbarian even understood him ($_bakugou) . But he ($_bakugou) didn t spare his ($_bakugou) friends a glance , giving Bakugou ($_bakugou) his ($_bakugou) full attention . He ($_bakugou) hadn t spent that much time around animals but he ($_bakugou) had enough sense to know that in a pack you never addressed anyone before your leader . 
They stayed like that for a moment , silence descending on the group as Bakugou ($_bakugou) scrutinized them all . Even the dragon sensed it , still on high alert but waiting for the command to attack . 
But finally , Bakugou ($_bakugou) locked eyes with Eijirou ($_eijirou) . He ($_bakugou) was pissed , Eijirou ($_eijirou) could tell . There was still tension in the air and he ($_bakugou) knew it chafed Bakugou ($_bakugou) to end the fight there with no clear winners or losers . But he ($_bakugou) still tilted his ($_bakugou) head over so slightly , shifting into a more neutral fighting stance as he ($_bakugou) signaled his ($_bakugou) dragon to stand down . 
Anyone else would have missed it but Eijirou ($_eijirou) recognized it as the sign it was . He ($_bakugou) breathed a sigh of relief , turning to smile at the rest of the group , and just like that the spell was broken . 
Kirishima ($_kirishima) ? a voice ventured and he ($_bakugou) turned to see Midoriya approaching him ($_bakugou) hesitantly , wary of the barbarian still in their midst . Around him ($_bakugou) , the others were fidgeting , alternating between staring at Kirishima ($_kirishima) and sneaking glances at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . What...? How...? 
Hey guys , Eijirou ($_eijirou) said , a sheepish grin spreading across his ($_eijirou) face . Long time no see . 
---
Getting his ($_eijirou) group to accept Bakugou ($_bakugou) was , surprisingly , not all that difficult . After he ($_eijirou) d recounted everything he ($_eijirou) could remember since they d lost each other - tactfully skipping over some unnecessary details , of course - they accepted him ($_eijirou) immediately if cautiously . They 'd all dealt with worse after all and sometimes it was best just to roll with the punches and count your blessings . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was a different story . 
We re on a quest to fight evil , Eijirou ($_eijirou) said as cheerfully as he ($_eijirou) could . He ($_eijirou) d followed Bakugou ($_bakugou) into the underbrush off the side of the trail since apparently the guy was allergic to being around a group for too long , and now they were standing by the side of a stream , Bakugou ($_bakugou) cooling his ($_bakugou) hands in the water . Specifically Shigaraki ($_shigaraki) s dark army . You should join us ! 
Bakugou didn t answer , didn t even look up . He ($_eijirou) just clicked his ($_eijirou) tongue . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) tried again . You re a great fighter ! We could use your help . 
This time Bakugou ($_bakugou) did look up . But it was just to make a face at him ($_eijirou) and at this point , Eijirou ($_eijirou) was seriously starting to wonder exactly how much of his ($_eijirou) language Bakugou understood . The timing of his ($_eijirou) sneers was just a little too accurate to be a coincidence . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) stood up , flinging water from his ($_bakugou) hands as he ($_bakugou) stomped off , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) followed , racking his ($_bakugou) brain for something to convince him ($_bakugou) to stay . That mountain range , he ($_bakugou) blurted and Bakugou ($_bakugou) glanced back at him ($_bakugou) , you re protecting it from trespassers , right ? Or whatever s beyond it ? 
Bakugou didn t answer , turning away , but Eijirou ($_eijirou) soldiered on , determined to get through to him ($_bakugou) . 
What do you think will happen when Shigaraki ($_shigaraki) s forces get there ? You can t fight him ($_bakugou) on your own , you need - 
He ($_bakugou) didn t get to finish his ($_bakugou) sentence before Bakugou ($_bakugou) whirled on him ($_bakugou) . 
Shut up , I could take him ($_bakugou) , he ($_bakugou) hissed in perfect , accented English . You lookin down on me ? 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) gaped . 
You could understand me this whole time ? he ($_bakugou) yelled and Bakugou ($_bakugou) rolled his ($_bakugou) eyes , walking off again . Eijirou ($_eijirou) watched him ($_bakugou) go for a second , skin flushing as his ($_bakugou) memories of the past few days realigned to fit this new knowledge . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) was still avoiding the issue so he ($_bakugou) cleared his ($_bakugou) throat . Why d you save me then ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) gave him ($_bakugou) a sharp look over his ($_bakugou) shoulder and Eijirou ($_eijirou) barreled on . You could have left me buried under that house but you didn t . Why? 
Bakugou didn t answer and Eijirou ($_eijirou) nodded , his ($_bakugou) lips quirking up . 
It s because you re a good guy , Bakugou ($_bakugou) . I know it . And I know you wouldn t let Shigaraki ($_shigaraki) - 
Bandits , Bakugou ($_bakugou) cut in and Eijirou ($_eijirou) blinked , his ($_eijirou) smile faltering . 
What? he ($_eijirou) asked and Bakugou ($_bakugou) scowled . 
I found you in that town because the bandits that trashed it took something from me , he ($_eijirou) growled . They and your shitty group were long gone by the time I got there so I figured I d get some information out of you . He ($_eijirou) clicked his ($_eijirou) tongue , turning away . Don t go reading into it . 
He ($_eijirou) stomped off again and Eijirou ($_eijirou) stared after him ($_eijirou) blankly . Logically , he ($_eijirou) knew it shouldn t matter - Bakugou had still spent days tending to him ($_eijirou) , had still rescued him ($_eijirou) from both a collapsed house and a feral dragon - but that didn t stop the stinging in his ($_eijirou) chest . 
Oh , he ($_eijirou) rasped past the tightness in his ($_eijirou) throat . He ($_eijirou) wasn t sure what he ($_eijirou) d been expecting . Well , we can look for them too . The more people searching , the better right ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped , looking back at him ($_eijirou) , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) offered a weak smile . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s brow furrowed but he ($_bakugou) didn t comment on it . 
We re looking for the bandits first , he ($_bakugou) said instead . Then he ($_bakugou) whipped around to beat a path back to the trail . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) nodded . Sure , man . Whatever you say . 
He ($_bakugou) followed after him ($_bakugou) , making his ($_bakugou) much slower way back to the clearing and when he ($_bakugou) finally emerged the group was waiting for him ($_bakugou) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) just far away enough from the rest of them to emphasize his ($_bakugou) dissatisfaction as he ($_bakugou) tended to his ($_bakugou) dragon . 
There you are . We were just about to send a search party , Kaminari ($_kaminari) joked . Eijirou ($_eijirou) gave him ($_bakugou) a half-hearted smile . 
I m ready to find some bandits , he ($_bakugou) said and the group all nodded at him ($_bakugou) , Kaminari ($_kaminari) propping an arm on his ($_bakugou) shoulder and giving him ($_bakugou) a thumbs up . 
Alright , he ($_bakugou) said , I ($_bakugou) ve been dying to show off my ($_bakugou) new moves on someone . Let s do this ! 
But even though Kaminari ($_kaminari) s attitude was infectious , Eijirou ($_eijirou) couldn t stop thinking about what Bakugou ($_bakugou) had told him ($_bakugou) . It was stupid to be wallowing this much over something so trivial , and he ($_bakugou) tried to push it from his ($_bakugou) mind and act like normal , but he ($_bakugou) knew the others were picking up on it by the way they slowed to walk with him ($_bakugou) or made sure to sit next to him ($_bakugou) on breaks . 
All of them but the one he ($_bakugou) wanted most , of course . 
But that wasn t his ($_bakugou) group s fault - they were trying their best and he ($_bakugou) appreciated the thought at least . So when Satou offered him ($_bakugou) food , he ($_bakugou) accepted even though everything he ($_bakugou) ate tasted like sand . And when Mina bumped hips with him ($_bakugou) in the middle of a victory dance , he ($_bakugou) smiled and bumped right back even though his ($_bakugou) feet felt like lead . And he ($_bakugou) studiously avoided looking at Bakugou ($_bakugou) because he ($_bakugou) could endure a lot but that didn t make him ($_bakugou) a masochist . 
By the time they broke for camp , he ($_bakugou) was exhausted . 
What s up with you ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) asked while they set up lean-tos on the periphery of the campfire . Or at least , while Eijirou ($_eijirou) set up lean-tos . Kaminari ($_kaminari) was reclining on the fallen tree next to him ($_bakugou) , propped up on an elbow and chewing some jerky while he ($_bakugou) watched Eijirou ($_eijirou) work . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) sighed . Bakugou ($_bakugou) had left them hours ago - presumably to set up his ($_bakugou) own camp further away - and he ($_bakugou) figured now was as good a time as any . He ($_bakugou) set down his ($_bakugou) things and sat on the tree too . 
I like Bakugou ($_bakugou) , he ($_bakugou) murmured , kicking at the leaves scattered around them . 
Kaminari ($_kaminari) gaped at him ($_bakugou) . Then he ($_bakugou) sat up and scooted closer so he ($_bakugou) could sling an arm over his ($_bakugou) shoulder . 
I m so sorry , he ($_bakugou) said , solemn-like_Eijirou ($_eijirou) had just told him ($_bakugou) he ($_bakugou) had to amputate his ($_bakugou) own arm , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) elbowed him ($_bakugou) . Okay, okay. But seriously , why him ($_bakugou) ? There was nothing going on while you were in that cave with him ($_bakugou) , was there ? 
He ($_bakugou) waggled his ($_bakugou) eyebrows at that and Eijirou ($_eijirou) flushed a spectacular shade of red . 
No ! he ($_bakugou) blurted too quick and Kaminari ($_kaminari) crowed . 
Seriously?! he ($_bakugou) asked , rocking back on his ($_bakugou) ass . He ($_bakugou) looked like he ($_bakugou) d just bitten into the juiciest news he ($_bakugou) d heard all week and suddenly Eijirou ($_eijirou) regretted everything . What happened? Did he ($_bakugou) attack you in the night or something ? Did he ($_bakugou) wall slam you ? He ($_bakugou) looks like the type to wall slam . 
He ($_bakugou) was going a mile a minute now and Eijirou ($_eijirou) buried his ($_bakugou) face in his ($_bakugou) hands . Kaminari ($_kaminari) was insatiable when he ($_bakugou) got like this and if Eijirou ($_eijirou) had known what a Pandora s box this was going to be , he ($_bakugou) never would have opened it . Now he ($_bakugou) was going to have to deal with Kaminari ($_kaminari) ribbing him ($_bakugou) about this for weeks . 
He ($_bakugou) leaned back as Kaminari ($_kaminari) crowded him ($_bakugou) , resigning himself ($_bakugou) to the barrage of questions . Then , in the middle of it , Kaminari ($_kaminari) abruptly cut off with a yelp and a thump . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) peaked around his ($_eijirou) fingers . Kaminari ($_kaminari) was on the ground , staring wide-eyed at Bakugou looming over them . 
What the hell was that for ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) asked , bewildered , and it took Eijirou ($_eijirou) a minute to realize that Bakugou ($_bakugou) had shoved him ($_eijirou) . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) glared . Leave , he ($_bakugou) growled and Eijirou ($_eijirou) swallowed . He ($_bakugou) sounded angry - more so than usual . 
Kaminari ($_kaminari) blinked at him ($_bakugou) for a moment , mouth hanging open , and then chanced a glance at Eijirou ($_eijirou) . But if Bakugou ($_bakugou) was doing this then he ($_bakugou) must have something he ($_bakugou) wanted to talk about , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) was past due to get some things off his ($_bakugou) chest himself ($_bakugou) . So he ($_bakugou) nodded at Kaminari ($_kaminari) , averting his ($_bakugou) eyes when Kaminari ($_kaminari) shrugged and got to his ($_bakugou) feet . 
Alright , alright , I m going , Kaminari ($_kaminari) said , giving Bakugou ($_bakugou) a lazy salute . Then he ($_kaminari) was walking off towards where the rest of the group was still setting up camp and it was just the two of them alone . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) was staring at him ($_kaminari) . Eijirou ($_eijirou) glanced up at him ($_kaminari) and away again , clearing his ($_kaminari) throat . Why did you do that ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) clicked his ($_bakugou) tongue , slamming down next to him ($_bakugou) on the tree . The fuck are you letting him ($_bakugou) crawl all over you for ? he ($_bakugou) growled , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) didn t know what to say to that . Kaminari ($_kaminari) hadn t been acting any different than usual so he ($_bakugou) didn t really know what Bakugou ($_bakugou) was talking about . 
But apparently , he ($_bakugou) took too long to answer because Bakugou ($_bakugou) scowled . 
Did you like it or some shit ? he ($_bakugou) asked , getting up in Eijirou ($_eijirou) s face . His ($_bakugou) breath fanned over Eijirou ($_eijirou) s skin as he ($_bakugou) did and Eijirou ($_eijirou) could smell that faint scent of musk again , the one that drove him ($_bakugou) so wild . In that moment he ($_bakugou) wanted to lean in and close the distance between them , everything be damned . His ($_bakugou) eyes even flickered down to trace the seam of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s lips , bared to reveal the glint of teeth . 
But he ($_bakugou) resisted , pulling his ($_bakugou) eyes up to meet Bakugou ($_bakugou) s. 
Why should you care ? he ($_bakugou) asked . You just wanted me so you could find out about the bandits , right ? Well , you found out about them . It hurt to say out loud but it was true . Bakugou ($_bakugou) had said it himself ($_bakugou) . 
He ($_bakugou) made to stand up , trying to leave before he ($_bakugou) bared anymore of himself ($_bakugou) , but jerked to a stop as a hand snagged his ($_bakugou) arm . He ($_bakugou) turned to see Bakugou ($_bakugou) frowning at him ($_bakugou) , standing up so he ($_bakugou) could push into Eijirou ($_eijirou) s space and back him ($_bakugou) up against the lean-to . 
I never said I was done with you , he ($_bakugou) said , and his ($_bakugou) voice was like gravel , rolling rough against Eijirou s body and bringing goosebumps to his ($_bakugou) skin . He ($_bakugou) pressed closer , caging Eijirou ($_eijirou) in between his ($_bakugou) legs , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) sent a prayer of thanks to the gods for the lean-to that hid them from sight because Bakugou ($_bakugou) was entirely too close . 
It made it hard to think and he ($_bakugou) licked his ($_bakugou) lips . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes followed the motion . 
I already said I d help you find the bandits , Eijirou ($_eijirou) said , careful not to misunderstand anything . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) just rolled his ($_bakugou) eyes . Gods , you re an idiot . 
Then he ($_bakugou) leaned forward and smashed their mouths together . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped , sharp and harsh against Bakugou ($_bakugou) s skin as Bakugou ($_bakugou) kissed him ($_bakugou) , working a hand up Eijirou ($_eijirou) s back and into his ($_bakugou) hair so he ($_bakugou) could pull at it . He ($_bakugou) was seeing stars . After what had happened , he ($_bakugou) hadn t dared to hope for this again - he ($_bakugou) was sure Bakugou wouldn t want it and , worse yet , would look down on him ($_bakugou) for wanting it himself ($_bakugou) . 
But obviously he ($_bakugou) was wrong , and he ($_bakugou) surged up , arching against Bakugou s chest as he ($_bakugou) licked into his ($_bakugou) mouth . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) hummed against him ($_bakugou) and his ($_bakugou) hands groped down to grip Eijirou s ass , squeezing and pulling until Eijirou ($_eijirou) whimpered . Get these fucking pants off . 
He ($_bakugou) slurred it against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s lips , nipping at his ($_bakugou) tongue , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) froze , pulling back from the kiss to glance over in the direction of the rest of the group . He ($_bakugou) d almost forgotten they were there - there was no telling how much they d heard already . 
We can t - he ($_bakugou) started , moving to step back so he ($_bakugou) wasn t pressed against the tempting planes of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s abs , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) snarled , shoving a thigh in between Eijirou ($_eijirou) s legs . Eijirou ($_eijirou) yelped , jumping at the sudden warm friction against his ($_eijirou) cock , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed his ($_eijirou) face , squeezing his ($_eijirou) cheeks together as he ($_eijirou) forced Eijirou ($_eijirou) to turn towards him ($_eijirou) . 
Quit thinking about them . You re . With. Me . he ($_eijirou) growled , inches away from Eijirou ($_eijirou) s lips . 
He ($_eijirou) shoved his ($_eijirou) thigh harder against him ($_eijirou) and Eijirou ($_eijirou) whimpered , his ($_eijirou) legs shaking a little as they spread wider . But they re right there , he ($_eijirou) whispered , his ($_eijirou) voice high and strained from the pressure on his ($_eijirou) balls . He ($_eijirou) clutched at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s back , littering scratch marks all over it , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) hissed , a dangerous smile quirking his ($_bakugou) lips . 
Like I give a fuck , he ($_bakugou) said , leaning forward so he ($_bakugou) could growl into Eijirou s ear . Now moan for it . 
He ($_bakugou) pulled Eijirou ($_eijirou) s pants down himself ($_bakugou) , ripping them in the process , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) tried to remember how to breathe . 
Lube ... we don t. . . have any , he ($_bakugou) managed between pants . Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked at him ($_bakugou) , licking his ($_bakugou) palm then wrapping his ($_bakugou) warm , calloused hand around Eijirou ($_eijirou) s dick . 
You d better get wet then , he ($_bakugou) said . 
Then Eijirou ($_eijirou) was surging up onto his ($_eijirou) toes , a hand clasping over his ($_eijirou) own mouth to hold back the moans from Bakugou working his ($_eijirou) dick , fast and hard right from the start . He ($_eijirou) set a punishing pace , stripping his ($_eijirou) dick like he ($_eijirou) wanted to pull the cum straight from his ($_eijirou) balls , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) tensed , blood rushing south so fast it made him ($_eijirou) dizzy . 
Not so fast , he ($_eijirou) said , voice breaking around a moan , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) hardly paid him ($_eijirou) any attention , his ($_eijirou) free hand sliding over his ($_eijirou) hip to rub hard and insistent at Eijirou ($_eijirou) s hole . It twitched , parting a little at the press of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s finger , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) gasped . Wait , I ve never - Gone in dry before , he ($_eijirou) wanted to say . He ($_eijirou) d played with his ($_eijirou) ass before , fucked himself ($_eijirou) sloppy until he ($_eijirou) came on four fingers in fact , but he ($_eijirou) d never done this . 
But Bakugou ($_bakugou) s finger was already pressing inside and Eijirou ($_eijirou) hissed , eyes rolling up into his ($_eijirou) head as his ($_eijirou) rim fluttered around it . It hurt but felt so good at the same time , especially when Bakugou ($_bakugou) angled it just right until he ($_eijirou) was fucking down into Eijirou s prostate with every stroke . Combined with the hand fisting his ($_eijirou) dick , Eijirou ($_eijirou) didn t stand a chance . 
He ($_eijirou) came , a strangled moan escaping his ($_eijirou) throat as he ($_eijirou) fucked back onto the finger drilling inside of him ($_eijirou) . He ($_eijirou) was still straddling Bakugou ($_bakugou) s leg and he ($_eijirou) moaned , grinding his ($_eijirou) balls and taint on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s thigh like a slut , but it felt too good to stop . 
When he ($_eijirou) opened his ($_eijirou) eyes , Bakugou ($_bakugou) was licking his ($_bakugou) lips and staring at him ($_bakugou) like he ($_bakugou) was a four-course meal . 
You got your fucking spunk all over my hand , he ($_eijirou) said , low , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) looked down to see it dripping thick and sticky between Bakugou ($_bakugou) s fingers . It was a lot and Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked at him ($_eijirou) , dark and promising . 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) blushed . 
S-sorry , he ($_eijirou) tried , brain still struggling to come back online . But Bakugou ($_bakugou) just spun him ($_eijirou) around , shoving him ($_eijirou) against the lean-to and kicking his ($_eijirou) legs apart so he ($_eijirou) could slot against him ($_eijirou) . His ($_eijirou) cock slid against his ($_eijirou) thigh , throbbing with the need to be inside him ($_eijirou) , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) whimpered . 
Don ($_don) t you ($_don) ever play with yourself ($_don) ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) mocked , wiping his ($_bakugou) hand off between Eijirou ($_eijirou) s cheeks and slicking it with cum . It was still warm and Bakugou ($_bakugou) grinned against his ($_bakugou) neck , biting down as he ($_bakugou) worked two fingers inside , squelching with every thrust . 
Yeah , Eijirou ($_eijirou) breathed , defensive , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) grunted at him ($_bakugou) to continue . But it was hard with the way he ($_bakugou) was scraping over his ($_bakugou) prostate , over-sensitive and swollen from coming once already . It s just been a while . His ($_bakugou) dick was swinging between his ($_bakugou) legs , half hard and throbbing , and he ($_bakugou) wanted to touch himself ($_bakugou) so bad but he ($_bakugou) was drowning in sensations already , pleasure so intense it bordered on pain spiking up his ($_bakugou) back . 
He ($_bakugou) bit his ($_bakugou) lip , arching his ($_bakugou) neck until the back of his ($_bakugou) head was resting on Bakugou s shoulder . Bakugou ($_bakugou) took it for the invitation it was , licking a flat stripe up the side of Eijirou ($_eijirou) s throat . 
I m not going easy on you , he ($_bakugou) growled against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s jugular . 
Then he ($_bakugou) pulled back , working his ($_bakugou) fingers out so he ($_bakugou) could press his ($_bakugou) cock inside . 
Oh fuck , Eijirou ($_eijirou) whimpered , thighs shaking . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was thick , much thicker than what he ($_bakugou) was prepared for , and he ($_bakugou) hung his ($_bakugou) head down , watching cum drool from his ($_bakugou) dick like Bakugou ($_bakugou) was pushing it out of him ($_bakugou) . 
That s right , Bakugou ($_bakugou) panted , fucking into him ($_bakugou) . Moan louder. I want them to hear you . He ($_bakugou) slammed deeper , balls slapping against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s taint , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) yelped , flushing a deep red immediately after . There was no way the rest of the group hadn t heard that , no way they couldn t hear his asscheeks slapping into the cradle of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hips with every thrust . 
It turned him on like nothing else . 
He clenched tighter around the cock pistoning into him and Bakugou ($_bakugou) gave a breathless laugh . 
You like that ? You like them knowing you re my little bitch ? he asked , curling over Eijirou s back so he could fuck more noises out of his throat . Eijirou ($_eijirou) hid his ($_eijirou) face in his ($_eijirou) arm but it was too late , Bakugou ($_bakugou) already knew and he ($_eijirou) wasn t letting go . You do , don t you ? You want me to fuck you in front of them ? In the dirt , face down ass up like a real bitch ? 
His ($_eijirou) hips got impossibly faster as he ($_eijirou) talked , enjoying this and , if Eijirou ($_eijirou) s hardening cock was anything to go by , so was he ($_eijirou) . 
So he ($_eijirou) swallowed down his ($_eijirou) pride and nodded . Yeah. 
You want them all to see who you belong to , Bakugou ($_bakugou) asked , leaning forward so his ($_bakugou) breath fanned over Eijirou ($_eijirou) s ear . Don ($_don) t you ? 
Eijirou ($_eijirou) swallowed . Yeah. 
And Bakugou ($_bakugou) smirked , grabbing Eijirou ($_eijirou) s chin and turning it to the side to where Kaminari ($_kaminari) was watching them , frozen with a canteen slipping out of his ($_kaminari) hands . Then smile , Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled , low and possessive . 
Then he ($_kaminari) slammed inside and Eijirou ($_eijirou) exploded , coming so hard that his ($_kaminari) legs gave out . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) held him ($_kaminari) up , fucking into him ($_kaminari) until he ($_kaminari) blew his ($_kaminari) load too , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) had just enough time to feel the cum slide out of his ($_kaminari) ass and down his ($_kaminari) shaking thighs before he ($_kaminari) collapsed , panting . He ($_kaminari) glanced up , looking for Kaminari ($_kaminari) but the_guy ($_kaminari) had already left , beating a wise and hasty retreat . Distantly he ($_kaminari) considered freaking out over it , but to be honest , his ($_kaminari) mind was still reeling from being fucked so brutally and all he ($_kaminari) could manage was a vague resignation . 
Behind him ($_kaminari) , Bakugou ($_bakugou) was sucking at his ($_bakugou) neck again , leaving a string of possessive hickies while he ($_bakugou) ground his ($_bakugou) hips softly against Eijirou ($_eijirou) s ass , and Eijirou ($_eijirou) knew he ($_bakugou) should be mad at him ($_kaminari) but he ($_bakugou) didn t have enough energy . So he ($_bakugou) focused on what he ($_bakugou) could deal with . 
So ... you re staying , then ? he ($_bakugou) asked , starting simple . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) scoffed , sending warm breath skittering over Eijirou ($_eijirou) s skin . Your stupid group wouldn t survive without me .
