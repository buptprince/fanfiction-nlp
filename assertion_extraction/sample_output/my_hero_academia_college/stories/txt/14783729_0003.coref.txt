They ended up talking a for a long time , until the stars had shifted in the sky and the very first signs of morning had started to show . Izuku ($_izuku) liked to talk a lot , he ($_izuku) often went on tangents and tended to ramble , but Shouto ($_shouto) found that he ($_izuku) didn t mind it at all . He ($_izuku) liked the ease of it , the way he ($_izuku) could sink into his ($_izuku) words and listen , like he ($_izuku) were soaking in a warm bath . Izuku ($_izuku) should be a stranger to him ($_izuku) , yet he ($_izuku) was oddly at ease . Not enough to say much , but he ($_izuku) didn t feel he ($_izuku) had to keep magic at his ($_izuku) fingertips for preemptive measures . 
Eventually , however , he ($_izuku) had to convince Izuku ($_izuku) to go back to his ($_izuku) quarters and sleep , with the promise that they d meet again soon . He ($_izuku) didn t want to go back into the castle either , but he ($_izuku) couldn t get caught out of his ($_izuku) room after daybreak . He ($_izuku) couldn t get caught out of his ($_izuku) room at night at all really . 
Hopefully I ll get to talk to you again . Izuku ($_izuku) said , fidgeting with his ($_izuku) hands . Then he ($_izuku) turned pink , Sorry , that might sound weird 
No , of course . Shouto ($_shouto) said , I d like to see you again too . 
At this Izuku just got more flustered , and he ($_izuku) started mumbling out a thanks , and a promise to make a plan , followed by the beginnings of a plan , followed by the logistics and pitfalls of a possible plan . 
Leave it to me . Shouto ($_shouto) gently cut Izuku ($_izuku) s rambling off , I ll see you soon . 
Okay. Izuku ($_izuku) gave him ($_izuku) a determined sort of smile , Goodnight . 
Shouto ($_shouto) unconsciously dipped his ($_shouto) head in a sort of bow , before turning back to walk to the castle . He ($_shouto) had to weave through a labyrinth of hedges , the sculpture garden , back to the cellar doors he ($_shouto) d used to sneak out . 
He ($_shouto) d remembered Izuku ($_izuku) , somehow , as a concept that never truly left him ($_izuku) . He ($_shouto) d grown up unable to play with other kids , he ($_shouto) always had something he ($_shouto) had to be doing , training , studying . His ($_shouto) only friend had been Momo , but she was always just as busy as he ($_shouto) was , as an apprentice . The time his ($_shouto) mother let him ($_shouto) escape had been one of the handful he ($_shouto) d been able to have , and he ($_shouto) always remembered the idea of someone who d once said he ($_shouto) was a friend . While he ($_shouto) didn t want to get ahead of himself ($_shouto) , Shouto ($_shouto) hoped this ($_shouto) was something he ($_shouto) could keep , an actual friend . 
Shouto ($_shouto) had to find a night that he ($_shouto) was free to escape his ($_shouto) lessons . Many nights he ($_shouto) was required to study ; as future king he ($_shouto) must be cultured and well read . He ($_shouto) d be confined to a heavy wooden desk and surrounded by thick leather bound books with yellowing parchment pages , each one more boring than the last . His ($_shouto) tutors made him ($_shouto) recite passages from memory and keep conversations about concepts so boring that Shouto ($_shouto) could feel himself ($_shouto) falling asleep as he ($_shouto) talked . He ($_shouto) much preferred the fictional stories from the castle s library , stories that let him ($_shouto) experience a freedom he ($_shouto) s long been denied . But a future king is not to distract himself ($_shouto) with fictional tales . 
Shouto didn t want to be the future king . 
By design he ($_shouto) was powerful , it was by his ($_shouto) father s intentions , but he ($_shouto) wasn t naturally gifted , he ($_shouto) d skills beaten into him ($_shouto) , in many senses . But that s never what he ($_shouto) wanted . He ($_shouto) wasn t even sure what he ($_shouto) could want . 
What he ($_shouto) liked was to wander the grounds , through the gardens , around the mossy pond shaded by the long draping branches of a weeping willow . He ($_shouto) d sit behind a curtain of lilac colored leaves , hiding from his ($_shouto) father , his ($_shouto) attendants , anyone who wanted to pull him ($_shouto) back to the training grounds , to the study , to the throne room . He ($_shouto) would make little sculptures out of ice . A favorite of his ($_shouto) had always been butterflies , with paper thin wings that glittered in the sunlight . He ($_shouto) also liked cats , rabbits , sometimes swans . Eventually he ($_shouto) couldn t hide any longer and would put the sculptures in the flowerbed to melt into the soil . At least he ($_shouto) understood the butterflies now . 
Shouto ($_shouto) started hoping he ($_shouto) d happen across Izuku ($_izuku) as he ($_shouto) was going about his ($_shouto) day . He ($_shouto) d look at he ($_shouto) guards he ($_shouto) d pass , hoping to see green curls and freckles but was so far unlucky . 
When he ($_shouto) did see Izuku ($_izuku) , he ($_shouto) was walking to the stables with Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) . She liked to go for longer rides around the castle grounds and Shouto ($_shouto) wanted to join her . By the stables , Izuku ($_izuku) stood with Momo ($_momo) , obviously trying his ($_izuku) best to stay at attention as she talked . He ($_izuku) was so focused , nodding along to her instructions and gesturing with his ($_izuku) hands when he ($_izuku) talked . 
Momo ($_momo) saw them first . She bowed , then waved at them . 
Princess Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) ! Lovely day today isn t it ? She asked . 
It really is . A perfect day for a ride around the grounds ! Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) said , taking a glance at Shouto ($_shouto) . 
Hey Momo ($_momo) . 
Hey yourself , Prince . Momo ($_momo) said , Stay out of trouble . 
She winked and if she were closer by she d probably punch him ($_izuku) in the arm playfully . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) s twinkling laugh carried and Shouto ($_shouto) finally was able to meet Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes . Izuku ($_izuku) seemed to chance a smile , eyes flitting to the oversized red boots on his ($_izuku) feet . Shouto ($_shouto) felt his ($_shouto) cheeks burn , and he ($_shouto) hoped he ($_shouto) wasn t actually blushing . He ($_shouto) held his ($_shouto) hand up in a small wave , and it took a moment for Izuku ($_izuku) look up to return the gesture . 
Then he ($_shouto) turned away , and Shouto ($_shouto) thought it best he ($_shouto) do the same . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) leaned over and whispered to ask if he ($_shouto) knew Izuku ($_izuku) , and he ($_shouto) responded with a shrug . 

So Shouto ($_shouto) went to Ochako ($_ochako) s cottage , telling those that it ($_shouto) concerned that he ($_shouto) needed to pick up his ($_shouto) burn ointment , lest he ($_shouto) get in trouble for sneaking around . He ($_shouto) knocked on the old wooden door , waiting for a moment before it opened . 
Your Highness ! Ochako ($_ochako) said brightly , her ($_ochako) pink cheeks glowing with warmth , What brings you here today ? 
The usual. Shouto ($_shouto) said , And I need a favor from you . 
Ochako ($_ochako) blinked , obviously thrown off , but she ($_ochako) smiled , Of course , Your Highness . 
Shouto ($_shouto) pulled a small piece of parchment from his ($_shouto) tunic and handed it to her ($_ochako) . It was folded in three , sealed with a red wax seal imprinted with a snowflake . 
Please give this to Izuku . he ($_shouto) said , Will you see him ($_shouto) soon ? 
I ll probably see him ($_shouto) later this evening . she ($_ochako) said , I ll be happy to pass this along . 
She ($_ochako) took the letter in her ($_ochako) hands , tucking it into the pocket of her ($_ochako) apron . 
I m sure he ($_shouto) ll be really happy to hear from you . Tsuyu said . She ($_ochako) d been in the corner of the cottage , sitting by the fire and stirring a large cast iron pot filled with an herbal-smelling broth . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s heart did a little jump in his ($_shouto) chest , but he ($_shouto) didn t let his ($_shouto) face betray that . 
Ochako ($_ochako) giggled . 
He ($_shouto) was just saying the other day how he ($_shouto) hoped to see you again . she ($_ochako) said , a hint of teasing in her ($_ochako) voice . 
Shouto ($_shouto) felt his ($_shouto) face grow hot , Did he ($_shouto) ? 
Yep , sure was ! Ochako ($_ochako) nodded before turning to a shelf behind her ($_ochako) and grabbing a small jar made of dark grey glass sealed with a copper lid . 
I ll give him ($_shouto) your note . Ochako ($_ochako) said , holding out the jar , And here s your medicine . 
He thanked her ($_ochako) , ducking under the dried herbs that hung from the ceiling in their neat little bundles of twine on his way to the door when he felt a warm but strong grip on his upper arm . He flinched on instinct , and Ochako ($_ochako) pulled her ($_ochako) hand back . He turned to meet her ($_ochako) steady gaze . 
Please be good to Deku . she ($_ochako) said , If you re using him for anything taking advantage of his feelings I promise I will do something about it . 
Her ($_ochako) threat was so calm it didn t even seem like a threat , in fact her ($_ochako) tone suggested worry . Her ($_ochako) boldness humbled Shouto ($_shouto) , as clearly she ($_ochako) wasn t afraid of him ($_shouto) even with the title he ($_shouto) held , and that was admirable . 
Shouto ($_shouto) kept his ($_shouto) eyes on hers ($_shouto) , hoping his ($_shouto) own sincerity was readable . Tsuyu stood up , her ($_ochako) webbed hands twitching by her ($_ochako) side . But Shouto ($_shouto) simply bowed his ($_shouto) head , dropping his ($_shouto) shoulders in humility . 
I give you my word . Shouto ($_shouto) said , I wouldn t dream of hurting him ($_shouto) . 
He ($_shouto) meant it . He ($_shouto) d never hurt anyone , if he ($_shouto) could help it , least of all Izuku . He ($_shouto) wasn t his ($_shouto) father , no matter how much his ($_shouto) father wanted him ($_shouto) to be . 
I ll hold you to that . Ochako ($_ochako) said , and Shouto ($_shouto) raised his ($_shouto) eyes to meet hers ($_ochako) , their usual mirth hidden behind a protective gaze that had Shouto a little nervous . 
As well you should . He ($_shouto) said . 

The note was an invitation to meet again at sunset the next night , the same place as before . Shouto ($_shouto) had been anxious about it all day , second guessing whether Izuku ($_izuku) would even want to meet with him ($_shouto) again . He ($_shouto) had to hold in the sigh of relief when he ($_shouto) saw Izuku ($_izuku) emerge from around a hedge . 
He ($_shouto) was still in his ($_shouto) guard uniform , minus the thick leather vest . The white undershirt looked a little baggy on him ($_shouto) when untucked from the dark green pants . Shouto ($_shouto) felt a little relieved that he ($_shouto) wasn t wearing the Todoroki family crest . 
Hi Shouto ($_shouto) . Izuku ($_izuku) greeted with a small , friendly wave , a shy smile on his ($_izuku) face . Shouto ($_shouto) smiled back . 
Hi. He ($_shouto) said , awkwardly . 
Neither of them were in sleep clothes this time , it felt more formal and therefore weird . They fidgeted for a moment , silent , waiting for the other to say something . 
You seem tense . Shouto ($_shouto) observed , Are you alright ? 
Izuku ($_izuku) pressed his ($_izuku) bandaged fingers together and looked at his ($_izuku) shoes . 
I m fine . He ($_izuku) said . 
Shouto ($_shouto) just nodded , Ah , that s good . He ($_izuku) felt deflated . Maybe this would be too weird after all . After all , what was there to say ? 
The warm evening breeze ruffled Izuku ($_izuku) s hair , and he ($_izuku) tucked a few curls behind his ($_izuku) ear before looking at Shouto ($_shouto) with a grin . 
I was able to control my magic better today . Izuku ($_izuku) offered , sitting down on the small stone wall that separated two sections of the grounds , It s been tough , but now I think I can fight better . 
Then he ($_izuku) blanched , a nervous laugh escaping him ($_izuku) . 
Maybe you don t want to hear that considering I m supposed to guard you . 
Shouto ($_shouto) let out a soft huff from his ($_shouto) nose , almost a laugh , It ($_shouto) s fine . he ($_shouto) said . He ($_shouto) sat next to Izuku , not really realizing how close he ($_shouto) d decided to get . Their thighs touched , but neither moved . 
Izuku ($_izuku) continued on this topic , talking about the guard . 
I always wanted to join , ever since I was little . My brother , though we aren t really related , he told me I couldn t. Izuku ($_izuku) said , He always made fun of me , for everything . I was a loser who d just take notes on magic , but would never be able to cast . 
That s awful . Shouto ($_shouto) could relate , in an odd way , He ($_shouto) seems like a terrible brother . 
Yeah , he ($_shouto) always said I ($_i) d amount to nothing . Or that I ($_i) d just have to settle as a farmhand 
Shouto ($_shouto) looked at him ($_shouto) , You ($_shouto) certainly proved him ($_shouto) wrong . 
Yeah , and he ($_shouto) s not happy about it . He ($_shouto) hates being wrong about as much as he ($_shouto) hates to lose . 
Turns out Katsuki ($_katsuki) was also on the guard , although he ($_katsuki) was usually not in the same vicinity as Izuku ($_izuku) , since he ($_katsuki) had the tendency to lose focus otherwise . Captain Nishiya quickly learned that they couldn t be around each other for too long . 
What about you ($_shouto) ? You ($_shouto) have a sister right ? The princess ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked , swinging his ($_izuku) legs . 
I have three siblings . I m the youngest . Shouto ($_shouto) said . 
Izuku ($_izuku) giggled , Then you ($_shouto) 're the baby of the family ! 
Shouto ($_shouto) blushed . He ($_shouto) was twenty and therefore an adult , but it wasn t like the phrase baby brother was rare amongst his ($_shouto) siblings . 
The only one he ($_shouto) saw frequently was Fuyumi_,_who_still_lived_at_the_castle_with_him ($_fuyumi) him ($_shouto) . She ($_fuyumi) was second oldest and easily had the most powerful magic . She ($_fuyumi) could summon blizzards and create beautiful snowflakes , she ($_fuyumi) was winter itself and all of its beauty . If anyone should be ruler of a kingdom it would be her ($_fuyumi) , kind but powerful . But she ($_fuyumi) didn t have their father s magic , so she ($_fuyumi) d been tossed aside like the other older siblings . 
The oldest had defected , his ($_natsuo) whereabouts unknown and his ($_natsuo) name changed , and the second youngest , Natsuo ($_natsuo) , had been born without an affinity and therefore had been neglected the most . He ($_natsuo) went to live with their mother in exile and pursue his ($_natsuo) studies . Shouto ($_shouto) envied that , in his ($_shouto) own way . 
Izuku ($_izuku) listened to him ($_shouto) carefully , Shouto ($_shouto) felt almost shy under such intent concentration . But he ($_shouto) kept talking , slowly , and was grateful when Izuku ($_izuku) would jump in every now and again . 
They went on to the subject of food , and from there many other tangents that made them lose track of where each conversation ended and began . Night had long since fallen , warm but with a breeze to cut the humidity . 
I ll see you ? Izuku ($_izuku) seemed bashful all of the sudden as they were finally parting ways . 
Soon. Shouto ($_shouto) finished , Sleep well , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
You - you too ! Izuku ($_izuku) managed to squeak out , hesitating a moment , eyes on Shouto ($_shouto) . Then he ($_izuku) waved and said a final goodbye before disappearing among the manicured hedges that made a sort of labyrinth around the grounds . Shouto ($_shouto) took a moment , collecting himself ($_shouto) , before he ($_izuku) headed back to the castle . 
It became routine , an arrangement of sorts , to meet up when they could . Shouto ($_shouto) looked forward to it ($_shouto) . They were rare moments of complete calm , times where he ($_izuku) felt like he ($_izuku) d found happiness in a place he ($_izuku) previously thought to be miserable through and through . 
Shouto ($_shouto) would look out the window to the while he ($_shouto) studied , liking to think that he ($_shouto) could see where Izuku ($_izuku) was . When his ($_shouto) his_father ($_shouto) lashed a tongue of fire at him ($_shouto) as part of training , he ($_shouto) d think that later that night he ($_shouto) could lean on Izuku s shoulder and listen to him ($_shouto) talk about whatever he ($_shouto) wanted . It didn t make it better , but it helped him ($_shouto) see light at the end of a very bleak darkness . 
What did you do to yourself this time ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked one evening , taking Izuku ($_izuku) s bandaged hand in both of his ($_izuku) . Often when Izuku ($_izuku) met up with him ($_izuku) , bruised and battered from the day , Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_izuku) worrying over him ($_izuku) . If Izuku ($_izuku) hated it he ($_izuku) he ($_izuku) never said so . 
Just what normally happens. Izuku ($_izuku) said with a shrug . He ($_izuku) must know how bad that sounds . 
It s not good that it s normal . Shouto ($_shouto) replied . 
Izuku ($_izuku) just made a noncommittal noise , shrugging his ($_izuku) concern off , as he ($_izuku) does frustratingly often . He ($_izuku) didn t want to burden others with concern , is what Shouto ($_shouto) had gathered . He ($_izuku) d rather carry that weight on his ($_izuku) own shoulders . 
Good to see you too , Shouto ($_shouto) . he ($_izuku) said wryly , smiling at him ($_izuku) . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes stayed on the bandages around Izuku ($_izuku) s arm , even when his ($_izuku) lips twitched into a little smile . The air was cool against his ($_izuku) face , crisp with the end of summer . 
The weather is changing . Shouto ($_shouto) said , We probably can t meet when it gets too cold . 
No , Izuku ($_izuku) shook his ($_izuku) head , curls bouncing , I m trying to think of what to do . 
Shouto ($_shouto) looked toward the tall stone towers of the castle that loomed overhead , I ($_i) wonder if I ($_i) could get you in ... 
I ($_i) don t know about that . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
I m serious . If I ($_i) requested a personal guard for my ($_i) quarters and had it be you Shouto ($_shouto) thought aloud , something he ($_shouto) really only did with Izuku around . 
That s risky . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
I ($_i) know , that s why I ($_i) haven t done it . Shouto wasn t stupid , even if he ($_shouto) was impulsive . And he ($_shouto) wasn t nearly as impulsive as Izuku ($_izuku) . 
Izuku ($_izuku) sighed , I ($_i) can t bring you back to the guards quarters . 
I ($_i) guess we ll figure something out . I ($_i) don t think I ($_i) could stay cooped up in a castle all winter and not see you . Shouto ($_shouto) said , hoping that didn t come off too strong . 
I ($_i) I ($_i) d miss you . Izuku ($_izuku) said lamely , but Shouto ($_shouto) felt warmed . 
It s It makes me ($_i) feel better to hear that . Not that I ($_i) want you to miss me ($_i) , I ($_i) d rather you not have to . I ($_i) don t want to miss you either . Shouto ($_shouto) rambled awkwardly . 
I ($_i) get what you mean . he ($_shouto) said . 
Shouto ($_shouto) set his ($_shouto) cold hand on Izuku ($_izuku) s bandaged one . 
Where does it hurt most ? 
Ah! My ($_i) wrist . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
Shouto s hand was ice cold as he ($_shouto) called his ($_shouto) magic to it , pressing his ($_shouto) palm to the side of Izuku ($_izuku) s bandaged wrist . 
Your magic is wonderful . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
Shouto ($_shouto) liked the way Izuku said that . Wonderful. Like it was something to behold , not a tool , not a weapon . 
Yours is incredible too . He ($_shouto) said simply . He ($_shouto) d seen it , in short bursts . It was unlike anything he ($_shouto) d ever seen , a power that Izuku ($_izuku) could call to his ($_izuku) whole body , light he ($_izuku) could manipulate and that ran in veins of purple over his ($_izuku) skin . 
It s incredible I even have it . Izuku ($_izuku) sounded oddly sarcastic and Shouto ($_shouto) wasn t sure what to make of that . 
You ll get there , magic isn t the same for everyone . 
Izuku ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) head away , Well you have an amazing affinity that s so natural to you . I can t help but be jealous . 
It s love hate for me . Shouto ($_shouto) replied . Izuku ($_izuku) looked at him ($_izuku) sidelong , eyes on his ($_izuku) before flitting away again . 
When will I see you use your fire ? He ($_izuku) asked . 
Never. Shouto ($_shouto) said a little too casually , conviction lying just under the surface that he ($_shouto) d kept for a long time . 
Shouto it s not his ($_shouto) magic . Izuku ($_izuku) said , finally facing him ($_shouto) again , It s yours and only yours . 
Sure it is . 
It absolutely is . Izuku ($_izuku) was starting to sound like he ($_izuku) was pleading , in an odd way , You re not your father , and you ll never be your father . 
Stop trying to convince me , it s not going to work . Shouto ($_shouto) snapped . Then he ($_izuku) regretted when he ($_izuku) saw Izuku ($_izuku) s expression fall . 
Shouto ($_shouto) 
My brother doesn t have an affinity and he ($_izuku) is doing pretty well for himself ($_izuku) . Shouto ($_shouto) said , Hell , he ($_izuku) even got to leave . Maybe I d prefer that . 
That doesn t mean it was easy for him ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) mumbled . 
You re really going to say that ? 
I would have killed for an affinity for the first twenty years of my life ! Izuku ($_izuku) exclaimed , I was miserable without one ! 
The pain in his ($_izuku) tone was undeniable , sharp enough to cut . Shouto ($_shouto) recoiled , biting the inside of his ($_shouto) cheek . The frustration in Izuku ($_izuku) that make his ($_shouto) heart hurt . 
Look , Shouto ($_shouto) . Izuku ($_izuku) s tone softened immediately . 
Shouto didn t look at him ($_shouto) , What ? 
It s not like I m upset with you . Izuku ($_izuku) said , I m frustrated , that s all . You have an amazing gift , and it d be amazing to see you use it . 
Shouto ($_shouto) hated it . 
I d just be playing into my father s hands . 
No you won t ! Izuku ($_izuku) s scarred hands planted on his ($_izuku) shoulders and his ($_izuku) face was set . On such an open sweet face , his ($_izuku) expression looked even more severe , enough so that Shouto ($_shouto) could feel the determination . 
You re not him ($_izuku) , Shouto ($_shouto) . Izuku ($_izuku) said , softening his ($_izuku) expression but keeping his ($_izuku) hands firm on his ($_izuku) upper arms , but I ($_izuku) guess I ($_izuku) understand why you wouldn t want to use it . It must be hard with what you ve gone through . He ($_izuku) wrapped his ($_izuku) arms around Shouto ($_shouto) s torso , burying his ($_izuku) face into his ($_izuku) shoulder . 
I know it might be awful of me to push you , sorry . 
Shouto ($_shouto) hugged back , tentatively . Izuku ($_izuku) had hugged him ($_izuku) once before , but it had been awkward , with Shouto frozen with his ($_izuku) hands by his ($_izuku) sides . Now he ($_izuku) welcomed it , the comfort and warmth it brought . 
I m also sorry . I understand why you re frustrated . Shouto ($_shouto) said . He ($_shouto) heard Izuku ($_izuku) chuckle against the dark fabric of his ($_shouto) shirt , and his ($_shouto) chest tightened , his ($_shouto) heart was pounding . He ($_shouto) adjusted his ($_shouto) arms around Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulders , holding him ($_shouto) closer and breathing in the beginnings of the autumn chill , melting into the embrace much as Izuku ($_izuku) melted back . 

You like him ($_shouto) . Momo ($_momo) sat by the edge of the pond , her sword in its sheath lying beside her . She was technically off duty for only a few hours , but that was enough time to find Shouto ($_shouto) s not-secret hiding spot and pay him ($_shouto) a visit . 
Excuse me ? Shouto ($_shouto) had been freezing a spot on the water s surface , then thawing it , over and over for five minutes . He ($_shouto) d been humming to himself ($_shouto) as his ($_shouto) fingertips ghosted over the water s surface , leaving a thin sheet of ice behind . 
I ve never seen you so happy . Momo ($_momo) said , You keep smiling , you re humming . 
Maybe it s just a nice day out . 
It was . Autumn fast approached in the way the trees started to turn brilliant red and orange against the cloudless blue of the sky . Though it was pleasantly warm , a cold snap in the breeze brought with it the smell of leaves and tinder . 
Oh please , you can t fool me . Momo ($_momo) said , tucking some stray hair behind her ear . 
I m not trying to . 
Momo ($_momo) threw a pebble into the water , it hit the thin crust of ice on the surface with a small crack before plunking into the water . 
You ve been having your little rendezvous nights with Midoriya all summer . Momo ($_momo) said , I think it s sweet . 
They re the only times I know any peace around here . Shouto ($_shouto) said , knees drawn to his ($_shouto) chest as he ($_shouto) lazily repaired the crack in the ice the pebble had made . 
And that is exactly what I mean . Momo ($_momo) said , Nobody has ever made you act this way , I ve never seen you like this . 
Shouto ($_shouto) sighed , knowing that Momo ($_momo) was right as always and knew him ($_shouto) well enough to pick up on these things . 
Nobody has ever made me feel how he ($_shouto) makes me feel . He ($_shouto) said finally , watching ice spread across the water like a spiderweb . 
And what feeling is that ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) held his ($_shouto) left hand out and the ice fizzled away , leaving the surface of the pond rippling , brilliant blue stained with red and orange reflections from the trees like a watercolor painting . 
It s a feeling of being warm , and safe . Shouto ($_shouto) said , It s. . . nice. 
Shouto ($_shouto) wished he ($_shouto) was a little better with words , he ($_shouto) was so clumsy . He ($_shouto) wanted to say that the feeling was like fire but it didn t sear , it was like sitting in firelight , bathed in warmth . 
Momo ($_momo) smiled , You re further gone than I thought . 
Shouto ($_shouto) s face turned red , and he ($_shouto) quickly looked away at Momo s giggle in response . 
That s not it , Shouto ($_shouto) said , Besides even if I did , nothing could come of it , so it s best that I don t. 
Nothing good could come from a relationship like theirs . Not with the vast difference in their social standing , with Shouto ($_shouto) s duties , with Izuku ($_izuku) s own dreams . Shouto ($_shouto) had little faith that the gods were on his ($_shouto) side , they d been against him ($_shouto) this long . 
Interesting. Momo ($_momo) said , brushing a stray lock of hair from her ($_don) eyes with calloused fingers , But even your ($_don) resolve to not fall for him ($_shouto) doesn t mean you ($_don) can t. Or already haven t. 
Don ($_don) t suggest that I have when I just said - . 
I m not just suggesting , Prince , I m outwardly telling you ($_don) , as a fact . Momo ($_momo) said , laughing lightly at Shouto s soured expression . 
And regardless , Midoriya ($_midoriya) is going to try what he can . 
What do you ($_don) mean ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked . 
Momo ($_momo) shrugged , He ($_momo) s rather sweet on you ($_don) , if you ($_don) haven t noticed . 
Shouto ($_shouto) did not like the flutter in his ($_shouto) stomach when she ($_shouto) said that , not one bit . 
I can t say I have . Shouto ($_shouto) said carefully , And you ($_don) re just saying that to fuck with me . 
Believe me or not , the point is that he ($_momo) s not going to give up . Midoriya ($_midoriya) is the type who will do what he ($_momo) can to get what he ($_momo) wants . 
Shouto ($_shouto) turned to her ($_shouto) , confused , and was met with a gentle smile , reassurance that Momo ($_momo) was always so good at giving . 
I know that he ($_momo) said , But I don t see where you ($_don) re going with this . 
Momo ($_momo) s smile just broadened . The breeze picked up and filled the air with the comforting sound of leaves rustling , almost like water rushing over rocks . 
What he ($_momo) wants is to be with you ($_don) . She said . 

King_Enji ($_king) had requested his ($_king) presence , as usual , and Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t refuse . He ($_king) knelt before the throne on one knee , his ($_king) black cloak spreading around him ($_king) like an ink spill , ice edging the fabric like it had been embroidered into it . He ($_king) never lowered his ($_king) head . His ($_king) father didn t deserve humility . 
Father . Shouto ($_shouto) said with little reverence . Enji ($_enji) watched him ($_king) like one watches a cockroach scurry across the floor . 
This year is a prosperous one , no ? He ($_king) asked . Shouto ($_shouto) hated this . When Enji ($_enji) liked to pontificate with empty pleasantries to add anticipation to what he ($_enji) was going to say . 
For that I am grateful . Shouto ($_shouto) replied . An acceptable response . 
Though it is not without its share of hardship . We lost our dear advisor , and it s so hard to follow in such a wise peacekeepers footsteps . Enji ($_enji) didn t sound like he ($_enji) believed his ($_enji) own words . He ($_enji) d nearly burned down the west wing of the castle when he ($_enji) got the news of the_All_Might ($_the) s passing . So badly had he ($_enji) wanted to overtake him ($_enji) , Shouto ($_shouto) would say by himself ($_enji) but that was a lie . Shouto ($_shouto) was to do that for him ($_enji) . 
But he ($_enji) has a successor , someone he ($_enji) handpicked . Enji s eyes flickered over Shouto ($_shouto) , Would you happen to know anything about that ? 
Shouto ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head , I ($_shouto) do not . 
It was the truth . He ($_shouto) d barely even known the_All_Might ($_the) . 
Nevertheless , Enji ($_enji) continued , That shouldn t be an issue for you , or your duty to the throne . I ($_shouto) expect you to take care of this successor should they arise . The Todoroki lineage deserves more than to be governed by others as subjects . 
Shouto really didn t like where this conversation was headed . The room was hot from the fires and Enji s own magic burning around him . He kept that flashy display of power even when in the presence of his family . A reminder , no doubt . 
Your twenty-first birthday approaches with the coming winter . Enji ($_enji) continued , voice suggesting that Shouto ($_shouto) should know what this means . 
Yes father . 
With this years Pyre I wish to have you make your debut as my chosen heir . You aren t fully trained to where I want you to be , what with your petulant refusal to use your magic , but perhaps the prospect of betrothal will whip you into shape . 
Pyre celebrates royalty , the Todoroki ($_todoroki) s . It used to only be kept within the family , but as time went on it became a day-long festival open to anyone in the kingdom , though was mostly attended by nobility and those who lived at the capital city . And this year , with Shouto ($_shouto) s birthday , it was the time for potential partners to present themselves , vying for a chance at the throne by winning Shouto ($_shouto) s hand in marriage . What they really had to do was win Enji ($_enji) s approval , what Shouto ($_shouto) thought means nothing . 
You know your duty . Enji ($_enji) said . Shouto ($_shouto) rolled his ($_shouto) eyes . Marry a powerful magic user to bring strength to the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line . He ($_shouto) d heard the lecture before . It disgusted him ($_shouto) really , as his ($_shouto) father had married his ($_shouto) mother for that purpose . Her family knew her power and had her join the line of potential partners . It s quite possible she never saw them again after her marriage and crowning as Queen Rei Todoroki . She certainly never saw the life she deserved after that . 
Assuming anyone wants to ask for my hand . Shouto ($_shouto) replied curtly . 
Don ($_don) t be ridiculous . Enji ($_enji) barked , Your standing alone will garner plenty . Everyone wants to marry a future king . 
Mother didn t. Shouto said . 
You watch your mouth . Enji s voice lowered dangerously , Your mother chose to court me , she chose the life of a queen . 
Shouto ($_shouto) set his ($_shouto) mouth into a hard line . 
You courted her , and her family s favor . If they d known what you were she would have never done it . 
Enji ($_enji) rose from his ($_enji) throne , towering over Shouto ($_shouto) in a wreath of flame . Shouto ($_shouto) tensed but he ($_enji) didn t show fear , jaw set and eyes unwavering on his ($_enji) father . 
The ice on his ($_enji) cloak and by his ($_enji) feet sizzled away with the growing heat of Enji ($_enji) s fire . Dry fingers brushed over the marred skin around his ($_enji) eye , and Shouto ($_shouto) grit his ($_enji) teeth . 
Even after ruining your face you remain so loyal to her . Enji ($_enji) said , contempt dripping from his ($_enji) voice , She ($_enji) s the one who hurt you . 
Fire licked at his ($_enji) nose , not enough to burn but enough to make him ($_enji) flinch . 
You ve done worse . 
Out of my sight . Enji ($_enji) snarled , his ($_enji) palm cracking against Shouto ($_shouto) s left cheek , And be on your best behavior , your looks won t cover up your sharp tongue , not with that hideous scar . 
Shouto ($_shouto) pressed his ($_shouto) cold hand to his ($_shouto) stinging cheek . 
Which you may blame yourself for as well . Shouto ($_shouto) muttered . 
Even with his ($_shouto) head held high , a sinking weight started to settle in his ($_shouto) stomach , making him ($_shouto) feel slightly sick . He ($_shouto) turned on his ($_shouto) heel and walked away , hoping to maintain himself ($_shouto) until he ($_shouto) was behind closed doors . 
Shouto ($_shouto) . his ($_shouto) father said . Shouto ($_shouto) stopped walking , but he ($_shouto) didn t turn to acknowledge Enji ($_enji) . 
I want this successor taken care of before your wedding day . It should be a celebration , of our power , of the Todoroki family line . I d hate for anything to stand in the way of such a special occasion . 
Ice crawled from Shouto ($_shouto) s fingertips up his ($_shouto) arm , but he ($_shouto) was silent , waiting . 
And remember this , as long as I am king , dear Shouto , I always have the final say .
