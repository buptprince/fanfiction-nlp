It rains heavily for the next few days . Summer storms , Shoto ($_shoto) calls it , and Momo ($_momo) backs him ($_shoto) up . While the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) is generally quite cool , the summer can get hot , but not until after the storms . They ($_the) both are prepared for the event , but no one else quite knows what to expect . It s been raining a lot recently anyway , an almost constant drizzle that dampens the mood . The push on under an ugly grey sky regardless , their goal almost visible now . 
Shoto ($_shoto) is right , they realise . The temperatures are rising . Summer is swiftly coming to an end , but the heat only continues to bear down , muffled slightly by the cloud cover . Not only is it raining , but the winds have picked up in the last few hours as well . Ochako ($_ochako) has suggested multiple times that they take a break , find some shelter and wait out the worst of it . But Shoto and Izuku ($_izuku) are determined to reach the crown city , disregarding the words of anyone else . 
They only listen when Tenya finally cracks and tells them that there is no point in traversing the landscape when they can barely see ten feet in front of them due to the rain coming at them almost horizontally . Eventually , their determination cracks , making way for tiredness , and they agree to only keep moving until they find suitable shelter for the night . Everyone else silently cheers . 
The path they walk is mountainous - Momo ($_momo) informs them that this is the highest peak in the entirety of the country , despite it being an anomaly - it s not in any mountain range . Shoto ($_shoto) adds that the crown city was built behind it for a reason ; it acts as a last line of defence for any potential attackers . Those words seem even more potent now given the situation . Perhaps that is what King Enji is so scared of . 
There s a lot of caves along here , apparently . They re marked on Momo ($_momo) s map , though she doesn t dare bring it out just to watch the ink run and ruin the carefully drawn lines put in place by a master map maker . She s had the map as long as she remembers , and isn t about to lose it now just because Katsuki ($_katsuki) is getting impatient . 
A rumble comes from the side of the cliff . Izuku ($_izuku) says to ignore it and continues on . Ochako ($_ochako) is left to wonder if perhaps the mountain is actually a volcano - that would make a lot of sense to her . Her train of thought is quickly cut off by the two natives of the Northern Kingdom , who confirm that the mountain is , in fact , just a mountain . Ochako ($_ochako) pouts a little at this - her ($_ochako) theory was much cooler , she ($_ochako) thinks . 
A second rumble comes a little further on the path , and this time Ochako ($_ochako) points out that maybe they should stop right now immediately in case something happens . But her ($_ochako) complaints go ignored under the sound of the wind , and they push on . 
A third rumble comes . 
And then a fourth . 
And then a fifth , with mud sliding down the sheer side of the tallest mountain in the country , the speed picking up as it travels further downhill . Ochako ($_ochako) is stuck to the spot , and to save her ($_ochako) ass from getting swept away , Katsuki ($_katsuki) reaches out t grab her ($_ochako) , pulling her ($_ochako) out of the path of the mud . The mud , now with boulders and parts of trees and what looks almost like a small house in it continues to slide down the mountain until more than half an hour later it stops , in a huge pile splitting Katsuki and Ochako ($_ochako) from the rest of the group . The sound of the landslide was too loud for the two groups to communicate , but now that it s stopped -LRB- or at least slowed -RRB- , the two can yell at each other . 
Are you two okay ? Izuku ($_izuku) calls first , his ($_izuku) voice sounding surprisingly far away . 
Shut the fuck up Deku , of course we re fine ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) yells , before turning back to Ochako . You are okay , right ? 
I m fine . Just a bit surprised , that s all . 
What do you want to do ? It s not safe enough for you to cross ! Momo ($_momo) cries . She has a point . The wall of mud is still wet - it d take a miracle for them to get over . They re enclosed in with no way around - to their right is the solid wall of the mountain , and to their right is a cliff like drop . 
Can t you use magic ? Can you get us over there ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) suggests , but she ($_katsuki) vehemently shakes her ($_katsuki) head . 
I don t want to risk it . I probably could get one of us across , but the other would be stuck here . I m tired , so my stock of magical energy is lowered ... and I don t want to drop either of us in the mud . I m sure it wouldn t end well . 
What about your dragon ? Comes the call from the other side , this time Tenya . 
He s a Wyvern , four eyes ! And I have no idea where he is ! He took off a while ago ; he s probably up the mountain somewhere ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) hollers back , and Ochako ($_ochako) can only sigh , taking matters into her ($_katsuki) own hands . 
Why don t you four go on ahead and find shelter ? She ($_katsuki) suggests . We can backtrack for a bit and see what we can find ! 
I really don t think that s safe ... Izuku s concern is practically palpable through the mud wall , but Ochako ($_ochako) is certain . 
It s not safe to just stand here either ! There s a good chance of more mudslides , and we ll all get sick with the rain . 
She ($_katsuki) has a point , she ($_katsuki) can hear Shoto say , barely audible . 
We ll meet up at the next town . It s not too far from here once you get off the mountain path . I trust you ll be able to find it safely ? 
We ll be fine , Momo ($_momo) ! Ochako ($_ochako) calls . You stay safe ! 
And that goes double for you ! 
They part ways then , Katsuki and Ochako ($_ochako) heading back south , retracing their steps . Ochako ($_ochako) is convinced that she ($_ochako) saw a cave not too far back , but she ($_ochako) wasn t sure where . It would be at least half an hour s walk back , if she ($_ochako) counted right . And half an hour walking side by side with Katsuki Bakugo wasn t something she ($_ochako) was exactly elated about . She ($_ochako) was exhausted anyway , and even he seemed to be tiring . Their feet drag along the path , and Ochako ($_ochako) suddenly remembers that they haven t stopped for dinner yet . It s not as late as she ($_ochako) originally thought - perhaps seven in the evening , but the storm clouds covering the sky makes it feel closer to midnight . 
There! She ($_ochako) calls suddenly , causing the blond to stop a little ways ahead and turn back to her ($_ochako) , the scowl on his face made less threatening by the water dripping down his face . 
What , round face ? 
Up there! A cave . I knew I saw one ! 
And how the fuck are we getting up there in this weather ? If it was dry I d be all for climbing , but I m not breaking my fucking neck because of one of your stupid ideas . Let s just keep moving . I d rather walk all the way to the bottom of the mountain than die , thanks . 
Wait, wait! I can get us up there with magic ! It s a short distance , so I can safely get you up , and then you can pull me up . By her ($_ochako) estimates , it was only eight feet in the air , and while there was no guarantee that the cave would be sizeable , it was better than nothing . 
Fuck off. You can use gravity magic ? 
I thought that was obvious from our earlier conversation . 
I was trying to figure out how to make us not die , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says bluntly . 
Do you want to try or not ? 
Fine . But if you drop me , you re dead ! 
I ll take your word for it . 
She ($_ochako) pulls her ($_ochako) staff out from under the layers of her ($_ochako) cloak , holding it out in front of her ($_ochako) , pointed at Katsuki ($_katsuki) . She ($_ochako) mumbles an incantation , and then with a glowing blue light from the staff , Katsuki ($_katsuki) is lifted a few feet into the air . He ($_katsuki) stutters in shock - as if he ($_katsuki) wasn t convinced she ($_ochako) could actually do it . She ($_ochako) steers him ($_katsuki) into the gap of the cave , and once his ($_katsuki) feet disappear into the cave and he ($_katsuki) yells that it s all good , she ($_ochako) releases the spell that keeps him ($_katsuki) floating . She ($_ochako) takes a deep breath , trying to steady the nauseous feeling that has settled in her ($_ochako) stomach . Katsuki ($_katsuki) puts his ($_katsuki) head out the cave entrance , his ($_katsuki) face a mixture of anger and awe . 
That was fucking cool . 
Thank you . 
Ochako ($_ochako) casts a tiny spell on herself ($_ochako) to make herself ($_ochako) weightless - the simplest of gravity spells , she ($_ochako) has discovered . Katsuki ($_katsuki) holds a hand out to her ($_ochako) , and she ($_ochako) gets a grip on the face of the mountain and pulls herself ($_ochako) up a little until she ($_ochako) can grab his hand and he pulls her ($_ochako) into the cave . To her ($_ochako) delight , she ($_ochako) finds that the cave is reasonably sizeable - large enough for the both of them plus Lord Explosion Murder , should he return . In the centre of the cave lies the remains of someone else s fire , thankfully dry . This was one thing Ochako ($_ochako) was worried about - it would be cold tonight , as there was no hope of finding any dry wood . But as she ($_ochako) holds her ($_ochako) hands over it , she ($_ochako) s delighted to find that it s still smouldering - someone had been here just before them . 
She ($_ochako) turns to Katsuki , who has removed his cape and is using it to dry his hair , to little avail . She ($_ochako) turns away quickly , because without his cape on his essentially half naked , and it s rude to stare at him . She ($_ochako) turns back again a few seconds later , complaining that he should offer her ($_ochako) the cape so she ($_ochako) can dry herself ($_ochako) first because she ($_ochako) s a lady , and he was a gentleman . He gives her ($_ochako) a rude finger gesture instead , not that she ($_ochako) should ve expected anything else . Her ($_ochako) bag of things is left on Iida s horse , along with a towel that she ($_ochako) could really use right about now . She ($_ochako) wrings the water out from her ($_ochako) skirt and removes her ($_ochako) own cloak , as well as the hood she ($_ochako) wears under it . She ($_ochako) never thought she ($_ochako) would miss that bag , but being without string to use as a makeshift clothesline causes a pang in her ($_ochako) stomach that she ($_ochako) pretends has nothing to do with homesickness . 
Can you light the fire ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks when Katsuki ($_katsuki) decides he ($_katsuki) s dry enough and has turned back to her ($_ochako) . 
I m not like half-and-half . I can t do fire . 
I meant with the sticks , she ($_ochako) points out , narrowing her ($_ochako) eyes at him ($_katsuki) . He ($_katsuki) averts his ($_katsuki) gaze and gets to work . 
Right. 
Did you mean something else ? She ($_ochako) smiles , kneeling beside him ($_katsuki) as he ($_katsuki) angrily rubs the sticks together in a vain attempt to light the fire . 
Fuck off , he ($_katsuki) answers , his ($_katsuki) voice gruff . Ochako ($_ochako) could tell he ($_katsuki) was hiding something - a slip of the tongue perhaps . 
Can you do magic ? Is that what you were going to say ? But forgot you hadn t told me ? 
Fuck off! He ($_katsuki) repeats , angrier this time . 
I had no idea you were a mage ! 
Shut the fuck up , Ochako ($_ochako) ! He ($_katsuki) yells , and she ($_ochako) smiles smugly , as making him ($_katsuki) lose his ($_katsuki) temper . As he ($_katsuki) speaks , there s an explosion in one palm , and the stick he ($_katsuki) was holding lights on fire . He ($_katsuki) drops it on the fire with a huff , before turning on the brunette , another explosion crackling in his ($_katsuki) hand . He ($_katsuki) aims it at her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) s prepared , and sidesteps the brunt of the blast , grabbing her ($_ochako) staff in the middle of the movement and casting the floating spell on him ($_katsuki) again . 
Don t yell at me , she ($_ochako) says calmly . We have to get along , since we re stuck together for the_night ($_the) . So please don t make this harder than it already is . 
Put me down ! He ($_katsuki) shouts , clearly ignoring her ($_ochako) request for him ($_katsuki) to stop yelling . I m fucking serious ! 
Release ! She ($_ochako) says , lowering her ($_ochako) staff , watching him ($_katsuki) fall to the floor with no remorse . 
What the fu - He ($_katsuki) starts , but she ($_ochako) holds her ($_ochako) staff up again and he ($_katsuki) immediately closes his ($_katsuki) mouth . 
She ($_ochako) sits by the fire , ignoring his ($_katsuki) outbursts , and eventually he ($_katsuki) sits too , opposite her ($_ochako) , feet warming by the steadily growing fire . He ($_katsuki) stares into the flames , avoiding all eye contact with her ($_ochako) . Yet she ($_ochako) watches him ($_katsuki) . His ($_katsuki) face is a lot smoother when it s not twisted into a scowl , all lines of anger gone . The firelight casts a strange flickering glow over his ($_katsuki) face , accenting his ($_katsuki) strong features , and Ochako ($_ochako) has to wrench her ($_ochako) gaze away from him ($_katsuki) in case he ($_katsuki) notices her ($_ochako) staring . Once she ($_ochako) turns her ($_ochako) attention to poking the fire it s his ($_katsuki) turn to admire her ($_ochako) - not that he ($_katsuki) was doing that at all . Her ($_ochako) chocolate eyes are warmer in the dim light , and despite her ($_ochako) hair being damp from the rain it s somehow sitting nicely , framing her ($_ochako) face . She ($_ochako) bites down on her ($_ochako) lip as if she ($_ochako) s concentrating on a troubling thought , and it s then that his ($_katsuki) stomach rumbles . 
I guess it s been a long time since we ve eaten , huh ? She ($_ochako) says with a smile , picking at the hem of her ($_ochako) skirt . He ($_katsuki) rummages around behind him ($_katsuki) , and pulls out a bag . Ochako ($_ochako) s eyes light up - she ($_ochako) hadn t even noticed he ($_katsuki) was carrying anything . Katsuki ($_katsuki) grumbles slightly as he ($_katsuki) hands across a roll of bread , Ochako ($_ochako) taking it with great enthusiasm . He ($_katsuki) pulls out a flask too , and while depleted , it ll be enough to get them through the_night ($_the) . They eat in silence , and one all the crumbs are gone , Ochako ($_ochako) scoots round to sit beside Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
Hey , what the fuck do you think you re fucking doing ? 
It s freezing , she ($_ochako) says bluntly . We need to stay close for warmth . 
Bullshit , he ($_katsuki) says , but doesn t move . 
Hey , y know earlier ? She ($_ochako) starts , eager to ask a question that s been burning in her ($_ochako) mind for a while . 
Like lunchtime earlier or raining earlier ? Be more specific. 
When we were fighting earlier . Did you call me by my name ? Like , my actual name , not a nickname ? 
No . 
You did ! I know I heard you say it . Her ($_ochako) face lights up with glee , while his shoulders hunch , forming a protective shell around himself . 
So what if I did ? He counters after a second . 
Then I will be glad , because that means we re friends . Her ($_ochako) grin almost wins him over when he turns to face her ($_ochako) , but he grits his teeth instead . 
We are not friends . And we never will be . 
I ll remind you that you said that when we are friends . 
I have no friends , and I don t intend on starting now , floaty bitch . 
Wow , that stings , Ochako ($_ochako) says , feigning offence and putting a hand to her ($_ochako) heart . 
At that , there s a loud sound from outside , almost reminiscent of lightning striking a tree , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) is immediately on his ($_katsuki) feet , looking out the cave entrance . With a grin on his ($_katsuki) face he ($_katsuki) guides in Lord Explosion Murder , who makes himself ($_katsuki) comfy on the stone floor . The wyvern curls itself round with what Ochako ($_ochako) can only describe as a smug expression . She ($_ochako) never thought she ($_ochako) would meet one of these supposedly extinct reptilian creatures , but as she ($_ochako) pats its nose , it exhales warm breath onto her ($_ochako) skin and she ($_ochako) can t help but smile . While he looks scary , he s essentially like a giant cat . 
He s warm , Katsuki ($_katsuki) points out , staring intently at Ochako ($_ochako) . 
Right ... she ($_ochako) answers , prompting him to continue . 
So you can lean against him to sleep . I promise he won t move out from underneath you during the_night ($_the) . 
Oh. Right! 
And she ($_ochako) does just that , grabbing her ($_ochako) cloak to use as a blanket . The underside of Lord Explosion Murder s belly is soft , devoid of scales , and she ($_ochako) can easily rest her ($_ochako) head against it . To her ($_ochako) surprise , Katsuki ($_katsuki) settles himself ($_katsuki) beside her ($_ochako) , his ($_katsuki) own cape wrapped around his ($_katsuki) shoulders again . She ($_ochako) smiles tiredly at him ($_katsuki) , and rather than glaring back at her ($_ochako) , he ($_katsuki) does a sort of grimace , before closing his ($_katsuki) eyes , head resting against Lord Explosion Murder . The wyvern gives a tired grunt too , clearly what the two do to communicate that it s time to sleep . 
Goodnight , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , she ($_ochako) offers , not expecting an answer . 
Night , Ochako ($_ochako) . 
It s only when Lord Explosion Murder squirms particularly violently that Ochako ($_ochako) wakes , sun streaming through the entrance to the cave to tell her ($_ochako) it s morning . In the daylight , she ($_ochako) can see that the cave is a lot bigger than she ($_ochako) originally thought - the firelight from last night didn t help the cave at all . She ($_ochako) s still not fully awake , and after she ($_ochako) blinks the sleep from her ($_ochako) eyes , she ($_ochako) realises that to her ($_ochako) horror , in her ($_ochako) sleep , her ($_ochako) head has fallen on to Katsuki s shoulder . She ($_ochako) doesn t know what s worse - that , or the fact that he has slumped sideways into her ($_ochako) , and his head is resting on her ($_ochako) own . 
He hasn t awoken yet - he s probably used to the beast moving about since they ve been together for so many years . She ($_ochako) manages to prise her ($_ochako) way out from under him without him waking up , making her ($_ochako) way outside to wash herself ($_ochako) . The water was slightly stagnant - just rainwater that had gathered in puddles - but it was better than smelling for the rest of the day . When she ($_ochako) returns to the cave , having to float herself ($_ochako) up once more , Katsuki ($_katsuki) is already awake , beginning to pack their things up . Lord Explosion Murder flies out , leaving the two alone . Ochako ($_ochako) puts her ($_ochako) cape on - it ($_ochako) s dry now , thankfully . 
Is it ($_ochako) raining ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks gruffly . 
No , thankfully . Hopefully we can get over that mud wall today . 
Don t hold your breath , round face . 
As they exit the cave , Katsuki ($_katsuki) clambers down the cliff face without much of a problem . Ochako ($_ochako) stands atop , not wanting to use her ($_ochako) magic power this early in the morning , and certainly not on an empty stomach . Katsuki ($_katsuki) stares up at her ($_ochako) , and feeling uncomfortable , she ($_ochako) pulls at the hem of her ($_ochako) skirt . 
Well? 
I can t see a way down . 
Jump . I ll catch you . 
I don t trust you not to drop me . 
Not my fucking problem , then . Sticking his hands in his pockets , he begins to walk away . Ochako ($_ochako) calls after him , not wanting to be abandoned on the cliff edge . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) ! 
Either you jump or I leave you up there . Up to you . 
I ll jump , she nods , voice small , nervous . He holds his arms out as she does so , landing in his arms just as she d aimed to . He ungraciously tips her onto her feet , and walks away in a huff . Ochako ($_ochako) swears the tips of his ($_ochako) ears are reddened , but she decides not to comment on it . They walk in silence , not that she can complain about that - it s too early in the morning for conversation . She s never been a morning person , and as far as she can tell from her limited experience , neither is Katsuki ($_katsuki) . It s only when they reach the mudslide almost an hour later that they speak again . 
Are you going to float us ? He asks bluntly . Clearly , he thinks this is the best idea , but she has other ideas . 
I ($_i) don t want to . I ($_i) always get sick , and since I ($_i) haven t eaten anything yet today , I ($_i) have no energy . 
Well , we can t climb over it . The mud is still wet . 
You could call Lord Explosion Murder , Ochako ($_ochako) suggests . He ($_ochako) could fly us over , no bother . 
He ($_ochako) doesn t fucking listen to me ($_i) . Never has. He ($_ochako) only sticks round with me ($_i) because I ($_i) feed him ($_ochako) . I m sure he ($_ochako) ll be cranky because I ($_i) couldn t feed him ($_ochako) this morning . 
Sounds like someone else I ($_i) know , Ochako ($_ochako) jokes , but unsurprisingly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) doesn t find it funny . 
What the fuck did you say ? 
Joking! She says quickly , waving her hands in front of her to show she meant no harm . 
Anyway. How the hell are we getting over this ? 
A sound of horse hooves from behind them makes them turn around in surprise - perhaps Tenya and Momo had come to their rescue by finding another way around ? But of course , their luck had run out long ago , and a short man stares at them . His eyes widen with delight when he gets a good look at Ochako ($_ochako) , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) defensively steps in front of her ($_katsuki) , one hand on his axe . 
Who the fuck are you ? He asks , and before the man can answer , there s a cry of excitement from behind him . 
I d recognise that voice anywhere ! The voice comes . It s clearly male , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) perks up - he knows the person , Ochako ($_ochako) realises , and she ($_ochako) relaxes . 
Katsuki ($_katsuki) relaxes too , rolling his ($_katsuki) eyes in defeat . A huge bird lands atop the wall of mud , and one of two riders atop the raven slides down the mud , clearly not caring about getting dirty . The young man , with bright red hair , grins at Katsuki ($_katsuki) , offering his hand for him to shake . The blond takes it , and as he does , more people appear from behind the horse . It looks to Ochako like a gang , and she ($_ochako) has to pray that Katsuki ($_katsuki) hasn t intentionally led her ($_ochako) here so they can steal what little belongings she ($_ochako) has . 
Ooh , who is this ? One girl calls to the red haired man . Her ($_ochako) hair is pink , and her ($_ochako) skin oddly seems to match . With her ($_ochako) are another two girls - one with dark hair and one that resembles a frog . Another two people arrive behind them - two boys , one of which has a shock of blond hair brighter than Katsuki ($_katsuki) s , and another with a perplexed expression . 
This is my friend . 
You don t have friends apart from us , she ($_ochako) points out , and he rolls his eyes . 
The explosions expert , he reminds her ($_ochako) , and her ($_ochako) eyes widen with surprise . 
I thought you said he lived in a cave ? 
He did , but clearly he s not anymore . 
Will you damn extras stop talking about me as if I m not right here ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) yells , effectively shutting them up . 
I thought you said you didn t do friends , Ochako ($_ochako) reminds quietly . 
We re not friends , Katsuki ($_katsuki) mutters through gritted teeth . Kirishima ($_kirishima) and his ($_kirishima) idiots are more like acquaintances . 
He ($_kirishima) told us if anything ever went down with the people who ran us out of our city he ($_kirishima) d help us , and that goes vice versa , the red haired man , Kirishima ($_kirishima) , Ochako assumes , explains . 
You were run out of your city ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , confused . Izuku ($_izuku) had told her that he ($_izuku) was exiled , but run out seems to imply something else . 
No ! He ($_izuku) snaps . That s not what he ($_izuku) meant . 
Anyway , Bakugo , who s this ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins , raising his ($_izuku) eyebrows at the brown haired girl by his ($_izuku) side . 
Round face , introduce yourself . 
Ochako_Uraraka ($_uraraka) , she ($_uraraka) sighs , smiling despite her ($_uraraka) annoyance with Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
And why are you two travelling together ? The blonde haired boy in the gang asks . 
Kaminari , the pink haired girl hisses , and he shrugs . 
I m just asking , Mina , jeez . 
We got separated from the rest of the group we re travelling with because of this mudslide , and we now have no way of meeting back up with them , she ($_uraraka) explains with a sheepish smile . 
Tokoyami can lift you both over on Dark Shadow , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , gesturing to the bird on the mudslide . Its ($_kirishima) rider nods mutely , and guides the bird to the ground . Ochako ($_ochako) hops on first , and as the bird takes off she ($_uraraka) s sure she ($_uraraka) pulls out a few feathers because she ($_uraraka) s holding on so tight . Katsuki ($_katsuki) arrives a minute after herself ($_uraraka) , and then Kirishima ($_kirishima) , who shakes Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand once more . The red haired man whispers something in his ($_katsuki) ear , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares at him ($_katsuki) , gritting his ($_katsuki) teeth as he ($_katsuki) turns away . 
What was that about ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks him ($_katsuki) as they walk on . She ($_uraraka) pulls the map out of her ($_uraraka) pouch , trying to figure out the best path to the town they were supposed to meet up with everyone else at . 
Never mind , round face .
