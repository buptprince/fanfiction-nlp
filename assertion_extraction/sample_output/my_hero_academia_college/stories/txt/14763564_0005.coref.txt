Explosion_boy ($_izuku) untied was surprisingly tame , clawing his ($_izuku) way down the castle slowly only to roll his ($_izuku) eyes at other swinging down past him ($_izuku) on a rope . The stoic male apparently the more energetic of the two . . 
Having long since passed Bakugou , the redhead was about to touch the grass with his ($_izuku) bare toe only to stop suddenly and curl up like a cat . 
`` W-will it be cold ? '' 
`` Not with this sun , I think you 'll enjoy how it feels . '' Izuku ($_izuku) comforted , as the_boy ($_izuku) dared to tap at it ($_izuku) . Soft, but sturdy. Earthy with mud but the feeling refreshingly cleanly . This must have been enough , as he ($_bakugou) found himself ($_bakugou) slipping down entirely . 
`` It feels good . '' He ($_bakugou) whispered , curling his ($_bakugou) toes before suddenly sinking down and craddling the earth like it was to be savoured . 
Had n't he ($_bakugou) ever left barefoot before ? 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) rolled his ($_bakugou) eyes , though admittedly slightly tempted to indulge the view from above of the sprawled out male . The way his ($_bakugou) body rolled was like a cat indeed , his ($_bakugou) hair tilted backwards off of his ($_bakugou) forehead messily . He ($_bakugou) would n't even be surprised if he ($_bakugou) landed beside him ($_bakugou) and heard purring . 
Of course , that did n't happen . 
He ($_bakugou) walked up to the boy and kicked his ($_bakugou) hip lightly , joking despite himself ($_bakugou) as he ($_bakugou) mocked . `` Whatever the fuck you 're doing you better not pull this shit in the city . '' 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) could n't help himself ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) was smiling , having expected the boy to be somewhat neater and more reserved with the way he ($_bakugou) dressed and the fineness of his ($_bakugou) clothing , seeing him ($_bakugou) lose his ($_bakugou) composure like this and open up was enlightening . 
Shouto ($_shouto) sat up right suddenly , his ($_shouto) eyes distant . `` Father 's gon na kill me ($_shouto) . '' 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) raised his ($_bakugou) eyebrow . 
What followed next had Bakugou ($_bakugou) entirely puzzled and frowning with one eyebrow raised , picking up bits of phrases as the_boy ($_izuku) scrambled up to play in the flowers , dip his ($_izuku) feet in the water , and giggle quietly as he ($_izuku) splashed around . He ($_izuku) ran in circles , agile and even started to surprise Bakugou ($_bakugou) with his ($_izuku) fitness : cartwheels , high kicks , front flips and spins . 
Izuku ($_izuku) joined in too before Bakugou ($_bakugou) had the last of it , yelling that he ($_bakugou) should `` hurry the fuck up '' . 
This led to Shouto scampering away into the darker parts of the clearing . Behind rocks , under cliffs , into the entrance of the clearing , pulling back to run under some trees as if taking cover . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was just about ready to rip his ($_bakugou) hair out with the constant soft spoken , self-depreciating whispers to his ($_bakugou) fucking fairy . 
`` But he ($_bakugou) wo n't even notice . . we 'll be back in a day or two and he ($_bakugou) 'll be gone for three . '' 
`` Maybe I should turn back ? '' 
`` I wish I could stay here forever . . !" 
`` I 'm going back . '' 
`` This is so fun ! haha . . !" 
`` I 'm horrible . . father trusted me . '' 
`` There must have been a reason for him ($_bakugou) to do this . ." 
`` But that was before I met Bakugou ($_bakugou) ! I 'll be fine ! '' 
`` He-He just wanted to keep me safe . '' 
`` What if he thinks I 'm gone and leaves again . ." 
It ended with Shouto ($_shouto) sitting in a dark corner between a huge rock and a huger cliff , resting his ($_shouto) head in his ($_shouto) lap as his ($_shouto) shoulders shook quietly . 
Izuku ($_izuku) stood awkwardly on his ($_izuku) knee with his ($_izuku) hand stroking at his ($_izuku) hair and sympathetic eyes . Even besides the fairy , the_boy ($_izuku) looked tiny . Almost like a pitiful child . 
`` Look Shouto ($_shouto) , '' Bakugou ($_bakugou) knelt before him ($_izuku) and snatched his ($_izuku) face from his ($_izuku) hiding place , red tinted orbs looking up at him ($_izuku) widely , weakly . 
`` From what I ($_izuku) 've heard , your ($_izuku) father 's a fucking protective guy . '' 
`` H-he is . '' Shouto ($_shouto) nodded . 
`` I ($_izuku) 'd hate to say it , but if by any chance he did notice you were gone the poor guy would be devastated . '' 
"Devastated?" He looked up with his mouth in an ` O ' . 
"Yeah." He sighed and looked and Shouto sadly . `` If my kid did that to me , I 'd be heartbroken too . I 'd probably never look at him again . '' 
He remembered some of Shouto_'s ($_'s) words . 
`` I 'd honestly leave . Just give up on him and find somebody else who appreciates me more . Why should I stick around for somebody who clearly does n't love me back , someone who does n't even care ? ." 
Pools of tears gathered in Shouto 's eyes . Before it could reach the blond 's sense of sympathy , he stood up abruptly and took Shouto_'s ($_'s) hand . 
`` Listen , ca n't do this shit anymore . '' 
Shouto_'s ($_'s) head jerked up to him puzzled . 
`` I ca n't let you do this to yourself . I 'm breaking our deal . '' He explained as if it were entirely his decision to make . 
`` I 'll take you back to your tower safely as promised , get back my crown , and you can wait patiently for your daddy dearest who wo n't even have noticed a thing - '' 
`` Wait a second - '' Izuku ($_izuku) started . Bakugo grit his teeth and stepped toward the hovering bug hastily , sending him flying in the direction of his movement . 
`` Daddy ... '' 
Ripping the other out of his own existential crisis , he grabbed the redhead 's wrist , turned forwards and started a brisk back to the tower . He 'd make it back , before bug-boy got into his head and before pretty-boy could escape his . 
`` Come on , lets get you home - '' 
`` No . '' 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) halted . `` You 'll crush his heart - '' 
`` No , '' Shouto ($_shouto) laughed , suddenly burden-less again . `` Da - I mean , father wo n't notice so long as we both uphold our end of the deal . You 're taking me to see those fireworks whether you like it or not . '' He commanded . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt his ($_bakugou) hands itching to explode - much like the throbbing anger in his ($_bakugou) chest . 
"Now lets go." Shouto ($_shouto) stormed off with surprising resolve . Great . He ($_shouto) seemed to have done the exact opposite of what he ($_shouto) 'd been intending to do . 
`` Listen fucktard - you might have my crown and all but if you 're gon na be having mental breakdowns the whole way through - '' 
`` Mental breakdown ? '' Shouto ($_shouto) turned on his ($_shouto) heel sharply , suddenly face to face with Bakugou ($_bakugou) - who may or may not have stood smaller than the other without his ($_shouto) boots - and narrowed his ($_shouto) eyes . `` You ($_shouto) call that , a mental breakdown ? '' 
He ($_shouto) 'd officially lost the ability to breathe . He ($_shouto) was peeved , yes . But he ($_shouto) felt a tingle too , a challenge . A burn within him ($_shouto) that made him ($_shouto) shove his ($_shouto) chest into the others and snarl . But before he ($_shouto) could even begin to speak , the cool voice of the other cast his ($_shouto) mind in ice . 
`` If I have a mental breakdown , you 'd know about it . Believe me , I am the one who knocked you out after all . '' 
Shouto ($_shouto) motioned for him ($_shouto) to follow , before striding off . 
It took at least eight seconds for him ($_shouto) to return to his ($_shouto) brain . And the first thing he ($_shouto) did was groan , grabbing the half n ' half by the shoulder and promptly dragging him ($_shouto) in the opposite direction . Keeping his ($_shouto) head tilted the other way , Bakugou ($_bakugou) acted like he ($_shouto) was n't wearing his ($_shouto) blush as he ($_shouto) grunted in false annoyance . 
`` This way you dumb shit . '' 
`` Bakugou ($_bakugou) , before we stray too far I have some things my father warned me about I 'd appreciate if we avoided . First of all , '' 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) rolled his ($_bakugo) eyes . If he ($_bakugo) wanted a freaking presentation lecture he ($_bakugo) 'd have gone to some college instead . 
`` There are a lot of people who would like to harm me , so if at all possible , public places should be avioded . '' 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) could tell from one glance alone what kind of ' harm ' a lot of people would want to inflict on this_boy ($_izuku) . 
`` Secondly , we should stay in the shadows . That way , less people will be able to see us . '' 
That one , he ($_bakugo) was n't so sure about . Would n't you want more people to be around so more can help if something does go wrong ? 
`` On that note , we should also avoid men with sharp teeth . Not just because they 're potentially dangerous , but because they 're scary as well . '' 
`` Ooh ! I agree with you on that one . '' Izuku ($_izuku) chimed , having emerged beside them yet again . 
As the_boy ($_izuku) continued to drabble on with his ($_izuku) list , Bakugou ($_bakugou) started to frown . It was either the father who was an idiot , the son for believing him ($_izuku) , or both . 
He ($_izuku) eyed the_pure_boy ($_izuku) beside him ($_izuku) , wondering how he ($_izuku) could be so insanely dense . 
If ever he ($_izuku) was going to run into someone intending harm , it would be in dark places out of the public eye . And once they did , nobody would be there to see it or help him ($_izuku) . 
As for the thing about men with sharp teeth - that was just plain fucking judgemental and weird . Teaching your kids to judge others like that , not to mention fear them was weird as heck . 
Besides , Kiri and Tetsu were pretty fucking intimidating physically , but they would never dare to do something like - 
An idea hit him ($_izuku) like a graceful message sent from the clouds above . 
`` You ($_izuku) hungry pretty boy ? '' He ($_izuku) interrupted the rant , admiring the slow way he ($_izuku) had to really think about it before giving his ($_izuku) little nod . 
`` Heh , '' he ($_izuku) chuckled deviously , curving his ($_izuku) arm over the other teen 's shoulders , `` I ($_izuku) know the perfect place . '' 
The Snugly Duckling could be described as a fine assortment of God-sent scumbags and ruffians alike . He ($_izuku) knew a few safe frequenters however , so as long as they went to the right people and the gorgeous teen was seen under his arm , things would be fine . 
They were a few yards away however , when Shouto ($_shouto) defied all of his ($_shouto) expectations and dumbly sprinted towards the place . 
"Hey-! Wait what the fuck ! '' 
It was a calm establishment on the outside , beside a narrow tinkling river and visited by the occasional waddling bird . The sunlight touched downwards on it 's overgrown hedges and messy roof in a way that looked cushiony and soft and comforting . 
A far , far cry from the ironic reality . 
`` I have to make sure father 's not in there first . '' 
"Shouto! You should slow down ! '' Izuku ($_izuku) panicked , flying after his ($_izuku) friend who was surprisingly quick . He ($_izuku) was already there , looking in the windows , opening up the door . 
`` It 's fine . '' 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt miles behind the athletically slim male even at top speed , teeth gritting and frowning in aggravation as the door to the bar slammed shut behind the male . 
He ($_izuku) kept telling himself ($_izuku) he ($_izuku) was n't worried at all , but when his ($_izuku) hands finally reached the door , all he ($_izuku) could think was - 
`` Fuck !! '' 
Then Bakugo ($_bakugo) stops . A cloud drifts over the sunlight , painting the world a drab grey as it dawns on him ($_izuku) . This could be his ($_izuku) chance . If he ($_izuku) ran back to the tower now , he ($_izuku) could find his ($_izuku) crown and leave . Vanish without the dumb teen even knowing what hit him ($_izuku) . It would serve him ($_izuku) right for being too trust worthy . 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) was going back . 
As the clouds cleared in his ($_izuku) mind and body , he ($_izuku) made his ($_izuku) decision . Yet somehow despite this front , the blond found himself ($_izuku) storming into the dingy room against his ($_izuku) throughts with the door to the pub slamming angrily shut behind him ($_izuku) . 
It reeked of man . Booze . Sex and everything else wrong with the world . 
He ($_izuku) barked out this comment , but not a single person turned to look at him ($_izuku) . Everything was in a strange state of unrest . 
Rather than sitting in booths , huddling groups , crowding around gambling games or singing at the bar with alcohol spilling from their cups as their balance dwindled , they were all crowded in one place . 
He ($_izuku) had to push past . Although he ($_izuku) was probably the only one below twenty in the room , he ($_izuku) was used to this lifestyle and slammed through thugs and ruffians twice his ($_izuku) size until finally , he ($_izuku) landed in the centre of the noise . 
No wonder nobody had spared him ($_izuku) a glance . 
And he ($_izuku) could n't blame them . 
Shouto ($_shouto) was an absolute magnet for attention ; a literal rose among the thorns or beam of light in the darkness . The gritty , manly ugliness of the others in the room , with their swelling noses and cracked , crooked yellow teeth only amplified how truly unique and beautiful he ($_izuku) was in contrast . 
The dim lighting did n't diminish this in the slightest , highlighting the tips of his ($_izuku) barely visible yet thick eyelashes and basking him ($_izuku) in a more natural , seductive and soft light as he ($_izuku) sipped from a mug of mysterious content curiously - 
"Don't fucking swallow that!" Bakugou ($_bakugou) hollered , jumping towards the bar the teen leaned on and knocking it out of his ($_bakugou) grip . 
It clanged to the ground , his ($_bakugou) hand remaining in place in shock as if it were still in his ($_bakugou) grip . 
Yellow liquid pooled , the owner arriving with a look of distaste on his ($_bakugou) lips . `` You better be paying for that . '' 
`` Actually , this_nice_man ($_bakugou) offered to . '' 
Nice man . Nice fucking man ?? 
That was when Bakugou ($_bakugou) noticed him ($_bakugou) . In thick hiking boots and a large coat like a lion 's mane , Inasa_Yaoroshi ($_inasa) tipped his ($_inasa) hat with a grin to the owner , leaning his ($_inasa) gargantuan arms over his ($_inasa) companion to place a single note on the table . 
`` Yep , and you can keep the change as a tip too ! '' The_man ($_bakugou) cheered , not once removing his ($_bakugou) eyes from the mismatched boy 's , leaning in so close it made Shouto ($_shouto) appear much smaller . 
He ($_bakugou) wanted him ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) could tell instantly from the look in the_man_'s ($_bakugou) eyes and it appalled him ($_bakugou) . 
`` Hey baldy back the fuck off will you . He ($_bakugou) 's with me . '' 
He ($_bakugou) grabbed Shouto 's shoulders -LRB- they may have been slim but they were firmer than he ($_bakugou) 'd thought -RRB- and pulled him ($_bakugou) to his ($_bakugou) protective side . But Baldy ($_baldy) was n't the only one , as several other men took it ($_baldy) as an opportunity to try and win him ($_bakugou) over with cheap tricks , smiles , drinks and stories . 
He ($_bakugou) knew that in reality they only wanted one thing from the boy . 
The blond could only recoil in horror as the teen tried innocently to accept another drink . 
`` What the fuck is wrong with you half 'n half ? Did n't you consider that shit could be poisoned ! '' 
"Poisoned?" 
"Yes. Poisoned. They probably want to get you unconscious so they can - '' 
`` So they can what Bakugo ? If you do n't answer I will ~ '' Someone from behind him ($_bakugou) hollered as the entire room was lit was half intoxicated chuckles . 
`` But - are n't you the one who brought me here ? Did n't you say it was safe . '' 
Great . Now Bakugou ($_bakugou) could n't point out the fact that it was everything the boy feared in one . It would only make him look like the asshole that he was . Instead of answering , Bakugou ($_bakugou) fixed his ($_bakugou) gaping jaw by turning to the crowd and yelling an unceremonious `` SHUT THE FUCK UP ! '' 
`` Hey Bakugou ($_bakugou) , let him ($_bakugou) mingle with the locals . You brought him ($_bakugou) here so I say you let him ($_bakugou) enjoy it ! '' Inasa ($_inasa) chuckled , ever amiable , inviting himself over to the attractive teen 's side . 
The quiet male nodded in agreement . Clearly , he was excited by the new sights and smells and potential tastes around him . 
`` What do you say , let him stay with me for a bit , I 'll make it worth his time . Besides , you know me , right Bakugou ($_bakugou) ? '' 
He was right . They were n't at all close or anything of sort , but Bakugou ($_bakugou) knew the baldy well enough to know that his ($_bakugou) criminal record did n't make him ($_bakugou) a rapist or kidnapper . 
Judging him ($_bakugou) now would only be hypocritical . And yet , he ($_bakugou) still felt a tight knot in his ($_bakugou) stomach at the idea of leaving his ($_bakugou) discovery alone with the_man ($_bakugou) . Maybe because he ($_bakugou) was bigger , stronger . 
Maybe because he ($_bakugou) made Shouto ($_shouto) look so weak beside him ($_bakugou) and that very same helpless kid had trusted him ($_bakugou) so blindly with the task of protecting him ($_bakugou) . 
Or maybe it was something else entirely . Something less logical , more emotional . 
Maybe it was just simple lovers ' jealousy . 
Shouto ($_shouto) was rushed so quickly when Bakugou ($_bakugou) zoned out that he ($_bakugou) blinked and found himself ($_bakugou) back in the mass of people . His ($_bakugou) eyes met Inasa_'s ($_inasa) briefly in a low voiced agreement to keep him ($_bakugou) safe . 
It was at the back of the crowd that Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt two familiar arms drape around him ($_bakugou) and shake . 
`` Bakubro you ($_bakugou) 're here !! '' 
The two twins yelled obnoxiously into both his ($_bakugou) ears , making him ($_bakugou) cringe and jump back to glare at them . 
`` Shit-fucking damn it ! You bastards did n't get arrested ?! '' He ($_bakugou) exclaimed , recalling their devastated , betrayed expressions as they looked up at him ($_bakugou) from the ditch . The royal guards had been so close by they were practically touching him ($_bakugou) . 
"Nope. We kicked their asses right Kiri ? '' 
`` Hell yeah we did . Do n't mess with these bros ! '' 
Bakugo ($_bakugo) wanted to hit them , but before he ($_bakugo) could , they beat him ($_bakugo) to it . Like they 'd read his ($_bakugo) mind , two solid and painful fists thunked him ($_bakugo) on the head , making his ($_bakugo) brain ache from a pain there he ($_bakugo) had n't yet noticed til now . 
`` OW ! '' He ($_bakugo) screeched . `` Fuck was that for !? '' 
`` I do n't know , for leaving us for dead ? '' Bakugo_'s ($_bakugo) mouth snapped open to defend himself ($_bakugo) , but the two boys only laughed loudly at him ($_bakugo) , pinching their grip around him ($_bakugo) tighter in a way that was almost affectionate . Ever loving , ever forgiving bastards . 
He ($_bakugo) ended up enable to escape their grasp , only grumbling a reluctant and miserable `` For fucks sake . '' 
Tenya ($_tenya) was certain he ($_bakugo) 'd heard a sound just now . 
Like the motion of a person after finally climbing down the cliff , only to find nought at all . He ($_bakugo) was n't aware of the secret opening , not even close as he ($_bakugo) followed the explosive , unnatural scent into a wall of grass and squinted in defeat . 
After finding no other path , he ($_bakugo) 'd journeyed a little further out , back towards the kingdom . 
He ($_bakugo) knew he ($_bakugo) was being too persistent , as all the accompanying guards were no where to be seen . 
The last thing he ($_bakugo) expected to see when he ($_bakugo) jumped out to pounce on the source of the rustling , was the austere blue glare of the king looking down on him ($_bakugo) . 
`` Ah ha-ah ?! K-King Enji ! '' He ($_bakugo) jolted from attack mode into a high up salute , the man raising one dark eyebrow in a fashion that was so clearly an expression associated with him ($_bakugo) that it could n't be a criminal impersonator using transforming spell . 
`` What are you ($_bakugo) doing out here ? '' He ($_bakugo) gasped , eyes incredulous as he ($_bakugo) glanced from the royal armour , insignia and clothing , confirming twice that it was indeed the correct man . 
`` I could ask you the same thing ! '' The_man ($_bakugou) snapped coldly , yanking the rains of his ($_bakugou) horse back . His ($_bakugou) eyes kept darting , like he ($_bakugou) was eager to get out . Now though , they had decided only to scrutinise Iida who felt their roles reverse as he ($_bakugou) stuttered and felt heat on his ($_bakugou) face . 
`` We - I 'm following the trail of the crown jewel theif . '' 
The words had slipped out before he ($_bakugou) had a chance to correct them . The_King ($_the) had been out when the robbery had occurred , and now Tenya_Iida ($_tenya) had accidentally volunteered himself ($_tenya) to be the bearer of bad news in the most insensitive way he ($_bakugou) could imagine . 
He ($_bakugou) grit his ($_bakugou) teeth , bit his ($_bakugou) cheek , waited for the almost certain wrath and fury of the_notorious_hell-flame_King ($_the) . 
The_man ($_bakugou) only huffed out a puff of red . `` Is that so ? I trust you can continue the search successfully ? '' 
`` Yes ($_yes) Yes_sir ($_yes) ! '' 
`` I have business to attend to . Be gone-"
`` Sir ($_sir) I do n't think you understand , it ($_sir) is n't just any crown that 's gone missing , it ($_sir) 's the one belonging to your son - '' 
`` I understand very well , TENYA . '' He snarled . 
`` Oh - Your - High - Sir I just thought you might be s-s - no - angrier - '' 
"Get to work. NOW." 
Great . Tenya ($_tenya) internally cringed at the fact that the_King ($_the) had not been angry with him ($_tenya) until he ($_tenya) 'd slipped up and brought it on himself ($_tenya) . 
`` Yes ($_yes) Yes_sir ($_yes) ! '' He ($_tenya) snapped before darting off to find another trail . 
After three seconds , the_King ($_the) himself ($_tenya) bolted off on his ($_tenya) horse into the hidden wall , not caring to make the walk again or take the time to tie the animal . He ($_tenya) was sure it was just his ($_tenya) own paranoia , but it would be foolish not to check on his ($_tenya) own tower . 
Keeping his ($_tenya) head low , he ($_tenya) landed in the clearing , pushing past the useless decorations of nature and trampling the necks of flowers in his ($_tenya) way . 
The rope that lifted him ($_tenya) up was gone . Almost like somebody had tried to get in but he ($_tenya) son had lifted it . No . The item was n't even visible at the top . 
`` SHOUTO ($_shouto) ! '' He ($_tenya) called , `` Let down the rope ! '' 
He ($_tenya) waited . 
It was something he ($_tenya) rarely did but with his ($_tenya) son there was an exception . 
Nothing happened . 
Not a stir . 
`` SHOUTO ($_shouto) !! '' 
To be ignored was something else entirely . He ($_tenya) knew even his ($_tenya) disobedient brat would n't dare . 
His ($_tenya) boot thudded agaisnt the wall . 
Frantically thinking , the boy could be asleep , the boy could be in the shower - 
Of course he ($_tenya) was n't , he ($_tenya) had just had one while he ($_tenya) was there . 
Enough waiting . 
He ($_tenya) circled the tower , shoving his ($_tenya) entire brute weight into a particular area until a single brick dived off . 
Like digging his ($_tenya) fingers into a wound , he ($_tenya) ripped into the opening , tearing bricks and stones apart like the adhesive was a mere millimetre thick . A rough shape resembling an arch doorway had appeared when he ($_tenya) shoved past the remaining bricks with his ($_tenya) body and bolted up the stairs . 
If they boy was only asleep he ($_tenya) would n't be for long . He ($_tenya) was going to get what he ($_tenya) deserved . 
Finally slamming the hidden floor tile away . He ($_tenya) landed in the room only to stop and blink at the shocking extent at which it was dark . 
Cold , even . 
`` Shouto ... '' He ($_tenya) mouthed , mournfully , angrily , he ($_tenya) was n't sure . 
For all he ($_tenya) knew his ($_tenya) son could have been kidnapped . But that thought would 've had more strength before their argument about leaving . 
Rage trickled through his ($_tenya) blood stream . Before he ($_tenya) knew it , flames pounced from his ($_tenya) skin into every candle , alighting the fireplace until the room took on a red glow . 
It was a glow of loneliness , before his ($_tenya) son was there to take the time to fashion blue lanterns and stained glasses . It was the red gleam of days where he ($_tenya) and his ($_tenya) wife would hide away in this tower to be alone before their marriage was accepted . Before she turned into a witch deserving of death . 
That 's when a gleam caught his eye . It was a gleam he would remember for the rest of his life . One that was familiar , one that he had ordered to be made himself , but had somehow transported itself from one of his homes to the other . 
It was the crown of the Prince . The crown of his son that had carried itself to Shouto by fate , destiny , or maybe just a petty criminal . 
His grip clenched around it , hoping to every God out there for the sake of the boy himself that Shouto did not know .
