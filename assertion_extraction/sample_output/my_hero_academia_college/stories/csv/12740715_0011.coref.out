12740715,11,1,"The ground shaking has only intensified , and it s this time that Bakugou ($_bakugou) is disturbed by it at all . 
"
12740715,11,2,"They weren t given a rest this time . The earth shakes and shakes and shakes , the ground cracking and splitting up the group . It s the most intense challenge yet and Bakugou ($_bakugou) knows it , curses himself ($_bakugou) for letting his ($_bakugou) guard down at all . People are being tossed around like ragdolls , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) is only getting by because he ($_bakugou) s clinging to the ground as tight as he ($_bakugou) can . His ($_bakugou) eyes scan the place for any sign of those stupid gloves , but he ($_bakugou) can t see anything but the rest of the Company . 
"
12740715,11,3,"Frustrated , he ($_bakugou) shouts , but his ($_bakugou) voice is drowned out by the Earth , which answers to him ($_bakugou) by splitting his ($_bakugou) piece of rock in half and nearly causing him ($_bakugou) to fall . Fuck this shitty tower and its omnipotent fucking challenges that fucking sabotage all of the fucking challengers . If he ($_bakugou) could , he ($_bakugou) d punch whoever made the tower right in the face , but he ($_bakugou) s a little busy trying to not die at the moment . 
"
12740715,11,4,"Goddammit ($_goddammit) ! He ($_bakugou) curses , trying to stand up only to have another powerful tremor shake the ground that forces him ($_bakugou) back into a flat position . His ($_bakugou) eyes dart around for anything he ($_bakugou) can use to his ($_bakugou) advantage , but there s nothing , no solid way to form a plan or anything . It pisses him ($_bakugou) off . 
"
12740715,11,5,"He ($_bakugou) struggles to get up again , slowly , but there s no use . It almost feels like the ground is forcing him ($_bakugou) back down every time he ($_bakugou) tries to stand . He ($_bakugou) feels useless , and that makes him ($_bakugou) fucking mad . He ($_bakugou) s not useless , he ($_bakugou) ll show this challenge just who s in charge here . He ($_bakugou) looks to his ($_bakugou) left and - 
"
12740715,11,6,"Deku ($_deku) looks like he ($_bakugou) s gon na fall . 
"
12740715,11,7,"Goddammit ($_goddammit) . 
"
12740715,11,8,"Time freezes . It doesn t really freeze , but that s what it feels like to Bakugou as he ($_bakugou) watched his ($_bakugou) former friend topple over the edge of one of the bigger cracks . A part of him ($_bakugou) that he ($_bakugou) s too disgusted with to even acknowledge tells him ($_bakugou) to just let Deku ($_deku) die and take all the glory , but he ($_bakugou) s not that kind of person . Sure , he ($_bakugou) s pissed at Deku ($_deku) for being the_Bearer ($_the) , but he ($_bakugou) knows when to not let his ($_bakugou) grudge get in the way of things . And , now , it s either his ($_bakugou) grudge or the rest of the world . 
"
12740715,11,9,"With adrenaline pumping through his ($_bakugou) veins , he ($_bakugou) gets up and launches himself ($_bakugou) at Deku ($_deku) , momentarily free of the tremors as he ($_bakugou) collides with the_Bearer ($_the) and pushes him ($_bakugou) back onto the ground . Bakugou himself ($_bakugou) reaches for the edge , and he ($_bakugou) just barely nicks it with the tips of his ($_bakugou) fingers before he ($_bakugou) realizes that , fuck , he ($_bakugou) s going to die and it s all because of shitty Deku ($_deku) . The last of the company he ($_bakugou) sees is , in fact , the same person he ($_bakugou) s just saved , staring down at him ($_bakugou) with an incredulous expression . 
"
12740715,11,10,"He ($_bakugou) falls for what seems like forever . It s enough for him ($_bakugou) to go through a rollercoaster of emotions , from shocked to angry to sad to resigned . Right. He ($_bakugou) s going to die in this stupid crack in the ground . 
"
12740715,11,11,"There s a point where he ($_bakugou) just stops . He ($_bakugou) doesn t hit the ground , or anything , though . He ($_bakugou) just stops for a moment and then keeps falling for a split second before coming in contact with the ground . It makes him ($_bakugou) grunt , and that alone echoes throughout the cave system he ($_bakugou) s just landed in . 
"
12740715,11,12,"He ($_bakugou) pushes himself ($_bakugou) off of the ground and looks around , giving his ($_bakugou) eyes a minute to adjust to the dark . Maybe this is what was supposed to happen , he ($_bakugou) thinks , and a smirk takes over his ($_bakugou) face . Of course it s what s supposed to happen , because he ($_bakugou) s the challenger . Obviously he ($_bakugou) had to get separated from the group . 
"
12740715,11,13,"Once he ($_bakugou) s back on his ($_bakugou) feet he ($_bakugou) starts walking aimlessly . The tremors haven t gone completely , but they re still faint , as if they were originating at the surface , which was fucking weird because that s not how earthquakes work . But , then again , everything in this tower is weird , so he ($_bakugou) keeps walking without thinking of it too much . 
"
12740715,11,14,"It gets to a point where the tremors have died down completely , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) thinks he ($_bakugou) s close . Which is just as well , cause he ($_bakugou) s gon na show this group just how much he ($_bakugou) can kick ass at this . There s a light coming from the cave , just around the corner , and Bakugou sprints towards it . As he ($_bakugou) expects , there are the gloves , suspended in the middle of a round area of the cave . Triumphantly , he ($_bakugou) walks right up and shoves them onto his ($_bakugou) hands . 
"
12740715,11,15,"He ($_bakugou) s probably much too cocky . The cave-in begins as soon as he ($_bakugou) has the gloves fully on , but he ($_bakugou) s prepared . He ($_bakugou) uses his ($_bakugou) anger at this fucking challenge to keep all the rubble away from him ($_bakugou) and when he ($_bakugou) s done with that , he ($_bakugou) sees what the purpose of this was . A large hole has opened up in the ceiling . He ($_bakugou) grins , touches his ($_bakugou) hand to the ground , and braces himself ($_bakugou) . 
"
12740715,11,16,"The ground underneath him ($_bakugou) shoots up rapidly , bringing him ($_bakugou) up like an elevator . He ($_bakugou) notes that there are no longer any tremors happening . That s just as well , since the earth is moving according to his ($_bakugou) will now . He ($_bakugou) ends up at the surface and there s cheering , which ruins the moment . 
"
12740715,11,17,"They re back in the tower again and he ($_bakugou) s being surrounded by his ($_bakugou) group who tell him ($_bakugou) that was fucking awesome , and it s great and all , he ($_bakugou) deserves this kind of recognition for being a badass , but also - 
"
12740715,11,18,"He ($_bakugou) makes eye contact with Deku ($_deku) . 
"
12740715,11,19,"The_shorter_man ($_bakugou) gives him ($_bakugou) a bright smile and it s disgusting , so Bakugou ($_bakugou) scowls and looks away , lets himself ($_bakugou) get lost in pointless conversation again . Except he ($_bakugou) s not really listening , he ($_bakugou) s thinking about what he ($_bakugou) did . He ($_bakugou) doesn t regret it , sure , but he ($_bakugou) s not going to say he ($_bakugou) s happy about the fact that it was Deku of all people . A part of him ($_bakugou) , though , a selfish part of him ($_bakugou) feels satisfied that Deku ($_deku) had to rely on him ($_bakugou) to survive . 
"
12740715,11,20,"The thought brings a twisted scowl to his ($_bakugou) face . He ($_bakugou) s not so selfish that he ($_bakugou) d saved Deku ($_deku) s life just for his ($_bakugou) own satisfaction . He ($_bakugou) d saved Deku ($_deku) because he ($_bakugou) had to , because the world was riding on that stupid guy s survival and there was nothing he ($_bakugou) could do to change that . 
"
12740715,11,21,"You re lying to yourself , says a little traitorous voice in his ($_bakugou) head . You d have done it regardless of whether or not he ($_bakugou) was the_Bearer ($_the) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) ignores this voice even though it s his ($_bakugou) own and it s right . Just because it s the truth doesn t mean it s nice to think about . 
"
12740715,11,22,"The group stops to take a rest and Bakugou ($_bakugou) sits against a wall on his ($_bakugou) own , intending to sort out some things in his ($_bakugou) mind in silence . His ($_bakugou) plans are rudely interrupted by a shortie in a dark cloak . 
"
12740715,11,23,"Before Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) can even speak , Bakugou ($_bakugou) asks , What the fuck do you want ? He ($_bakugou) s already annoyed enough as it is , and this isn t helping . 
"
12740715,11,24,"Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) bows his ($_tokoyami) head down . I wanted to tell you that I think what you did was very noble . I could not have . He ($_bakugou) s about to respond with his ($_bakugou) usual string of curses and exclamations for him ($_bakugou) to go away , but something stops him ($_bakugou) . Maybe it s the tone of Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) s voice or the way he ($_bakugou) worded that , but there s just one thing that won t let him ($_bakugou) curse the bird-brain out . We were all worried . 
"
12740715,11,25,"He ($_bakugou) manages a quiet , Shut the fuck up . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) complies . The two sit next to eachother in silence until there are calls for everyone to get up and get moving to the next task . 
"
12740715,11,26,"The bard begins yet another story to entertain the wary minds of the group he s helped form .
