14203527,1,1,"It was raining a lot during the weekdays . Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t have much work in these conditions , nobody went out when the ground was so soggy and slippery . At least not in this town . He spent a lot of time at the temporary home , and so did Kirishima ($_kirishima) . The_dragon ($_the) was being very quiet the past few days , he had barely looked at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
"
14203527,1,2,"He looked at Kirishima who was sitting at an armchair he pushed in front of the window . The_dragon ($_the) sat there without speaking , watching as water trailed down the glass . Bakugou ($_bakugou) figured that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a little down because of the weather . He ($_bakugou) was very easily swayed . The rain made people sad sometimes , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was just a little sad . 
"
14203527,1,3,"On Wednesday , after three days of not talking to Bakugou , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was being uncharacteristically mean . Bakugou ($_bakugou) watched with careful eyes as the_dragon ($_the) was being picky with his ($_bakugou) food , mumbling under his ($_bakugou) breath that he ($_bakugou) didn t want to eat what he ($_bakugou) was given . Bakugou ($_bakugou) had never seen Kirishima ($_kirishima) complain about food . He ($_bakugou) s seen him ($_bakugou) eat half a desk before . Bakugou ($_bakugou) cleared his ($_bakugou) throat , pushing Kirishima ($_kirishima) s plate closer to him ($_bakugou) . 
"
14203527,1,4,"Why the hell are you suddenly picky ? Eat. Bakugou ($_bakugou) mumbled , tipping his ($_bakugou) head back to drink his ($_bakugou) black coffee . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rolled his ($_kirishima) eyes , pushing the plate harsher than was necessary and leaning back in his ($_kirishima) seat . 
"
14203527,1,5,"I just don t want to eat this shit . Kirishima ($_kirishima) growled lowly . Bakugou ($_bakugou) recoiled slightly , a words processed in his ($_bakugou) head , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tone slapped him ($_bakugou) across the face . Kirishima_Eijirou ($_eijirou) was talking back to him ($_bakugou) . Kirishima_Eijirou ($_eijirou) was swearing at him ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) quirked an eyebrow as he ($_bakugou) stared down the_dragon ($_the) . 
"
14203527,1,6,"The fuck did you say ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) usually wouldn t curse so much at Kirishima ($_kirishima) , because if he ($_bakugou) did the_dragon ($_the) would burst into tears and whine about it ($_the) . Not today . Kirishima ($_kirishima) glared at Bakugou ($_bakugou) , he ($_kirishima) s never done that in his ($_kirishima) whole life , and the_dragon ($_the) smirked at the sight of Bakugou ($_bakugou) grimacing . 
"
14203527,1,7,"I m sick of this shit . Kirishima ($_kirishima) replied , as crisply as he ($_kirishima) could . Bakugou ($_bakugou) gritted his ($_bakugou) teeth and squared his ($_bakugou) shoulders a bit . The dragon didn t bat an eye as his ($_bakugou) owner leaned over the table towards him ($_bakugou) and grabbed at the collar of his ($_bakugou) shirt . 
"
14203527,1,8,"You re being an asshole . Bakugou ($_bakugou) muttered , grip tightening when the dragon tilted his ($_bakugou) head back just slightly . He ($_bakugou) s never seen a shiteating grin on Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Only in a nightmare . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s stomach curled , and he ($_bakugou) shakily inhaled . 
"
14203527,1,9,"I learned from the best . Kirishima ($_kirishima) snapped , grin getting wider when Bakugou ($_bakugou) pushed him ($_bakugou) back and slammed a fist onto a counter . 
"
14203527,1,10,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) what the fuck , Bakugou ($_bakugou) dragged a hand over his ($_bakugou) face and shook his ($_bakugou) head . I don t want to fucking look at you right now . He ($_bakugou) only looked up as the_dragon ($_the) began shuffling away , and their eyes met when Kirishima ($_kirishima) neared a front door . 
"
14203527,1,11,"Have fun playing pretend god with no followers , Kirishima ($_kirishima) growled , grabbing at a doorknob and watching as Bakugou ($_bakugou) s lips twitched as if he ($_bakugou) was going to speak . What? Going to forbid me from leaving this house ? You re not my god . 
"
14203527,1,12,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) slammed a door shut as he ($_kirishima) left . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was left by the one person he ($_kirishima) thought would be there forever . He ($_kirishima) sat down on the floor silently , thinking . He ($_kirishima) left and he ($_kirishima) just let him ($_kirishima) . 
"
14203527,1,13,"Friday night . Kirishima hasn t come back . Bakugou ($_bakugou) can t eat , can t sleep , can t take care of himself because he feels too guilty too . He drove him away . 
"
14203527,1,14,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) ended up going through with his ($_bakugou) job . He ($_bakugou) almost completely ruined it . He ($_bakugou) zoned out halfway through and started blaming himself ($_bakugou) for things that hadn t happened yet . If Kirishima ($_kirishima) was hurt somewhere , it was his ($_bakugou) fault . If Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt betrayed Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t follow him ($_bakugou) , it was his ($_bakugou) fault . If Kirishima ($_kirishima) wasn t coming back , Bakugou ($_bakugou) would never forgive himself ($_bakugou) . 
"
14203527,1,15,"When he ($_bakugou) received payment for his ($_bakugou) job , he ($_bakugou) didn t have energy to apologize or barter for more . He ($_bakugou) didn t deserve what he ($_bakugou) d gotten anyways . He ($_bakugou) didn t deserve to be paid after he ($_bakugou) drove away his ($_bakugou) only friend , his ($_bakugou) only companion , the only person he ($_bakugou) s ever loved since the tragedy with his ($_bakugou) family . He ($_bakugou) let him ($_bakugou) get away . 
"
14203527,1,16,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) lay quietly in his ($_bakugou) bed . Rain pounded on the roof , reminding him ($_bakugou) of the silence and emptiness of the house . It was cold . His ($_bakugou) room seemed bigger , lonelier . 
"
14203527,1,17,"He ($_bakugou) stood up from his ($_bakugou) bed , looking through the window longingly and bit at his ($_bakugou) bottom lip . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was out there somewhere . Bakugou ($_bakugou) wanted to bring him ($_bakugou) home . He ($_bakugou) had to . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was out there , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) loved him ($_bakugou) too much to not do anything . 
"
14203527,1,18,"Bakugou didn t have much energy . But he ($_bakugou) tried his ($_bakugou) hardest for Kirishima ($_kirishima) . He ($_bakugou) ran out into the town . He ($_bakugou) didn t realize then but he ($_bakugou) left the door unlocked and he ($_bakugou) went out without a jacket . Even though he ($_bakugou) had his ($_bakugou) cape on , his ($_bakugou) chest was still bare and his ($_bakugou) hair was soaked in seconds . The fur on his ($_bakugou) cape dragged him ($_bakugou) down as he ($_bakugou) ran , but he ($_bakugou) didn t put the pieces together . 
"
14203527,1,19,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) blamed himself ($_bakugou) for the lethargy , he ($_bakugou) blamed himself ($_bakugou) for taking so long , he ($_bakugou) blamed himself ($_bakugou) for not being able to see he ($_bakugou) was hurting Kirishima ($_kirishima) . The_way_Kirishima ($_the) spoke to him ($_bakugou) , it ($_the) was obvious he ($_bakugou) was bottling up his ($_bakugou) feelings . The dragon didn t want to be with Bakugou ($_bakugou) anymore . Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t even give him ($_bakugou) a chance to express himself ($_bakugou) until the moment he ($_bakugou) left . 
"
14203527,1,20,"The rain running under Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes was warm . As his ($_bakugou) vision got blurrier as he ($_bakugou) ran , he ($_bakugou) wiped at his ($_bakugou) face with his ($_bakugou) wrist . His ($_bakugou) skin was cold . His ($_bakugou) face was getting hotter . His ($_bakugou) head was hurting too . It wasn t rain , he ($_bakugou) knew it wasn t . But it wasn t about him ($_bakugou) . It wasn t about the splitting pain he ($_bakugou) felt close to his ($_bakugou) heart . 
"
14203527,1,21,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped in the forest after looking for almost fifty minutes . The cold rain was chilling him ($_bakugou) to the bone . He ($_bakugou) shook with every step he ($_bakugou) took , and he ($_bakugou) cursed at himself ($_bakugou) for being so stupid . How could he ($_bakugou) find Kirishima ($_kirishima) if he ($_bakugou) was dead from hypothermia ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) was wringing out his ($_bakugou) cape when something in his ($_bakugou) chest began to throb . He ($_bakugou) gasped gently , pressing his ($_bakugou) hand to his ($_bakugou) skin . 
"
14203527,1,22,"His ($_bakugou) soul . Not just his ($_bakugou) soul , but Kirishima s soul . He ($_bakugou) must be getting closer . Bakugou ($_bakugou) began to run again , he ($_bakugou) slipped easily and grabbed onto a branch . His ($_bakugou) head was pounding uneasily and he ($_bakugou) saw dots when he ($_bakugou) narrowed his ($_bakugou) eyes . He ($_bakugou) clearly was not well . But he ($_bakugou) was too close to give up . 
"
14203527,1,23,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) ran , following the deep pain in his ($_bakugou) flesh . He ($_bakugou) was far into the forest at this point , almost at the edge . When he ($_bakugou) did reach the edge , he ($_bakugou) stared at the raging river splashing water all around . He ($_bakugou) opened his ($_bakugou) mouth and yelled for Kirishima ($_kirishima) . His ($_bakugou) voice was barely heard above the water . He ($_bakugou) cupped his ($_bakugou) mouth his ($_bakugou) hands and tried again . So loud that his ($_bakugou) voice cracked and his ($_bakugou) throat hurt . 
"
14203527,1,24,"No reply . Bakugou ($_bakugou) leaned against the nearest thing he ($_bakugou) could find , a large boulder . His ($_bakugou) skin was irritated from the cold , quick bullets of rain . His ($_bakugou) body shook almost violently at this point . Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed at the rock , he ($_bakugou) couldn t feel his ($_bakugou) fingers very well . He ($_bakugou) laughed breathlessly , it was a bad idea . He ($_bakugou) couldn t breathe very well in the first place . 
"
14203527,1,25,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked around slowly , mind spinning and eyes barely opening . There was an opening a few feet above him ($_bakugou) , upon a ridge was an opening in the earth . Almost like a cave . If he ($_bakugou) was going to die , at least he ($_bakugou) could die out of the rain . 
"
14203527,1,26,"It took him ($_bakugou) ten minutes to get up . He ($_bakugou) wanted to laugh again . If he ($_bakugou) was healthy , it wouldn t have taken him ($_bakugou) more than two . He ($_bakugou) couldn t see , he ($_bakugou) couldn t breathe , and sometimes he ($_bakugou) d just forget what he ($_bakugou) was doing altogether . Hauling himself ($_bakugou) into the opening in the earth , he ($_bakugou) stumbled forward onto the ground and tried to catch his ($_bakugou) breath . 
"
14203527,1,27,"He ($_bakugou) scrunched up his ($_bakugou) hand slowly , trying to salvage any warmth he ($_bakugou) had left in him ($_bakugou) . Something made his ($_bakugou) skin tingle , and then his ($_bakugou) ears wake up . Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked down , blinking as quickly as he ($_bakugou) could . He ($_bakugou) shifted so his ($_bakugou) shadow didn t cover the pale light from outside . 
"
14203527,1,28,"It was dry . The harder he ($_bakugou) looked the more it looked like scales . Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned it in his ($_bakugou) palm quietly . Skin ? He ($_bakugou) put it down , and wiped his ($_bakugou) hand on his ($_bakugou) soaked cape . 
"
14203527,1,29,"Hello? Bakugou ($_bakugou) croaked , listening to his ($_bakugou) voice bounce off the walls and come back to him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) stood up , making his ($_bakugou) way further into the cave . It was slowly getting warmer . 
"
14203527,1,30,"Maybe he ($_bakugou) was making it up because he ($_bakugou) didn t want to die like this . Bakugou ($_bakugou) felt his ($_bakugou) chest twitch , he ($_bakugou) looked over his ($_bakugou) shoulder into the darkness . He ($_bakugou) was probably imagining it . He ($_bakugou) couldn t feel his ($_bakugou) body , and so he ($_bakugou) was compensating with his ($_bakugou) soul . 
"
14203527,1,31,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) shuffled deeper into the cave , and his ($_bakugou) hands felt like hands again . He ($_bakugou) whispered under his ($_bakugou) breath how it was a miracle . Bakugou ($_bakugou) wiggles his ($_bakugou) fingers slowly while looking down at them . He ($_bakugou) realized too late that he ($_bakugou) could see his ($_bakugou) fingers in a pitch black cave . 
"
14203527,1,32,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked up quickly , disorienting himself ($_bakugou) as he ($_bakugou) fell over at the sight of two large eyes staring at his ($_bakugou) through the darkness . He ($_bakugou) grunted , clothes making a wet noise when he ($_bakugou) tried to sit up again . Bakugou ($_bakugou) looked into these eyes , his ($_bakugou) shoulders fell and he ($_bakugou) swallowed the lump in his ($_bakugou) throat . 
"
14203527,1,33,"E. . Eijirou ... Bakugou ($_bakugou) called out to the dragon , shutting one eye when he ($_bakugou) let out a giant puff of fire . He ($_bakugou) felt the warmth around him ($_bakugou) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) took half a step closer . Why , He ($_bakugou) paused when he ($_bakugou) noticed the piles of skin scattered around the dragon . You re shedding ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) raised an eyebrow , about to call out again when the dragon abandoned him ($_bakugou) in the dark cave . 
"
14203527,1,34,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) dragged his ($_bakugou) hand over his ($_bakugou) face , at this point he ($_bakugou) was crying in shock . Then he ($_bakugou) got even more shocked when a loud crash echoed through the cave . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was back , he ($_bakugou) brought logs with him ($_bakugou) , dry logs he ($_bakugou) got from who knows where . He ($_bakugou) threw them into a pile , and spat fire into the middle of them . The dragon then set a log down beside the fire , he ($_bakugou) looked at Bakugou ($_bakugou) and gently tapped his ($_bakugou) feet on the ground . 
"
14203527,1,35,"He ($_bakugou) was still his ($_bakugou) Kirishima . Bakugou ($_bakugou) smiled softly , he ($_bakugou) wiped his ($_bakugou) eyes and tried to pretend it was rainwater . He ($_bakugou) certainly wasn t fooling his ($_bakugou) ever faithful dragon . Bakugou ($_bakugou) sat down o the log , leaning back a bit . Kirishima ($_kirishima) laid on the ground behind him ($_bakugou) , purring loudly when Bakugou ($_bakugou) leaned back on him ($_bakugou) . 
"
14203527,1,36,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) was warm again . So warm in fact he ($_bakugou) forgot he ($_bakugou) was in an earth cave with his ($_bakugou) moulting dragon that he ($_bakugou) passed out then and there . 
"
14203527,1,37,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) was walking down the hallway of his ($_bakugou) childhood home . Just a few more steps and he ($_bakugou) d get to his ($_bakugou) parents bedroom . He ($_bakugou) could tell them all about how he ($_bakugou) d gone into town and bought bread with his ($_bakugou) younger sister . He ($_bakugou) walked eagerly . The door didn t get any closer . Bakugou ($_bakugou) began running . The door didn t get any closer . He ($_bakugou) yelled , no sound came out . Bakugou ($_bakugou) heard footsteps behind him ($_bakugou) , but no matter how hard he ($_bakugou) tried to turn his ($_bakugou) head , he ($_bakugou) couldn t see . Bakugou ($_bakugou) tried to yell again , and again . But he ($_bakugou) couldn t do anything but blindly run . 
"
14203527,1,38,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) awoke with a strained cry . His ($_bakugou) eyes went wide and he ($_bakugou) couldn t adjust to the lack of light quick enough . He ($_bakugou) thrashed around weakly , sat up and stared into the darkness . He ($_bakugou) couldn t see , he ($_bakugou) couldn t breathe . Bakugou ($_bakugou) took deep breaths , probably too deep because he ($_bakugou) choked on one of them and weakly cried out once more . 
"
14203527,1,39,"Katsuki , Kirishima s gentle voice came from behind him ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) went to turn around and look at him ($_bakugou) , but the dragon wrapped his ($_bakugou) arms around his ($_bakugou) chest and pulled him ($_bakugou) close to him ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed onto his ($_bakugou) arms tightly , he ($_bakugou) nodded quickly and pressed his ($_bakugou) back into Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest . I ve got you . Kirishima ($_kirishima) whispered , nuzzling his ($_kirishima) nose against his ($_kirishima) ear . 
"
14203527,1,40,"You re here . Bakugou ($_bakugou) whispered , voice breaking . He ($_bakugou) tried to pull the dragon closer . Kirishima ($_kirishima) fell forward a bit , but he ($_bakugou) understood . He ($_bakugou) held onto Bakugou ($_bakugou) as he ($_bakugou) shifted so he ($_bakugou) was sitting next to him ($_bakugou) instead . The dragon kissed at Bakugou ($_bakugou) s cheek , only stopping when Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned to look at him ($_bakugou) . Their noses brushed , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked into Bakugou s sad eyes . 
"
14203527,1,41,"Forever and always. Kirishima ($_kirishima) spoke , voice shaking just in the slightest . Bakugou ($_bakugou) let the words warm his ($_bakugou) skin even further . He ($_bakugou) nodded his ($_bakugou) head , and kissed Kirishima ($_kirishima) slow and gentle . Bakugou ($_bakugou) cupped Kirishima ($_kirishima) s face in his ($_bakugou) hands , his ($_bakugou) palms felt comfortably warm where they pressed against his ($_bakugou) skin . Kirishima ($_kirishima) dragged his ($_kirishima) fingers over Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulders , they warmed his ($_kirishima) body in a early summer morning kind of way . 
"
14203527,1,42,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) pulled away , eyes still closed and hands still holding Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
"
14203527,1,43,"Why ve you been hiding this from me for so long ? After all these years you d think we have no secrets . Bakugou ($_bakugou) whispered , letting his ($_bakugou) hands drift down to take Kirishima ($_kirishima) s and hold them . You ve never exactly snapped at me before either . He ($_bakugou) looked into Kirishima s half lidded eyes . 
"
14203527,1,44,"I. . . was nervous. No I was embarrassed . I don t really want you to see me throwing temper tantrums and shedding my skin . Kirishima ($_kirishima) huffed slowly , gasping slightly when Bakugou ($_bakugou) kissed him again , a little firmer this time . 
"
14203527,1,45,"I want to see every part of you . I don t want there to be secrets Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) intertwined his ($_bakugou) fingers with the dragon . Secrets are just the beginning of when things start to fall apart . He ($_bakugou) murmured , eyes watching Kirishima ($_kirishima) s teeth nibble at his ($_bakugou) bottom lip anxiously . 
"
14203527,1,46,"Well then , do you know that I lov - 
"
14203527,1,47,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) kissed him again . It caught him by such surprise that the dragon s back pressed to the ground and Bakugou ($_bakugou) almost perfectly landed on top of him . Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked up at Bakugou ($_bakugou) , maybe he was imagining it ($_kirishima) but he swore he saw a light like a halo around his head . 
"
14203527,1,48,"I do know . Because I do too . 
"
14203527,1,49,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) smiled brightly , all teeth and giddiness . Bakugou ($_bakugou) laid down beside him , and they stared up at the earth around them . Their hands laid connected on Bakugou ($_bakugou) s chest , just above his ($_bakugou) heart . Kirishima couldn t stop smiling , and although he ($_bakugou) couldn t see it , Bakugou ($_bakugou) didn t either .
