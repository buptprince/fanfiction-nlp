13819428,2,1,"Kirishima_Eijirou ($_eijirou) lived a nice and peaceful life for a while . He ($_eijirou) was happy living in the small village with his ($_eijirou) parents and fellow villagers . He ($_eijirou) was one of the best fighters in their domain and had always dreamed of travelling outside of his ($_eijirou) mountain home , but knew the risks of that , and so , instead protected his ($_eijirou) mountain domain with others of his ($_eijirou) kind . The northern mountains had many rumors about it , but only one was true . It was the home to the mystical dragon shifters . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was proud to be a dragon shifter , a red dragon at that . He ($_eijirou) never let his ($_eijirou) pride get the better of him ($_eijirou) was praised as going to be a great leader when he ($_eijirou) gets older . But then that fateful day came and changed everything . 
"
13819428,2,2,"The_day ($_the) started out normally enough . Wake up , take a lava bath , get dressed and eat breakfast . Eijirou ($_eijirou) was feeling happier than usual today , because he ($_eijirou) was going out on his ($_eijirou) first hunting trip with some other boys from the village . This ($_eijirou) was technically a right of passage in the village . They never killed humans , seeing as they were humans themselves . No , this right of passage was to hunt an animal that could be used to serve in a feast for the whole village . If more than one person passed , or even if only one person passed , they would become an_Elder_Guardian ($_elder) . Being an_Elder_guardian ($_elder) is the biggest honour any dragon shifter can receive . It was a blessing from the dragons of old , granting powers to the guardian , based on what type of dragon they hailed from . Anyway , Kirishima ($_kirishima) quickly ate his ($_kirishima) breakfast , grabbed his ($_kirishima) two short swords and kissed his ($_kirishima) parents goodbye before running off towards the edge of the village to meet with his ($_kirishima) hunting group . 
"
13819428,2,3,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) ! You made it ! We were getting worried you wouldn t show up ! Goro_Fusanosuke ($_goro) exclaimed . Goro ($_goro) hailed from the Brown Dragon line , but was a great friend to Kirishima . 
"
13819428,2,4,"As if I would miss this ! Let s hope we all pass ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) exclaimed to the rest of the group . The boys and girls of the group all cheered in unison . The guardian that was taking them on their right of passage exam laughed at their antics and called them over . 
"
13819428,2,5,"I m sure you all will do great and please your ancestors . They said and lead the group out of the village and into the forest below the outermost mountains . 
"
13819428,2,6,"The goal of this exam is to see if you can hunt and provide for your village while being able to show the proper qualities of a Guardian . This isn t a competition . You have the whole day to find a suitable prey and bring back to the village before sundown . Whoever come back with a suitable prey will pass and become an_Elder_Guardian ($_elder) . Their instructor said . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was literally vibrating from excitement . 
"
13819428,2,7,"I can t wait ! Who knows what I might go after ? A deer ? A moose ? Or maybe there s a bear around here ! Oh , I can t choose ! He said , mumbling to himself about the endless possibilities of suitable prey . When the group was released to go hunting , Kirishima ($_kirishima) made a beeline for the closest source of water , and waited in the bushes for anything to approach the small pond . 
"
13819428,2,8,"After what seemed like hours , nearing midday , a sizable bear came to the pond . It did n't seem to notice the young dragon shifter in the bushes , which was a grave mistake . In an instant , a short sword was embedded in its side as red blur tackled it to the ground and stabbed its heart . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stood up from his ($_kirishima) position and pulled his ($_kirishima) blades out from the bear , licking the blood . 
"
13819428,2,9,"Sweet! I got a male ! He ($_kirishima) s huge ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) exclaimed happily to himself ($_kirishima) . Putting his ($_kirishima) swords away , the_young_Dragon ($_the) transforms into his ($_kirishima) half dragon form and picks up the bear , careful to stay to the forest . He ($_kirishima) s heard rumors about Dragon Hunters , but never really believed them until he ($_kirishima) saw one up close when he ($_kirishima) was younger . Ever since then , even if he ($_kirishima) was in his ($_kirishima) half dragon form , he ($_kirishima) was always careful about using any of his ($_kirishima) dragon abilities during the_day ($_the) . 
"
13819428,2,10,"It ($_the) s nearing sundown when he ($_kirishima) arrives at the village . Walking in with a large bear draped over his ($_kirishima) back , he ($_kirishima) s greeted by Goro , who managed to hunt down a fairly large moose and a few others . By the_time_everyone ($_kirishima) returned to the village , only one out of the 15 of them ($_kirishima) didn t pass . 
"
13819428,2,11,"That night , in the_great_Cavern ($_the) , the village celebrated their newest Elder guardians with laughter , song , dance and a feast , made from their kills . What no one noticed was the suspicious group of humans nearing the village and killing the current guardians . 
"
13819428,2,12,"It was n't long until Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt something was very wrong and left the_cavern ($_the) to go check on the village . What he ($_kirishima) was n't expecting was to see the dead bodies of the guardians and a few humans scattered around the village . Houses were burning everywhere and , thinking quickly before he ($_kirishima) could be spotted , ran back towards the_cavern ($_the) . The village is under attack ! The guardians are dead ! The red head screamed into the hall , tears pouring down his ($_kirishima) face . Immediately , any dragon the could fight ran past him ($_kirishima) to go deal with the intruders . 
"
13819428,2,13,"Eijirou . Stay here and protect the elderly and children . If they come here , call to your ancestors for aid . I 'll see you soon , son . Your mother and I love you . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s father said to him ($_kirishima) before joining his ($_kirishima) wife in the fight . Kirishima ($_kirishima) nodded and grabbed his ($_kirishima) short swords , ready to fight of anyone if they mean harm . 
"
13819428,2,14,"After Kirishima ($_kirishima) managed to hide the children and elderly to a safe part of the_Cavern ($_the) , he ($_kirishima) ran back to the main hall , only to find a massacre . His ($_kirishima) friends and fellow dragon shifters lay dead on the ground , blood pouring out from their wounds . Broken wings , horns and scales littered the floor around them . Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew very few things can penetrate and kill dragons , but the fact that his friends lay dead on the floor in front of him , half transformed , meant that the attackers are either Dragon Hunters or Bandits who scored lucky . 
"
13819428,2,15,"Anger and rage built up in the young guardian , letting his dragon heritage take control . Growing large , red wings and a long tail , white horns sprouting from his head and his eyes becoming slits , Kirishima ($_kirishima) charged forward a the hunters at the other end of the hall . 
"
13819428,2,16,"Well , would you look at that , boys ! A red beauty ! Thought they all died off years ago ! 
"
13819428,2,17,"Guess we found our prize . Do n't rough him up to much , boys . We want him alive , after all . 
"
13819428,2,18,"That was all Kirishima ($_kirishima) managed to hear before his world was coated in red , then black .
