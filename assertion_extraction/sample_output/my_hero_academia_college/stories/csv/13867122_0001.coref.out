"
13867122,1,3,"Smell of smoke . 
"
13867122,1,4,"Pain . 
"
13867122,1,5,"Help me . 
"
13867122,1,6,"I stumbled on my steps , my body felt heavy and I felt like my surroundings were drowning in a sea of darkness and death . I noticed people , my people , run towards me and accidentally push me aside in order to escape the doom that had fallen over this once beautiful place . I hit my back against the stone wall and slid to sit down . My half red , half white hair was dirtied by the ash that silently floated in the air like black snow . 
"
13867122,1,7,"How could this ? My eyes felt like they were burning as I pushed the tears back with all my might . I pushed myself on my feet by taking support from the wall . 
"
13867122,1,8,"Just moments ago , I had been playing by the lake with my friends and now 
"
13867122,1,9,"I inhaled , I was feeling so afraid but I needed to get to my siblings . My parents , my mother , even father . 
"
13867122,1,10,"Please be alright! 
"
13867122,1,11,"I forced my legs to move even though they felt like I was glued to the ground . I started running through the destroyed streets but I didn t get too far when I heard screaming . A woman s voice ! 
"
13867122,1,12,"Help me ! My baby - ! I stopped to look around to figure out where the voice came from . Took me moment but I figured out which house the woman was screaming in . 
"
13867122,1,13,"I tried pulling the door open but it was stuck , at the end I had to take few steps backwards and kick it open . When I ran inside I lifted my hand to my face , there was smoke everywhere . I heard the woman scream upstairs so I ran there as fast as my legs allowed me to . 
"
13867122,1,14,"Please , someone help me ! 
"
13867122,1,15,"I m here ! I shouted as I reached the room and noticed a petite woman with her child crying in front of her as the baby was too young to understand what was happening . Her blue eyes tearing up at the sight of me . Her lower body was trapped under the huge closet . I bit my lip and ran to her to lift the closet . 
"
13867122,1,16,"Prince Todoroki ! Thank god you re here ! The woman wept when she realized who I ($_i) was . I ($_i) smiled at her in order to bring her relief but in reality I ($_i) was freaking out . The closet weighed a ton and this place was already falling apart . 
"
13867122,1,17,"I ($_i) need you to drag yourself from under the closet once I ($_i) lift it , can you do that ? I ($_i) asked and she nodded hastily . I ($_i) then took a deep breath and started lifting . 
"
13867122,1,18,"My ($_i) muscles screamed in protest but I ($_i) refused to listen . I ($_i) needed to help this woman ! 
"
13867122,1,19,"Finally she pulled herself from under the closet and I ($_i) dropped it down with a loud thump . I ($_i) turned to see how she was and frowned as I ($_i) saw the condition her legs were in . 
"
13867122,1,20,"Can you walk ? I ($_i) asked and she tested her legs a bit before nodding and lifting her child . 
"
13867122,1,21,"Thank you Prince Todoroki , thank you so much ! She cried . 
"
13867122,1,22,"You re welcome , but we need to get going before this place falls apart . I ($_i) said , helping her to get downstairs . We barely got outside when the house gave in and started to crumble . The woman started crying again . I ($_i) felt bad for her but I ($_i) needed to get going . You need to take your child and get away from here , okay ? 
"
13867122,1,23,"She stared at me ($_i) before nodding and I ($_i) patted her back . She thanked me ($_i) before escaping as well . 
"
13867122,1,24,"I ($_i) stared at her silver hair as she disappeared in the distance . It reminded me ($_i) of my ($_i) mother s hair . After I ($_i) could not see that white shine , I ($_i) turned and resumed running towards the huge smoking castle looming in the distance . My ($_i) home . 
"
13867122,1,25,"I ($_i) swallowed my ($_i) fear when I ($_i) saw corpses lying on the ground , dozens of people with eyes turned to glass while their bodies were already rotting . 
"
13867122,1,26,"It was a detail I ($_i) did not register at first but a detail I d remember for the rest of my ($_i) life . 
"
13867122,1,27,"My ($_i) body ran cold when I ($_i) noticed the castle doors broken down like something had gone through them with ease . 
"
13867122,1,28,"Mother ! I ($_i) screamed out and picked up my ($_i) pace , ignoring my ($_i) body s complaints . I ($_i) needed to get there , I ($_i) just needed to . 
"
13867122,1,29,"Inside the castle was in ruins , wrecked beyond repair . The sight made me ($_i) feel lightheaded but I ($_i) forced myself ($_i) to ignore it . Fear was being pushed down by my ($_i) need to protect those closest to me ($_i) . 
"
13867122,1,30,"I ($_i) got to the main hall and it happened like it was in slow motion . A heavy man fell right before my ($_i) eyes on the beautiful stone floor . My ($_i) brain couldn t even comprehend what had happened when my ($_i) father called out my ($_i) name with the weakest voice I ($_i) have ever heard come out of his mouth . 
"
13867122,1,31,"... your siblings . That was all I ($_i) needed to hear to make me ($_i) run as fast as I ($_i) possibly could . 
"
13867122,1,32,"I ($_i) ran up the broken stairs , I ($_i) heard a scream and I ($_i) could feel tears burning in my ($_i) eyes . To hear my ($_i) mother scream like that , to hear my ($_i) sister cry , my ($_i) brothers yell . 
"
13867122,1,33,"I ($_i) finally got to the room where they were , it was my ($_i) room . My ($_i) room was on the highest floor , of course my ($_i) father would tell them to hide here . 
"
13867122,1,34,"Shock rode through my ($_i) body when I ($_i) saw my ($_i) baby brother fall to the ground , body rotting away in seconds . 
"
13867122,1,35,"The fear that I ($_i) had been pushing down was forcing its way up my ($_i) throat and I ($_i) puked . I ($_i) had never seen a body before , and for it to be my ($_i) sibling no less ? 
"
13867122,1,36,"Cold shivers ran through my ($_i) back as I ($_i) saw a man with blue hair lift my ($_i) mother byher shirt , behind the man was a monster that barely fit in the room despite the high ceiling . 
"
13867122,1,37,"S-stop . . ! I ($_i) shout , my ($_i) knees barely keeping me ($_i) up . I ($_i) realize the man s face is hidden with a hand , a dead man s hand . 
"
13867122,1,38,"He turns to me ($_i) , my ($_i) sister cries with my ($_i) other brother in her arms . 
"
13867122,1,39,"Shoto ... run My ($_i) mother musters . Take your siblings and run ! 
"
13867122,1,40,"I ($_i) grab the sword from the counter , it s supposed to be a family heirloom but it was the only weapon I ($_i) could have in my ($_i) hands at that moment . 
"
13867122,1,41,"The man seems amused , and his shoulders shake like he s giggling . 
"
13867122,1,42,"Let her go ! I ($_i) repeat , hoping the fear in my ($_i) voice isn t obvious to him . He doesn t even speak as he places his fifth finger that hadn t touched my ($_i) mother s skin around her throat . Her skin rots in the blink of an eye . My ($_i) knees give in as I ($_i) fall to the floor at the same time as he drops my ($_i) mother s body . 
"
13867122,1,43,"Nomu ($_nomu) The huge monster turns it ($_nomu) s head towards me ($_i) but I ($_i) can t really lift my ($_i) head from the ground . 
"
13867122,1,44,"Shoto ($_shoto) ! My ($_i) sister s voice sounds like a muffled static , I m still trying to cope with my ($_i) mother s death . I ($_i) barely register the huge monster lift me ($_i) from my ($_i) blue royal coat . My ($_i) sister s scream finally breaks me ($_i) away from my ($_i) trance . 
"
13867122,1,45,"Seeing the monster s bird like face makes all my ($_i) blood freeze . I ($_i) start thrashing around , trying to hit the monster with my ($_i) sword . It carries me ($_i) all the way to the balcony , I ($_i) see my ($_i) sister holding my ($_i) little brother who cries out my ($_i) name . I ($_i) see the sun peeking out from behind the clouds , burning as a blood red dusk . 
"
13867122,1,46,"Red light shines off the monster s face and my ($_i) sword . I ($_i) lift it and finally pierce through the monster s eye . 
"
13867122,1,47,"The monster screams and let s go and I ($_i) find myself ($_i) falling down . 
"
13867122,1,48,"The sun feels like it s laughing at me ($_i) , colored by the blood of my ($_i) people . Blood of my ($_i) family . 
"
13867122,1,49,"Shoto ($_shoto) !! 
"
13867122,1,50,"My ($_i) sister s voice feels so far away , I ($_i) feel weightless and I ($_i) find it easier to just close my ($_i) eyes . 
"
13867122,1,51,"To let go. 
"
13867122,1,52,"To fall into a deep sleep . 
"
13867122,1,53,"I ($_i) dream of that lake , my ($_i) friends around me ($_i) smiling . I ($_i) dream of the greenest leaves before the sky grew dark . Before everything crumbled . When all was good and right . 
"
13867122,1,54,"Then I ($_i) see everything breaking down , my ($_i) friends burn right in front of me ($_i) . My ($_i) body feels like it s covered with thousands of needles as my ($_i) family rots in front of me ($_i) . Their smiles disappearing from my ($_i) memory . 
"
13867122,1,55,"I ($_i) call out to them . 
"

"
13867122,1,59,"I ($_i) gasp as my ($_i) mind pulls me ($_i) awake from my ($_i) nightmare . My ($_i) body feels like it s on fire as I ($_i) try to grasp my ($_i) current situation . What happened, what???.

13867122,1,61,"Nomu Let them go ! 
"
13867122,1,62,"Shoto ($_shoto) !! 
"
13867122,1,63,"I ($_i) sob and lift my ($_i) hands to my ($_i) face . Tears that I ($_i) had been holding start flowing down my ($_i) cheeks . I ($_i) remember all of it , all of the horror that I ($_i) had just witnessed . 
"
13867122,1,64,"I ($_i) hear a door open and only now I ($_i) realize that I m sitting on a bed , inside a cottage . An old man stands by the door with a tray , a woman who I ($_i) believe to be his wife , peeks from behind him . She smiles warmly as they both enter the room . 
"
13867122,1,65,"We heard you wake up . The woman said with a gentle voice as her husband lays the tray on my lap . There s some soup there with milk in the glass , fresh milk too . 
"
13867122,1,66,"I ($_i) have so many questions yet my ($_i) mouth runs empty . She doesn t seem to mind it , she just nods to her husband . Tell us if you need anything more , we ll be right in the next room . 
"
13867122,1,67,"I ($_i) can t even nod to her as she closes the door behind them . 
"
13867122,1,68,"I ($_i) stare at the food , I ($_i) should probably eat it . I ($_i) grab the spoon and lift some soup to my ($_i) lips , I ($_i) can smell the meat in it . I ($_i) try to swallow the food but the moment I ($_i) do , the image of my ($_i) rotting mother and brother comes back to my ($_i) mind and I ($_i) almost puke it back out . 
"
13867122,1,69,"I ($_i) manage to keep it in . 
"
13867122,1,70,"I ($_i) lie on the bed , the woman comes in and notices the tray on the nightstand nearly untouched . I ($_i) hear her sigh but don t see her as I m lying face away from her . 
"
13867122,1,71,"You should eat you know ? I ($_i) hear her say in her soft voice , she knows I ($_i) m not sleeping . I ($_i) couldn t possibly sleep , the nightmares would catch on . I ($_i) feel the woman sit on the bed as it shifts under her weight . She seems to contemplate what to say to me ($_i) . 
"
13867122,1,72,"Where am I ($_i) ? My ($_i) voice is much drier than I ($_i) remember it being , it doesn t even sound familiar to me ($_i) . 
"
13867122,1,73,"She seems slightly taken back of me ($_i) speaking . 
"
13867122,1,74,"Dell ` erba . It takes me ($_i) a moment until I ($_i) recognize the small town she speaks of . I ($_i) sit back up in shock when I ($_i) realize where I ($_i) am . The town is pretty far away from my ($_i) home , like really far away . 
"
13867122,1,75,"How-???
"
13867122,1,76,"We found you near the shores , river had brought you quite the distance . She said and then smiled . We decided to take you with us to our village . The place where we found you is only few kilometers away from here . 
"
13867122,1,77,"I ($_i) stared at her eyes wide and mouth fallen open . The fact that I ($_i) had fallen from that height and not hit any rocks was a miracle on it s own but me ($_i) not drowning and then being found ? It was all so ridiculous . 
"
13867122,1,78,"You can call me ($_i) Chie . The old lady said with a careful smile . I ($_i) looked down and grabbed tightly from the blanket on me ($_i) . Would you be kind enough to share me ($_i) your name ? 
"
13867122,1,79,"I ($_i) opened my ($_i) mouth few times to speak but I ($_i) had to practically to force it to speak . 
"
13867122,1,80,"My ($_i) name is Shoto ($_shoto) . I ($_i) ended up telling her my ($_i) first name instead of my ($_i) surname . I ($_i) did not wish to be recognized as the Prince of the famous Todoroki family . 
"
13867122,1,81,"Well Shoto , you sure have gorgeous hair . She said and patted my ($_i) head . It felt surprisingly reassuring . 
"
13867122,1,82,"Thank you ($_i) . I ($_i) finally spoke . For saving my ($_i) life . 
"
13867122,1,83,"You ($_i) re welcome little one , we heard what happened in the upriver kingdom . It s a miracle you ($_i) survived . She responded , tilting her head in a understanding manner . 
"
13867122,1,84,"... Is everyone dead ? I ($_i) found myself ($_i) asking before I ($_i) thought about it . I ($_i) didn t want to know , I ($_i) didn t want to feel alone .

13867122,1,86,"And now I ($_i) was truly alone . 
"
13867122,1,87,"After many hours of fear , stress and despair , a new feeling begun to take a hold of my ($_i) heart .

13867122,1,89,"Nomu 
"
13867122,1,90,"My ($_i) body started to shake , feeling of hot tenseness begun to fill me ($_i) up . My ($_i) fingers curled up to a fist and I ($_i) closed my ($_i) eyes .

13867122,1,92,"Ah , I ($_i) wonder if the fireplace is smoking . One second . Chie ($_chie) took the tray from the table and hastily left the room . 
"
13867122,1,93,"When she ($_chie) left , I ($_i) noticed the blanket that I ($_i) d been gripping onto . It was slightly burned from my ($_i) left hand ! I ($_i) tried wiping it away , thinking it was dirt but no . It was burned . 
"
13867122,1,94,"I ($_i) stared at it shocked and then turned to look at my ($_i) hand . It looked normal to me ($_i) , not smoking or dirty . 
"
13867122,1,95,"What the - I ($_i) turned to look on my ($_i) side and for the first time that night , I ($_i) realized the sword I ($_i) had been holding onto was laid on the floor next to the bed . My ($_i) family sword . 
"
13867122,1,96,"The feeling that had been interrupted was now back . The pure rage spreading into every neuron of my ($_i) body . 
"
13867122,1,97,"I ($_i) knew what it desired , I ($_i) was fully aware of it . 
"
13867122,1,98,"I ($_i) wanted revenge . 
"
13867122,1,99,"Before I ($_i) knew it , I ($_i) had taken my ($_i) sword and put on my ($_i) shoes . By the time Chie ($_chie) returned , I ($_i) was already gone . 
"
13867122,1,100,"I ($_i) wandered around the dark town , leaving without any money or food was foolish enough , but I ($_i) wasn t going to walk back to my ($_i) kingdom . Especially since it was in the middle of the night . 
"
13867122,1,101,"As I ($_i) looked around , I ($_i) made a note of how green the village was . Especially the grass , it was very beautiful in the pale moonlight and I ($_i) wished I ($_i) had visited it before what happened , happened . 
"
13867122,1,102,"I ($_i) stopped at the local stalls and noticed a bright looking white horse who immediately noticed me ($_i) and came to say hello . I ($_i) silently apologized to the owner of the said horse and just used my ($_i) sword to cut the horse free . 
"
13867122,1,103,"When it got excited , I ($_i) hushed so it would stay quiet . 
"
13867122,1,104,"I ($_i) knew how to ride a horse , it was my ($_i) favorite thing to do back at home . I ($_i) just hadn t ever ridden one without a saddle . I ($_i) then jumped to get on top of the horse . 
"
13867122,1,105,"Hey-! 
"
13867122,1,106,"I ($_i) kicked the horse gently on it s sides to make it run . The owner cursed after us but I ($_i) had no time to stay and explain . 
"
13867122,1,107,"Trying to get back home without knowing exactly where you were was much harder than I ($_i) had originally thought it would be .

13867122,1,108,"It took the whole night until I ($_i) reached the familiar hill . The sun was peeking from the distance and that made my ($_i) heart jump in expectation . 
"
13867122,1,109,"I ($_i) gently tapped the horses sides to get up the hill faster . My ($_i) heart sank the moment I ($_i) saw what my ($_i) kingdom had become . Ashes , ruins , filled with the bodies of my ($_i) people . 
"
13867122,1,110,"I ($_i) swallowed and my ($_i) horse slowed down . It must be tired , I ($_i) needed to bring it to the lake . 
"
13867122,1,111,"Hold on just a little bit longer . I ($_i) speak , it moves it s ear signaling it had heard me ($_i) . 
"
13867122,1,112,"I ($_i) jumped down from the horse and tied it to the nearby fence . 
"
13867122,1,113,"The ash was moved by the wind , showing me ($_i) nothing but greyness everywhere . 
"
13867122,1,114,"I ($_i) inhaled and moved forward . Through the broken doors and all the way to the main hall , I ($_i) stopped when I ($_i) saw my ($_i) father s corpse . 
"
13867122,1,115,"He wasn t rotting as fast , that man must not have touched him with their evil magic . I ($_i) kneeled down in front of him , I ($_i) didn t know what to say so I ($_i) just sat there in silence .

Instead he wanted to train me ($_i) because I ($_i) was supposed to be the strongest of my ($_i) siblings . Yet , his death brought me ($_i) heavy sorrow . I m sorry I ($_i) wasn t strong enough

13867122,1,117,"I ($_i) was about to speak more when his coat caught my ($_i) attention . It had been searched through . 
"
13867122,1,118,"Why would they ? 
"
13867122,1,119,"I ($_i) then remembered a golden key with strange decoration that my ($_i) father always had on his right chest pocket . I ($_i) checked it and noticed that the key was gone . I ($_i) quickly stood up , I ($_i) knew where that key fit in . 
"
13867122,1,120,"There was a door that lead to the underground catacombs . My ($_i) father always said that me ($_i) and my ($_i) siblings were not allowed to enter there so I ($_i) never knew what he was hiding inside .

13867122,1,123,"I ($_i) shouted in surprise and fell on my ($_i) butt . Magic ? Magic was nearly impossible to even use these days ! Yet it was the only thing that made sense , had my ($_i) father hid magic in here ? 
"
13867122,1,124,"That man used dark magic to kill everyone . Of course magic would also lure him here . I ($_i) gathered my ($_i) courage as I ($_i) got back on my ($_i) feet . Magic, right. Simple .

13867122,1,125,"I ($_i) begun descending to the underground , careful of each step . This was an unknown ground for me ($_i) , never would I ($_i) have guessed to actually have a chance to see what father hides in here .

13867122,1,127,"My ($_i) curiosity outweighed my ($_i) fear as I ($_i) walked forward in the lighted up hallway . The walls were covered in dust and spiderwebs , it was like no one had been here in ages . 
"
13867122,1,128,"Finally I ($_i) reached the end of the hallway , there was nothing but a wall here and I ($_i) frowned in disappointment . Had my ($_i) father closed the way to the catacombs ? Probably. 
"
13867122,1,129,"I ($_i) was about to turn around when something caught my ($_i) eye . There was a small picture painted near one of the torches . For a stranger it meant nothing , but for someone who had been taught it s meaning

13867122,1,130,"I ($_i) reached for the torch and pulled it . In one swift movement , it made a loud click noise . I ($_i) stepped back and then jumped when the wall started moving to the side .

13867122,1,131,"A secret door !

13867122,1,132,"It made me ($_i) realize that maybe the villains hadn t found what they had been looking for . I ($_i) was intrigued to see what was in there but at the same time I ($_i) felt slightly afraid . My ($_i) family was killed for whatever was inside that room .

13867122,1,133,"Finally I ($_i) entered the room and my ($_i) eyes widened in shock . The room was small but there were scrolls everywhere , armor and weapons . Strange horn laid on the decorative stand .

13867122,1,135,"My ($_i) famous ancestor from the legends and a man with a young woman with blond spiky hair standing next to him . Two latter were sitting on large dragons with my ($_i) ancestor offering them his hand that was lit on fire .

13867122,1,136,"I ($_i) stepped backwards , mouth open from shock . I ($_i) knew there were legends of my ($_i) ancestor , that he held the magic of fire but I ($_i) barely knew anything of him because my ($_i) mother didn t want to speak about it . I ($_i) accidentally hit my ($_i) back against the table and a huge scroll dropped on the floor .

13867122,1,137,"I ($_i) cursed as I ($_i) picked it up , there was a strange signet on it that caught my ($_i) eye . Slowly I ($_i) unwrapped the scroll and thanked my ($_i) mother for teaching me ($_i) the old languages .
