15717675,1,1,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) tilted his ($_todoroki) head slightly towards Midoriya ($_midoriya) beside him ($_todoroki) . `` Do you ($_todoroki) think it 's too late to leave ? '' 
"
15717675,1,2,"`` We did n't come all this way for nothing , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) kept his ($_midoriya) eyes focused on the doors of the throne room . `` He ($_midoriya) 'll help us . '' 
"
15717675,1,3,"`` You ($_todoroki) seem quite confident that a cold blooded killer will sympathize with our cause . '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) said . 
"
15717675,1,4,"`` I ($_todoroki) don t know what you ve heard , but the rumors are just that - rumors . Most seem too ridiculous to be true , right Iida ($_iida) ? '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) looked to the knight to his ($_midoriya) left . 
"
15717675,1,5,"`` I ($_todoroki) would have to agree that the stories of the barbarian warlord do seem a bit exaggerated . However , '' Iida ($_iida) lowered his ($_iida) voice , despite the four rebels being the only ones in the entryway . `` Just because the truth of a story has been stretched , it does not rule out the possibility that it is rooted in fact . Perhaps he does sit on a throne of bones and wear his enemies ' blood . There is only one way to know . '' 
"
15717675,1,6,"`` I heard he tamed a dragon by defeating it with his bare fists , '' Uraraka ($_uraraka) said . `` And that he fucks it . '' 
"
15717675,1,7,"The others turned and looked at her . 
"
15717675,1,8,"`` Uraraka , you can not say such things ! '' 
"
15717675,1,9,"`` Where - where did you hear that ?! '' 
"
15717675,1,10,"`` How does he manage that ... '' 
"
15717675,1,11,"Uraraka ($_uraraka) held up her ($_uraraka) hands in front of her ($_uraraka) . `` It s not that I believe it ! It 's just what I heard ! '' 
"
15717675,1,12,"Yes , but if all rumors are rooted in truth , then this raises something questions , Todoroki ($_todoroki) stated . 
"
15717675,1,13,"I didn t say all rumors were based in truth ! Iida ($_iida) started waving his ($_iida) hands to make his ($_iida) point . 
"
15717675,1,14,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) tried to regain some of his ($_midoriya) composure . `` Guys , this is serious . We ca n't - '' 
"
15717675,1,15,"The doors before them slowly began to open , the squealing of the hinges and loud creaking of the wood cutting off Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) train of thought . 
"
15717675,1,16,"The throne room was as they expected : a large open space with the only light coming from the dim torches lining the walls , making the center of the room darkest . Towards the back center of the room sat a throne with an odd , asymmetric shape outlined by the light ; the foot seeming almost too wide for a throne while the back seemed to narrow for rest against . Past the throne , they could see the far wall was lined with bones of varying sizes and shapes . Through the shadow of the bones , gold and other metals glittered in the firelight . Midoriya ($_midoriya) could smell smoke , but it seemed different from that of a torch . It was accompanied by a strangely sweet smell , but he couldn t quite seem to place it . Maybe-
"
15717675,1,17,"`` Are you going to stand there all day or did you come for something ? '' A voice sounded from throne . 
"
15717675,1,18,"It was easy to miss him . His skin and hair as pale as his throne , the flickering shadows making him seem as though he were part of it . 
"
15717675,1,19,"The four each took a step forward , standing side by side in front of the_king ($_the) . 
"
15717675,1,20,"`` We came seeking military aid from the King of the Mountains . '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) spoke up , managing to keep his ($_midoriya) voice steady as he ($_midoriya) found the harsh glare of the man before him ($_midoriya) . When he ($_midoriya) remained silent , Midoriya ($_midoriya) took it as permission to speak on . `` The land at the base of the mountain has - '' 
"
15717675,1,21,"`` Did I fucking tell you to continue ? '' The_king ($_the) yelled . `` Where is your tribute ? Hah ? You come in here , seek an audience with me for my aid , and do n't even think to bring a goddamn OFFERING ? '' 
"
15717675,1,22,"Lights crackled from his hands . For a second , the four could see the throne and king clearly . His chest was bare , with two dark red streaks crossing each other making an X . There was a collar of thick fur draped over his shoulders . His face was dark with soot , making the red of his eyes shine with his fire 's light . The throne itself was nothing more than a heap of skulls that he sat upon . 
"
15717675,1,23,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) mumbled something . Midoriya ($_midoriya) froze , but saw that no one else reacted . Taking this as a sign that he ($_midoriya) was only one who noticed , he ($_midoriya) ignored it . 
"
15717675,1,24,"`` We do n't have anything we can give you , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) prayed this would work . `` But we do have an offer you 'll like . '' 
"
15717675,1,25,"`` What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? '' The_king ($_the) was steadily raising his ($_the) voice as he ($_the) spoke . `` Just what the hell - '' 
"
15717675,1,26,"The clatter of bones and metal interrupted the scene . There was a yawn from behind the king s pile of bones followed by the scrapping of nails along the stone floor , slowly coming closer . 
"
15717675,1,27,"`` You were supposed to wake me before the visitors arrived , '' a figure appeared out from behind the makeshift throne . `` I thought we were going to discuss matters together , Katsuki . '' 
"
15717675,1,28,"`` They are not visitors . '' The_king_'s ($_the) voice lowered from his ($_the) yelling . `` And I did try to wake you , but you 're skull is too damn thick for anything to get through . '' 
"
15717675,1,29,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) heard the newcomer laugh slightly , he ($_midoriya) guessed they were still shaking off their sleep . The sound of nails stopped , replaced by the crunching of skulls underfoot . Midoriya ($_midoriya) held his ($_midoriya) breath for a moment to keep from giving away his ($_midoriya) shock ; Todoroki ($_todoroki) muttered something while the two on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s other side stood up straighter . The eyes were the first thing he ($_midoriya) saw ; the dull glow was hard to miss as the figure approached . Next was their odd silhouette . Spikes jutted out from both shoulders , and what seemed to be hair stood high above their face , with two particular chunks curving out , away from their face while still remaining upright . No , those reflected the light differently . Could they be horns ? Then , when they laughed , Midoriya ($_midoriya) caught a glimpse of teeth . Sharp , each one pointed like a weapon . He ($_midoriya) started to wonder if it was too late to leave . 
"
15717675,1,30,"`` You 're right . '' The_strange_man ($_midoriya) had made his ($_midoriya) way to the_king_'s ($_the) side to sit next him ($_midoriya) . He ($_midoriya) frowned slightly . `` I ($_midoriya) do n't recognize them . Why are they here ? '' 
"
15717675,1,31,"`` They need our help or some shit , '' the_king ($_the) said . He ($_midoriya) turned towards the newcomer . `` Did n't even bring anything . I think it 's a waste of fucking time . '' 
"
15717675,1,32,"The other leaned in closer to the king , resting a forearm on the_barbarian_'s ($_midoriya) thigh . `` Does that mean I can go back to my nap ? Maybe this time - '' 
"
15717675,1,33,"`` We do have an offering ! '' Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) voice echoed in the chamber . `` Yes , there 's nothing we can physically give to you , but helping us would mean partaking in the greatest fight to ever exist . '' 
"
15717675,1,34,"That got both their attentions . 
"
15717675,1,35,"""What is that supposed to mean?"" The_king ($_the) tried to sound bored but the corners of his ($_the) mouth were stretching into a fierce grin . 
"
15717675,1,36,"His ($_the) companion looked more concerned and less eager . `` You ($_midoriya) 're not going to give us anything ? '' 
"
15717675,1,37,"`` We 're offering an opportunity , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) said firmly . His ($_the) hand going to rest on the hilt of his ($_the) sword without thinking . `` We face the greatest enemy to ever exist , and we have within our possession the sword of the fallen god , All Might - '' 
"
15717675,1,38,"`` One For All . '' The_king ($_the) stood up . His ($_the) companion losing his ($_the) balance on the pile , skulls clattering onto the stone floor . `` You found One For All ? '' 
"
15717675,1,39,"""Yes. With it , I will fight great evil . '' Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) grip on the sword tightened . `` I intend to - '' 
"
15717675,1,40,"`` Give it to me . '' The_king ($_the) cut him ($_midoriya) off . He ($_the) slid down from the makeshift throne and approached Midoriya ($_midoriya) . `` Give me the sword as an offering , dumbass . '' 
"
15717675,1,41,"Before he ($_the) could reach Midoriya ($_midoriya) , the three rebels stepped between the two , each reaching for their sheathed weapons . They had agreed only to fight in the event that negotiations went south . Each believed in their leader and friend , but were also unwilling to see him ($_the) harmed . 
"
15717675,1,42,"`` So that 's how it 's going to be , huh ? '' Fire crackled in the kings palms . `` Fine , then let 's - '' 
"
15717675,1,43,"A hand grabbed the_King_'s ($_the) arm and held him ($_the) back . `` Calm the hell down . This is n't how a king behaves in a negotiation . '' 
"
15717675,1,44,"The_king ($_the) glared at his ($_the) companion . The room went silent . The_strange_man ($_midoriya) held the_king_'s ($_the) glare with a firm look . They ($_midoriya) seemed at a stalemate . Midoriya ($_midoriya) thought maybe he ($_midoriya) should speak up and explain more of the circumstances that he ($_midoriya) acquired the sword . If he ($_midoriya) could just get them ($_midoriya) to understand his ($_midoriya) situation then - 
"
15717675,1,45,"`` If the dragon can shift into a humanoid form then it would be easier for both to a find a pleasurable position . '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) mumbled . `` That could imply human genitalia , but the form seems to be human like and not completely human so does that mean ... '' 
"
15717675,1,46,"WHAT DID YOU SAY , BASTARD - 
"
15717675,1,47,"- Shoto no - 
"
15717675,1,48,"- Todoroki ($_todoroki) please refrain from saying such things - 
"
15717675,1,49,"- Oh my gods Todoroki ($_todoroki) , have you been thinking that this whole time - 
"
15717675,1,50,"Laughter drowned out everyone s shock . The_king ($_the) s companion had to lean on his ($_the) shoulder for support as he ($_the) laughed . The_king ($_the) took a step forward but the other pulled him ($_the) back , wiping at the corners of his ($_the) eyes . 
"
15717675,1,51,"Don ($_don) t kill him ($_the) , that was hilarious ! Holy shit , he ($_the) wheezed . I can t believe he ($_the) said that . Oh man , wait till the gang hears about this one . 
"
15717675,1,52,"The four looked dumbly at each other . 
"
15717675,1,53,"You re not , uh , Midoriya ($_midoriya) tried to find the right words to sound diplomatic and maybe stay alive . Offended? 
"
15717675,1,54,"Yeah! The_king ($_the) glared at his ($_the) companion still leaning on his ($_the) shoulder , but now less for support and more playfully . You re okay with him ($_the) saying that shit ? 
"
15717675,1,55,"Anyone brave enough to talk about my dick in front of my_king ($_the) deserves respect . The_man ($_midoriya) grinned at Todoroki ($_todoroki) . He ($_midoriya) jerked a thumb towards himself ($_midoriya) . Call me Kirishima ($_kirishima) . He ($_midoriya) , Kirishima ($_kirishima) pointed his ($_midoriya) thumb at the_king ($_the) , would probably prefer King Bakugou . 
"
15717675,1,56,"Don ($_don) t tell them to call me that , idiot . Bakugou ($_bakugou) shook his ($_bakugou) shoulder but the other didn t budge from his ($_bakugou) perch . 
"
15717675,1,57,"C mon , they re cool . Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked over the group and gave them a wide smile before turning back to his king . I trust them . 
"
15717675,1,58,"Thank you , Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Midoriya ($_midoriya) said . He ($_midoriya) wasn t sure how things had worked out this way , but he ($_midoriya) was grateful to the strange man all the same . Him ($_midoriya) , and Todoroki ($_todoroki) s complete lack of social awareness . 
"
15717675,1,59,"No worries , man . Kirishima ($_kirishima) yawned , trying to hide it behind one of his ($_kirishima) clawed hands . I want to hear more about this battle . 
"
15717675,1,60,"You re going back to sleep , dumbass . You don t even have enough energy to be human right now . Bakugou ($_bakugou) shoved Kirishima ($_kirishima) s face , forcing him ($_kirishima) to take a step back . 
"
15717675,1,61,"Alright , alright , he ($_kirishima) was laughing again . Don ($_don) t continue the negotiation without me , though . Show them to guest quarters so they can rest as well . 
"
15717675,1,62,"The_king ($_the) crossed his ($_the) arms and looked back at who were now his ($_the) guests . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was such an ass sometimes goddamnit . Fine . 
"
15717675,1,63,"Guest quarters ? So you ll hear us out ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) had to ask . They d gone from preparing to fight the_king ($_the) to staying in his ($_the) castle as his ($_the) guests . He ($_the) needed to make sure this was real . 
"
15717675,1,64,"Yes I ll listen to your fucking request , Bakugou ($_bakugou) pushed past them to the doors . I ll show you the rooms and then someone will retrieve you once we re ready to negotiate . 
"
15717675,1,65,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) was already following Bakugou ($_bakugou) out the room while the other three were still reeling . Uraraka and Iida followed after Todoroki ($_todoroki) , making Midoriya ($_midoriya) the last to leave the throne room . 
"
15717675,1,66,"I look forward to our meeting ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) called from within the chambers . Don ($_don) t piss off my_king ($_the) too much until then . I d rather you all didn t die .
