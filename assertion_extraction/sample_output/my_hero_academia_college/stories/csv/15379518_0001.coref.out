15379518,1,1,"The shop is small but it will do , Todoroki ($_todoroki) thinks as he ($_midoriya) pushes open the door to enter . A little bell tinkles his ($_midoriya) welcome and he ($_midoriya) blinks at the red ribbon tied on top of it . Not many witches would so blatantly use such urban magic , knowing that most look down upon those that use the modern ways . 
"
15379518,1,2,"He ($_midoriya) moves slowly inside , and it only takes him ($_midoriya) a moment to realize that a gigantification spell has been used on it 's interior . Not particularly rare , given the spell 's popularity among witches , but the amount that the shop 's size has been grown ... he ($_midoriya) looks around and ah , yes , there it is , traditional runes painted in blue , the color of the ocean and sky -LRB- the widest expanse there is -RRB- . 
"
15379518,1,3,"But Todoroki ($_todoroki) is n't here to browse , so he ($_midoriya) moves quickly , his ($_midoriya) cursed hand tucked into his ($_midoriya) pocket and a glove on his ($_midoriya) blessed hand , put on with care so that his ($_midoriya) touch does n't freeze anything . 
"
15379518,1,4,"He ($_midoriya) stands in the curse undoing section for a long time , browsing through purifying feathers and containment marbles before he ($_midoriya) is about to give up . 
"
15379518,1,5,"He ($_midoriya) frowns a bit . 
"
15379518,1,6,"He ($_midoriya) had hoped to find a good talisman and get it over with , but he ($_midoriya) should know better . 
"
15379518,1,7,"Thankfully , on his ($_midoriya) way out , Todoroki ($_todoroki) finds a tablet saying personalized spells at the front hanging from the window . 
"
15379518,1,8,"The_boy_at_the_counter ($_midoriya) has a slight frame , a green vest and simple white button down . He ($_midoriya) has n't the mark on his ($_midoriya) temple revealing him ($_midoriya) as a witch , so Todoroki ($_todoroki) is surprised when he ($_midoriya) asks after the shop 's witch and the_boy ($_midoriya) smiles , `` Oh , that 's me ($_midoriya) ! '' 
"
15379518,1,9,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) blinks a bit , dumbfounded , and the_boy ($_midoriya) sticks out a hand and introduces himself ($_midoriya) as Midoriya Izuku , but you can just call me Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
"
15379518,1,10,"`` Todoroki ($_todoroki) , '' He ($_midoriya) shakes Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) hand with his ($_midoriya) gloved one and pulls out his ($_midoriya) other , `` I ($_midoriya) have a cursed arm , and I ($_midoriya) was hoping that you could help me ($_midoriya) get rid of it ? '' 
"
15379518,1,11,"`` I ($_midoriya) hope you do n't mean by amputation , '' Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) light smile is enough to show that he ($_midoriya) 's joking and Todoroki ($_todoroki) holds out his ($_midoriya) cursed arm . Midoriya ($_midoriya) examines it with narrow eyes , `` Hm ... orange runes ? Rare , that someone would take the time to do it so delicately , and to have it hand painted like this makes it very powerful but guessing from the residue left , it must have been there since a young age , possibly just a little before birth , meaning that someone would have had to pre-plan and ... '' 
"
15379518,1,12,"He ($_midoriya) mumbles a bit more , effectively guessing and running through all the options , before Midoriya ($_midoriya) leans back and shakes his ($_midoriya) head . 
"
15379518,1,13,"Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) heart sinks . 
"
15379518,1,14,"`` I 'm sorry , Todoroki-san ($_todoroki-san) , '' Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) voice is soft , apologetic , `` I ca n't help you get rid of it . '' 
"
15379518,1,15,"Frustration bubbles up in Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) Todoroki_'s_chest ($_todoroki) , `` Then there must be someone who can , '' he ($_midoriya) says desperately , `` Can you refer me ($_midoriya) to another witch ? '' 
"
15379518,1,16,"Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) eyes are cool , dark , `` Your ($_midoriya) arm is n't cursed , Todoroki-san ($_todoroki-san) , it 's blessed . '' # . "" No , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) shakes his ($_todoroki) head , `` My ($_todoroki) hand sets everything that I ($_todoroki) touch on fire . '' 
"
15379518,1,17,"`` We can alter that slightly , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) dips his ($_midoriya) head , `` But it 's a blessing . '' 
"
15379518,1,18,"`` I ($_todoroki) do n't want this blessing , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) grits his teeth , `` Can you get rid of blessings ? '' 
"
15379518,1,19,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) sighs at him and nods at his other arm , `` There should be a water-based blessing on that arm , to balance the two . '' 
"
15379518,1,20,"`` There is , but , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) shakes his head , `` I do n't want this . '' 
"
15379518,1,21,"`` I ca n't get rid of it , then , '' Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) frown is telling , and Todoroki ($_todoroki) wants to get rid of it somehow , `` You always need a balance . '' He taps the side of his ($_midoriya) head , `` You 're a witch , so you , of all people , should know . Elemental magic is powerful , but that makes it dangerous . Everyone knows the tale of the fire witch from Ennan who burned from the inside out . '' 
"
15379518,1,22,"`` I can handle it , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) shakes his ($_todoroki) head , stubborn . 
"
15379518,1,23,"`` You ca n't , '' Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) Midoriya_'s_gaze_hardens ($_midoriya) , `` Let me see your other arm . '' 
"
15379518,1,24,"Reluctantly , Todoroki ($_todoroki) pulls off his ($_todoroki) glove and rolls up his ($_todoroki) sleeve so that Midoriya ($_midoriya) can see the pastel blue runes written on his ($_todoroki) right arm . Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) fingers trace the curl of the rune over his ($_midoriya) wrist and the stocky block of the band at the base of his ($_midoriya) knuckles to ensure that the magic does n't escape and infect anything , and then Midoriya ($_midoriya) shakes his ($_midoriya) head . 
"
15379518,1,25,"`` Your magic is perfectly balanced . If you get rid of one , the other will consume you . '' 
"
15379518,1,26,"`` I ($_midoriya) do n't care ! '' Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) voice is desperate , pleading now , `` I ($_midoriya) do n't need my ($_midoriya) fire ! '' 
"
15379518,1,27,"`` Everyone needs fire , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) puts a seed on the counter and holds out his ($_midoriya) finger . It turns green and he ($_midoriya) paints out familiar earthen runes , then he ($_midoriya) paints the figures for sun , brook , breath around in a circle . The rune lowers to the seed and a sapling sprouts out , curling and a soft pink flower blooming from the side . `` This plant needs sun to grow , yes ? It needs to be watered , and takes in oxygen to survive . It plants it 's root in soil , and because it has all four elements , it survives . '' 
"
15379518,1,28,"Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) heart pounds in his_chest ($_todoroki) , `` I am not a plant , '' he says . 
"
15379518,1,29,"`` But you are alive , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) claps his ($_midoriya) hands together and the plant turns to rune , the pink flower curling into golden ink for sun , leaves melting into breath and the rest of it dissolving into runes before it is simply a seed again , `` And all living things need balance . '' 
"
15379518,1,30,"`` I ($_midoriya) will be more balanced without the fire , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) knows that he ($_todoroki) 's fighting an empty battle but he ($_todoroki) tries anyway . 
"
15379518,1,31,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) glares at him ($_todoroki) , `` The only way to destroy that arm is through dark magic , and the results will kill you ($_todoroki) . '' 
"
15379518,1,32,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) lowers his ($_todoroki) head , jaw set in irritation , `` Then what do I ($_todoroki) do ? '' He ($_todoroki) demands . 
"
15379518,1,33,"`` You accept it , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) pushes a hand against his ($_midoriya) chest , eyes blazing , `` Your fire is a part of you . I ($_midoriya) do n't know why you dislike it , but whatever fire has done in the past , whoever gave you that rune , it does not matter . Magic has no past , only a present , and right now , that fire belongs to you and you alone . No other mana can be fed to it , and you are the one who chooses to use it so choose it . '' 
"
15379518,1,34,"`` It destroys everything that I touch ! '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) yells . 
"
15379518,1,35,"`` Because you wo n't accept it ! '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) yells back , `` Because you suppress it , as though magic can be suppressed ! You hold it back as though it 's a dog , some pet , instead of a living , breathing part of you ! '' 
"
15379518,1,36,"`` Then what do I do ? '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) breathes , chest heaving , breath ragged . 
"
15379518,1,37,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) sighs , `` Then you ($_midoriya) let it be . '' 
"
15379518,1,38,"`` It will turn everything to fire , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) shakes his ($_todoroki) head , `` It will burn your shop down . '' 
"
15379518,1,39,"`` Do n't be over dramatic , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) snorts , leans over , and brushes his ($_midoriya) fingers against Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) wrist , `` You see this band here ? It 's an ending rune , and if I 'm correct , you have one on your bicep as well . Ending runes are especially important because they do the job of containing magic , and yours seals your fire within . My guess is ... '' 
"
15379518,1,40,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) rambles a bit , babbling on and pointing to each rune and explaining their purpose . He ($_midoriya) takes over an hour to talk , occasionally stopping and asking Todoroki ($_todoroki) if this is alright . It is , Todoroki ($_todoroki) says each time , awed and humbled by the shopkeeper 's knowledge . 
"
15379518,1,41,"At the end , Todoroki ($_todoroki) does n't quite understand it ($_todoroki) as much as Midoriya ($_midoriya) does , but he ($_midoriya) understands that the magic is his ($_midoriya) and it is safe and good and none of it belongs to Endeavor . 
"
15379518,1,42,"`` I ($_midoriya) accept it , '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) breathes , and the end , eyes closed and head bowed to Midoriya , `` Thank you . '' 
"
15379518,1,43,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiles , `` Then activate it . '' 
"
15379518,1,44,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) does , and the runes burn , fire licking each but not spreading , glowing bright and powerful and strong , the entire shop illuminated in sunset gold before it ($_todoroki) dies down , and the runes are normal again . 
"
15379518,1,45,"He ($_midoriya) gives his ($_midoriya) thanks to Midoriya once again , and Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiles back . 
"
15379518,1,46,"`` Since you 're , um , still in training , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) gestures at the mark on Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) temple , half done , the sign of a witch-in-training , `` My shop has , ah , books and talismans . If you want to , ah , shop here , I mean . '' 
"
15379518,1,47,"`` Trying to drum up more business ? '' Todoroki ($_todoroki) teases , trying to banish the memory of Midoriya ($_midoriya) looking stunning as he summons his magic and paints runes on the seed . 
"
15379518,1,48,"Midoriya turns red and stammers a few things before he calms and fiddles with his sleeves , `` It would be nice to see you again , '' he admits , voice soft , `` Balanced . Not just because you 're balanced , I mean . You 're more than your magic . Obviously. It would just be relieving , since it 's healthier . Because I want to see you healthy . Not just you , I mean , I like seeing people healthy in general . But it 's not that I do n't like you ! I mean , I do n't really know you . But I 'm sure that you 're a great person ! '' 
"
15379518,1,49,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) lets Midoriya ($_midoriya) babble a bit more , and when he stops to take a breath , Todoroki ($_todoroki) says , `` I ($_todoroki) 'll see you again , then , when I ($_todoroki) come back to buy something . '' 
"
15379518,1,50,"Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) eyes are wide , surprised for a moment before he beams back , bright and eager , `` I 'll see you then ! ''
