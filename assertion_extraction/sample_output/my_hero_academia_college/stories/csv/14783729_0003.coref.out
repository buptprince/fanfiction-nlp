14783729,3,1,"They ended up talking a for a long time , until the stars had shifted in the sky and the very first signs of morning had started to show . Izuku ($_izuku) liked to talk a lot , he ($_izuku) often went on tangents and tended to ramble , but Shouto ($_shouto) found that he ($_izuku) didn t mind it at all . He ($_izuku) liked the ease of it , the way he ($_izuku) could sink into his ($_izuku) words and listen , like he ($_izuku) were soaking in a warm bath . Izuku ($_izuku) should be a stranger to him ($_izuku) , yet he ($_izuku) was oddly at ease . Not enough to say much , but he ($_izuku) didn t feel he ($_izuku) had to keep magic at his ($_izuku) fingertips for preemptive measures . 
"
14783729,3,2,"Eventually , however , he ($_izuku) had to convince Izuku ($_izuku) to go back to his ($_izuku) quarters and sleep , with the promise that they d meet again soon . He ($_izuku) didn t want to go back into the castle either , but he ($_izuku) couldn t get caught out of his ($_izuku) room after daybreak . He ($_izuku) couldn t get caught out of his ($_izuku) room at night at all really . 
"
14783729,3,3,"Hopefully I ll get to talk to you again . Izuku ($_izuku) said , fidgeting with his ($_izuku) hands . Then he ($_izuku) turned pink , Sorry , that might sound weird 
"
14783729,3,4,"No , of course . Shouto ($_shouto) said , I d like to see you again too . 
"
14783729,3,5,"At this Izuku just got more flustered , and he ($_izuku) started mumbling out a thanks , and a promise to make a plan , followed by the beginnings of a plan , followed by the logistics and pitfalls of a possible plan . 
"
14783729,3,6,"Leave it to me . Shouto ($_shouto) gently cut Izuku ($_izuku) s rambling off , I ll see you soon . 
"
14783729,3,7,"Okay. Izuku ($_izuku) gave him ($_izuku) a determined sort of smile , Goodnight . 
"
14783729,3,8,"Shouto ($_shouto) unconsciously dipped his ($_shouto) head in a sort of bow , before turning back to walk to the castle . He ($_shouto) had to weave through a labyrinth of hedges , the sculpture garden , back to the cellar doors he ($_shouto) d used to sneak out . 
"
14783729,3,9,"He ($_shouto) d remembered Izuku ($_izuku) , somehow , as a concept that never truly left him ($_izuku) . He ($_shouto) d grown up unable to play with other kids , he ($_shouto) always had something he ($_shouto) had to be doing , training , studying . His ($_shouto) only friend had been Momo , but she was always just as busy as he ($_shouto) was , as an apprentice . The time his ($_shouto) mother let him ($_shouto) escape had been one of the handful he ($_shouto) d been able to have , and he ($_shouto) always remembered the idea of someone who d once said he ($_shouto) was a friend . While he ($_shouto) didn t want to get ahead of himself ($_shouto) , Shouto ($_shouto) hoped this ($_shouto) was something he ($_shouto) could keep , an actual friend . 
"
14783729,3,10,"Shouto ($_shouto) had to find a night that he ($_shouto) was free to escape his ($_shouto) lessons . Many nights he ($_shouto) was required to study ; as future king he ($_shouto) must be cultured and well read . He ($_shouto) d be confined to a heavy wooden desk and surrounded by thick leather bound books with yellowing parchment pages , each one more boring than the last . His ($_shouto) tutors made him ($_shouto) recite passages from memory and keep conversations about concepts so boring that Shouto ($_shouto) could feel himself ($_shouto) falling asleep as he ($_shouto) talked . He ($_shouto) much preferred the fictional stories from the castle s library , stories that let him ($_shouto) experience a freedom he ($_shouto) s long been denied . But a future king is not to distract himself ($_shouto) with fictional tales . 
"
14783729,3,11,"Shouto didn t want to be the future king . 
"
14783729,3,12,"By design he ($_shouto) was powerful , it was by his ($_shouto) father s intentions , but he ($_shouto) wasn t naturally gifted , he ($_shouto) d skills beaten into him ($_shouto) , in many senses . But that s never what he ($_shouto) wanted . He ($_shouto) wasn t even sure what he ($_shouto) could want . 
"
14783729,3,13,"What he ($_shouto) liked was to wander the grounds , through the gardens , around the mossy pond shaded by the long draping branches of a weeping willow . He ($_shouto) d sit behind a curtain of lilac colored leaves , hiding from his ($_shouto) father , his ($_shouto) attendants , anyone who wanted to pull him ($_shouto) back to the training grounds , to the study , to the throne room . He ($_shouto) would make little sculptures out of ice . A favorite of his ($_shouto) had always been butterflies , with paper thin wings that glittered in the sunlight . He ($_shouto) also liked cats , rabbits , sometimes swans . Eventually he ($_shouto) couldn t hide any longer and would put the sculptures in the flowerbed to melt into the soil . At least he ($_shouto) understood the butterflies now . 
"
14783729,3,14,"Shouto ($_shouto) started hoping he ($_shouto) d happen across Izuku ($_izuku) as he ($_shouto) was going about his ($_shouto) day . He ($_shouto) d look at he ($_shouto) guards he ($_shouto) d pass , hoping to see green curls and freckles but was so far unlucky . 
"
14783729,3,15,"When he ($_shouto) did see Izuku ($_izuku) , he ($_shouto) was walking to the stables with Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) . She liked to go for longer rides around the castle grounds and Shouto ($_shouto) wanted to join her . By the stables , Izuku ($_izuku) stood with Momo ($_momo) , obviously trying his ($_izuku) best to stay at attention as she talked . He ($_izuku) was so focused , nodding along to her instructions and gesturing with his ($_izuku) hands when he ($_izuku) talked . 
"
14783729,3,16,"Momo ($_momo) saw them first . She bowed , then waved at them . 
"
14783729,3,17,"Princess Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) ! Lovely day today isn t it ? She asked . 
"
14783729,3,18,"It really is . A perfect day for a ride around the grounds ! Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) said , taking a glance at Shouto ($_shouto) . 
"
14783729,3,19,"Hey Momo ($_momo) . 
"
14783729,3,20,"Hey yourself , Prince . Momo ($_momo) said , Stay out of trouble . 
"
14783729,3,21,"She winked and if she were closer by she d probably punch him ($_izuku) in the arm playfully . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) s twinkling laugh carried and Shouto ($_shouto) finally was able to meet Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes . Izuku ($_izuku) seemed to chance a smile , eyes flitting to the oversized red boots on his ($_izuku) feet . Shouto ($_shouto) felt his ($_shouto) cheeks burn , and he ($_shouto) hoped he ($_shouto) wasn t actually blushing . He ($_shouto) held his ($_shouto) hand up in a small wave , and it took a moment for Izuku ($_izuku) look up to return the gesture . 
"
14783729,3,22,"Then he ($_shouto) turned away , and Shouto ($_shouto) thought it best he ($_shouto) do the same . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) leaned over and whispered to ask if he ($_shouto) knew Izuku ($_izuku) , and he ($_shouto) responded with a shrug . 
"
14783729,3,23,"
"
14783729,3,24,"So Shouto ($_shouto) went to Ochako ($_ochako) s cottage , telling those that it ($_shouto) concerned that he ($_shouto) needed to pick up his ($_shouto) burn ointment , lest he ($_shouto) get in trouble for sneaking around . He ($_shouto) knocked on the old wooden door , waiting for a moment before it opened . 
"
14783729,3,25,"Your Highness ! Ochako ($_ochako) said brightly , her ($_ochako) pink cheeks glowing with warmth , What brings you here today ? 
"
14783729,3,26,"The usual. Shouto ($_shouto) said , And I need a favor from you . 
"
14783729,3,27,"Ochako ($_ochako) blinked , obviously thrown off , but she ($_ochako) smiled , Of course , Your Highness . 
"
14783729,3,28,"Shouto ($_shouto) pulled a small piece of parchment from his ($_shouto) tunic and handed it to her ($_ochako) . It was folded in three , sealed with a red wax seal imprinted with a snowflake . 
"
14783729,3,29,"Please give this to Izuku . he ($_shouto) said , Will you see him ($_shouto) soon ? 
"
14783729,3,30,"I ll probably see him ($_shouto) later this evening . she ($_ochako) said , I ll be happy to pass this along . 
"
14783729,3,31,"She ($_ochako) took the letter in her ($_ochako) hands , tucking it into the pocket of her ($_ochako) apron . 
"
14783729,3,32,"I m sure he ($_shouto) ll be really happy to hear from you . Tsuyu said . She ($_ochako) d been in the corner of the cottage , sitting by the fire and stirring a large cast iron pot filled with an herbal-smelling broth . 
"
14783729,3,33,"Shouto ($_shouto) s heart did a little jump in his ($_shouto) chest , but he ($_shouto) didn t let his ($_shouto) face betray that . 
"
14783729,3,34,"Ochako ($_ochako) giggled . 
"
14783729,3,35,"He ($_shouto) was just saying the other day how he ($_shouto) hoped to see you again . she ($_ochako) said , a hint of teasing in her ($_ochako) voice . 
"
14783729,3,36,"Shouto ($_shouto) felt his ($_shouto) face grow hot , Did he ($_shouto) ? 
"
14783729,3,37,"Yep , sure was ! Ochako ($_ochako) nodded before turning to a shelf behind her ($_ochako) and grabbing a small jar made of dark grey glass sealed with a copper lid . 
"
14783729,3,38,"I ll give him ($_shouto) your note . Ochako ($_ochako) said , holding out the jar , And here s your medicine . 
"
14783729,3,39,"He thanked her ($_ochako) , ducking under the dried herbs that hung from the ceiling in their neat little bundles of twine on his way to the door when he felt a warm but strong grip on his upper arm . He flinched on instinct , and Ochako ($_ochako) pulled her ($_ochako) hand back . He turned to meet her ($_ochako) steady gaze . 
"
14783729,3,40,"Please be good to Deku . she ($_ochako) said , If you re using him for anything taking advantage of his feelings I promise I will do something about it . 
"
14783729,3,41,"Her ($_ochako) threat was so calm it didn t even seem like a threat , in fact her ($_ochako) tone suggested worry . Her ($_ochako) boldness humbled Shouto ($_shouto) , as clearly she ($_ochako) wasn t afraid of him ($_shouto) even with the title he ($_shouto) held , and that was admirable . 
"
14783729,3,42,"Shouto ($_shouto) kept his ($_shouto) eyes on hers ($_shouto) , hoping his ($_shouto) own sincerity was readable . Tsuyu stood up , her ($_ochako) webbed hands twitching by her ($_ochako) side . But Shouto ($_shouto) simply bowed his ($_shouto) head , dropping his ($_shouto) shoulders in humility . 
"
14783729,3,43,"I give you my word . Shouto ($_shouto) said , I wouldn t dream of hurting him ($_shouto) . 
"
14783729,3,44,"He ($_shouto) meant it . He ($_shouto) d never hurt anyone , if he ($_shouto) could help it , least of all Izuku . He ($_shouto) wasn t his ($_shouto) father , no matter how much his ($_shouto) father wanted him ($_shouto) to be . 
"
14783729,3,45,"I ll hold you to that . Ochako ($_ochako) said , and Shouto ($_shouto) raised his ($_shouto) eyes to meet hers ($_ochako) , their usual mirth hidden behind a protective gaze that had Shouto a little nervous . 
"
14783729,3,46,"As well you should . He ($_shouto) said . 
"
14783729,3,47,"
"
14783729,3,48,"The note was an invitation to meet again at sunset the next night , the same place as before . Shouto ($_shouto) had been anxious about it all day , second guessing whether Izuku ($_izuku) would even want to meet with him ($_shouto) again . He ($_shouto) had to hold in the sigh of relief when he ($_shouto) saw Izuku ($_izuku) emerge from around a hedge . 
"
14783729,3,49,"He ($_shouto) was still in his ($_shouto) guard uniform , minus the thick leather vest . The white undershirt looked a little baggy on him ($_shouto) when untucked from the dark green pants . Shouto ($_shouto) felt a little relieved that he ($_shouto) wasn t wearing the Todoroki family crest . 
"
14783729,3,50,"Hi Shouto ($_shouto) . Izuku ($_izuku) greeted with a small , friendly wave , a shy smile on his ($_izuku) face . Shouto ($_shouto) smiled back . 
"
14783729,3,51,"Hi. He ($_shouto) said , awkwardly . 
"
14783729,3,52,"Neither of them were in sleep clothes this time , it felt more formal and therefore weird . They fidgeted for a moment , silent , waiting for the other to say something . 
"
14783729,3,53,"You seem tense . Shouto ($_shouto) observed , Are you alright ? 
"
14783729,3,54,"Izuku ($_izuku) pressed his ($_izuku) bandaged fingers together and looked at his ($_izuku) shoes . 
"
14783729,3,55,"I m fine . He ($_izuku) said . 
"
14783729,3,56,"Shouto ($_shouto) just nodded , Ah , that s good . He ($_izuku) felt deflated . Maybe this would be too weird after all . After all , what was there to say ? 
"
14783729,3,57,"The warm evening breeze ruffled Izuku ($_izuku) s hair , and he ($_izuku) tucked a few curls behind his ($_izuku) ear before looking at Shouto ($_shouto) with a grin . 
"
14783729,3,58,"I was able to control my magic better today . Izuku ($_izuku) offered , sitting down on the small stone wall that separated two sections of the grounds , It s been tough , but now I think I can fight better . 
"
14783729,3,59,"Then he ($_izuku) blanched , a nervous laugh escaping him ($_izuku) . 
"
14783729,3,60,"Maybe you don t want to hear that considering I m supposed to guard you . 
"
14783729,3,61,"Shouto ($_shouto) let out a soft huff from his ($_shouto) nose , almost a laugh , It ($_shouto) s fine . he ($_shouto) said . He ($_shouto) sat next to Izuku , not really realizing how close he ($_shouto) d decided to get . Their thighs touched , but neither moved . 
"
14783729,3,62,"Izuku ($_izuku) continued on this topic , talking about the guard . 
"
14783729,3,63,"I always wanted to join , ever since I was little . My brother , though we aren t really related , he told me I couldn t. Izuku ($_izuku) said , He always made fun of me , for everything . I was a loser who d just take notes on magic , but would never be able to cast . 
"
14783729,3,64,"That s awful . Shouto ($_shouto) could relate , in an odd way , He ($_shouto) seems like a terrible brother . 
"
14783729,3,65,"Yeah , he ($_shouto) always said I ($_i) d amount to nothing . Or that I ($_i) d just have to settle as a farmhand 
"
14783729,3,66,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked at him ($_shouto) , You ($_shouto) certainly proved him ($_shouto) wrong . 
"
14783729,3,67,"Yeah , and he ($_shouto) s not happy about it . He ($_shouto) hates being wrong about as much as he ($_shouto) hates to lose . 
"
14783729,3,68,"Turns out Katsuki ($_katsuki) was also on the guard , although he ($_katsuki) was usually not in the same vicinity as Izuku ($_izuku) , since he ($_katsuki) had the tendency to lose focus otherwise . Captain Nishiya quickly learned that they couldn t be around each other for too long . 
"
14783729,3,69,"What about you ($_shouto) ? You ($_shouto) have a sister right ? The princess ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked , swinging his ($_izuku) legs . 
"
14783729,3,70,"I have three siblings . I m the youngest . Shouto ($_shouto) said . 
"
14783729,3,71,"Izuku ($_izuku) giggled , Then you ($_shouto) 're the baby of the family ! 
"
14783729,3,72,"Shouto ($_shouto) blushed . He ($_shouto) was twenty and therefore an adult , but it wasn t like the phrase baby brother was rare amongst his ($_shouto) siblings . 
"
14783729,3,73,"The only one he ($_shouto) saw frequently was Fuyumi_,_who_still_lived_at_the_castle_with_him ($_fuyumi) him ($_shouto) . She ($_fuyumi) was second oldest and easily had the most powerful magic . She ($_fuyumi) could summon blizzards and create beautiful snowflakes , she ($_fuyumi) was winter itself and all of its beauty . If anyone should be ruler of a kingdom it would be her ($_fuyumi) , kind but powerful . But she ($_fuyumi) didn t have their father s magic , so she ($_fuyumi) d been tossed aside like the other older siblings . 
"
14783729,3,74,"The oldest had defected , his ($_natsuo) whereabouts unknown and his ($_natsuo) name changed , and the second youngest , Natsuo ($_natsuo) , had been born without an affinity and therefore had been neglected the most . He ($_natsuo) went to live with their mother in exile and pursue his ($_natsuo) studies . Shouto ($_shouto) envied that , in his ($_shouto) own way . 
"
14783729,3,75,"Izuku ($_izuku) listened to him ($_shouto) carefully , Shouto ($_shouto) felt almost shy under such intent concentration . But he ($_shouto) kept talking , slowly , and was grateful when Izuku ($_izuku) would jump in every now and again . 
"
14783729,3,76,"They went on to the subject of food , and from there many other tangents that made them lose track of where each conversation ended and began . Night had long since fallen , warm but with a breeze to cut the humidity . 
"
14783729,3,77,"I ll see you ? Izuku ($_izuku) seemed bashful all of the sudden as they were finally parting ways . 
"
14783729,3,78,"Soon. Shouto ($_shouto) finished , Sleep well , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
14783729,3,79,"You - you too ! Izuku ($_izuku) managed to squeak out , hesitating a moment , eyes on Shouto ($_shouto) . Then he ($_izuku) waved and said a final goodbye before disappearing among the manicured hedges that made a sort of labyrinth around the grounds . Shouto ($_shouto) took a moment , collecting himself ($_shouto) , before he ($_izuku) headed back to the castle . 
"
14783729,3,80,"It became routine , an arrangement of sorts , to meet up when they could . Shouto ($_shouto) looked forward to it ($_shouto) . They were rare moments of complete calm , times where he ($_izuku) felt like he ($_izuku) d found happiness in a place he ($_izuku) previously thought to be miserable through and through . 
"
14783729,3,81,"Shouto ($_shouto) would look out the window to the while he ($_shouto) studied , liking to think that he ($_shouto) could see where Izuku ($_izuku) was . When his ($_shouto) his_father ($_shouto) lashed a tongue of fire at him ($_shouto) as part of training , he ($_shouto) d think that later that night he ($_shouto) could lean on Izuku s shoulder and listen to him ($_shouto) talk about whatever he ($_shouto) wanted . It didn t make it better , but it helped him ($_shouto) see light at the end of a very bleak darkness . 
"
14783729,3,82,"What did you do to yourself this time ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked one evening , taking Izuku ($_izuku) s bandaged hand in both of his ($_izuku) . Often when Izuku ($_izuku) met up with him ($_izuku) , bruised and battered from the day , Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_izuku) worrying over him ($_izuku) . If Izuku ($_izuku) hated it he ($_izuku) he ($_izuku) never said so . 
"
14783729,3,83,"Just what normally happens. Izuku ($_izuku) said with a shrug . He ($_izuku) must know how bad that sounds . 
"
14783729,3,84,"It s not good that it s normal . Shouto ($_shouto) replied . 
"
14783729,3,85,"Izuku ($_izuku) just made a noncommittal noise , shrugging his ($_izuku) concern off , as he ($_izuku) does frustratingly often . He ($_izuku) didn t want to burden others with concern , is what Shouto ($_shouto) had gathered . He ($_izuku) d rather carry that weight on his ($_izuku) own shoulders . 
"
14783729,3,86,"Good to see you too , Shouto ($_shouto) . he ($_izuku) said wryly , smiling at him ($_izuku) . 
"
14783729,3,87,"Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes stayed on the bandages around Izuku ($_izuku) s arm , even when his ($_izuku) lips twitched into a little smile . The air was cool against his ($_izuku) face , crisp with the end of summer . 
"
14783729,3,88,"The weather is changing . Shouto ($_shouto) said , We probably can t meet when it gets too cold . 
"
14783729,3,89,"No , Izuku ($_izuku) shook his ($_izuku) head , curls bouncing , I m trying to think of what to do . 
"
14783729,3,90,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked toward the tall stone towers of the castle that loomed overhead , I ($_i) wonder if I ($_i) could get you in ... 
"
14783729,3,91,"I ($_i) don t know about that . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
"
14783729,3,92,"I m serious . If I ($_i) requested a personal guard for my ($_i) quarters and had it be you Shouto ($_shouto) thought aloud , something he ($_shouto) really only did with Izuku around . 
"
14783729,3,93,"That s risky . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
"
14783729,3,94,"I ($_i) know , that s why I ($_i) haven t done it . Shouto wasn t stupid , even if he ($_shouto) was impulsive . And he ($_shouto) wasn t nearly as impulsive as Izuku ($_izuku) . 
"
14783729,3,95,"Izuku ($_izuku) sighed , I ($_i) can t bring you back to the guards quarters . 
"
14783729,3,96,"I ($_i) guess we ll figure something out . I ($_i) don t think I ($_i) could stay cooped up in a castle all winter and not see you . Shouto ($_shouto) said , hoping that didn t come off too strong . 
"
14783729,3,97,"I ($_i) I ($_i) d miss you . Izuku ($_izuku) said lamely , but Shouto ($_shouto) felt warmed . 
"
14783729,3,98,"It s It makes me ($_i) feel better to hear that . Not that I ($_i) want you to miss me ($_i) , I ($_i) d rather you not have to . I ($_i) don t want to miss you either . Shouto ($_shouto) rambled awkwardly . 
"
14783729,3,99,"I ($_i) get what you mean . he ($_shouto) said . 
"
14783729,3,100,"Shouto ($_shouto) set his ($_shouto) cold hand on Izuku ($_izuku) s bandaged one . 
"
14783729,3,101,"Where does it hurt most ? 
"
14783729,3,102,"Ah! My ($_i) wrist . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
"
14783729,3,103,"Shouto s hand was ice cold as he ($_shouto) called his ($_shouto) magic to it , pressing his ($_shouto) palm to the side of Izuku ($_izuku) s bandaged wrist .

14783729,3,104,"Your magic is wonderful . Izuku ($_izuku) said . 
"
14783729,3,105,"Shouto ($_shouto) liked the way Izuku said that . Wonderful. Like it was something to behold , not a tool , not a weapon . 
"
14783729,3,106,"Yours is incredible too . He ($_shouto) said simply . He ($_shouto) d seen it , in short bursts . It was unlike anything he ($_shouto) d ever seen , a power that Izuku ($_izuku) could call to his ($_izuku) whole body , light he ($_izuku) could manipulate and that ran in veins of purple over his ($_izuku) skin . 
"
14783729,3,107,"It s incredible I even have it . Izuku ($_izuku) sounded oddly sarcastic and Shouto ($_shouto) wasn t sure what to make of that .

14783729,3,108,"You ll get there , magic isn t the same for everyone . 
"
14783729,3,109,"Izuku ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) head away , Well you have an amazing affinity that s so natural to you . I can t help but be jealous .

14783729,3,111,"When will I see you use your fire ? He ($_izuku) asked . 
"
14783729,3,112,"Never. Shouto ($_shouto) said a little too casually , conviction lying just under the surface that he ($_shouto) d kept for a long time .

"
14783729,3,115,"It absolutely is . Izuku ($_izuku) was starting to sound like he ($_izuku) was pleading , in an odd way , You re not your father , and you ll never be your father .

It must be hard with what you ve gone through . He ($_izuku) wrapped his ($_izuku) arms around Shouto ($_shouto) s torso , burying his ($_izuku) face into his ($_izuku) shoulder .
