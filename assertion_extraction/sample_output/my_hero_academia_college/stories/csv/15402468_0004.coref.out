"
15402468,4,2,"Uraraka ($_uraraka) , why are you ($_uraraka) running through the halls ! She ($_izuku) skidded to a stop . 
"
15402468,4,3,"Sorry Iid She ($_izuku) began . 
"
15402468,4,4,"It is improper to act in such a manor in the castle . Iida ($_iida) went on a small rant about the proper behaviour , Uraraka ($_uraraka) loved him ($_iida) as a friend , she ($_izuku) did , but when he ($_iida) go like this Iida could get a little over baring . 
"
15402468,4,5,"Izuku ($_izuku) had noticed Uraraka ($_uraraka) was no longer following him ($_iida) , he ($_izuku) huffed lightly , he ($_izuku) didn t say their chasing game was over . He ($_izuku) bound back down the hall to see someone talking to her ($_izuku) , then saw the look on Uraraka ($_uraraka) s face . She ($_izuku) didn t want to listen to him ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) huffed again and ran at the other person , colliding with their legs . 
"
15402468,4,6,"Iida ($_iida) crashed to the ground , and before he ($_iida) could get up , Izuku ($_izuku) jumped onto his ($_iida) chest and growled at him ($_iida) . 
"
15402468,4,7,"Izuku ($_izuku) ! Uraraka ($_uraraka) gasped . Izuku ($_izuku) looked at her ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) looked back at Iida ($_iida) and growled once more , before jumping on to_Uraraka ($_uraraka) s shoulders . I was trying to explain I am looking after Izuku ($_izuku) and I was chasing after him ($_izuku) . She ($_izuku) explained to Iida as he ($_izuku) got up . 
"
15402468,4,8,"Oh , I see . I apologise then . . He ($_izuku) bowed . Uraraka ($_uraraka) sighed and smiled . 
"
15402468,4,9,"And you shouldn t go running into people Izuku ($_izuku) . She ($_izuku) added , Izuku ($_izuku) snorted . 
"
15402468,4,10,"He ($_izuku) interrupted our game . Izuku ($_izuku) pouted , rest his ($_izuku) head against her ($_izuku) cheek . Uraraka ($_uraraka) smiled and pet his ($_uraraka) head . 
"
15402468,4,11,"How about we go outside to play ? No one will bother us out there . Uraraka ($_uraraka) suggested . Or , we can ask the King with I can take you into the main town , and I can introduce you to some more of my friends . 
"
15402468,4,12,"I think that is a wonderful idea . The knight in training , apprience mage , and dragon hatchling looked up the hall . Toshinori ($_toshinori) was walking their way with Iida Tensei and Aizawa ($_aizawa) at his ($_aizawa) side . 
"
15402468,4,13,"Your majesty . Uraraka ($_uraraka) bowed her ($_uraraka) head , and smiled . Before glancing at Izuku ($_izuku) . So , do you want to see the_city_Izuku ($_izuku) ? The green hatchling leapt from her ($_uraraka) shoulder to the kings , amnd rubbed his head against his cheek , cooing softly , before jumping back to Uraraka . 
"
15402468,4,14,"Ready now. He said 
"
15402468,4,15,"You should go too Tenya . Tensei ($_tensei) told him 
"
15402468,4,16,"But Iida ($_iida) began 
"
15402468,4,17,"No buts , Knights should be approachable too . So go and make yourself a social life . Tensei ($_tensei) said 
"
15402468,4,18,"Mama and Papa ($_papa) said having friends makes you stronger . Izuku ($_izuku) cooed 
"
15402468,4,19,"Yeah! Come with us Iida ($_iida) ! Uraraka ($_uraraka) grabbed his ($_uraraka) arm and began to pull him ($_uraraka) along . Toshinori ($_toshinori) chuckled lightly as Tensei called after them , telling them to enjoy themselves . 
"
15402468,4,20,"Izuku ($_izuku) jumped from Uraraka ($_uraraka) to Iida , trying to get a look at everything the city had to offer . Uraraka ($_uraraka) giggled as the hatchling climbed onto Iida ($_iida) s head , looking around . Some of the people watched , with small smiles , some more sad then relief . Uraraka ($_uraraka) could understand . Forest dragons were the ones who kept the great forests alive , with only one life , he ($_uraraka) was the only one who could protect them now . And the fact he ($_uraraka) was just a hatchling , no chilc should have to lose their parents just for someone to prove their strength . 
"
15402468,4,21,"Izuku ($_izuku) , slow down . Everything will still be here tomorrow for you to have another look around . Uraraka ($_uraraka) told him ($_uraraka) , Izuku ($_izuku) looked at her ($_uraraka) .

"
15402468,4,23,"Really. This city is the biggest in the kingdom , everyone lives together , works together . We form one great , friendly society , we help each other out if we fall into times of need . Uraraka ($_uraraka) explained . Don t dragons live in family groups ? 
"
15402468,4,24,"We did , the forest dragons . A community like this . Mama ($_mama) told me that the omega s would help each other build their nests , whilst the Alpha s and Beta s would hunt for plants and seed to plant around them . Then they began to vanish , my_Papa ($_papa) was one of the first to vanish Izuku ($_izuku) lowered his ($_izuku) gaze . Mama ($_mama) said we had to leave the nest to go to the dragons lands , and how we would be safe once we got there but then the human king of fire and death appeared A small growl erupted from his throat . I could smell the blood of my kin upon him I knew they were gone . Like with_my_Mama ($_mama) , the forest cried out for their lives . 
"
15402468,4,25,"Would it be possible for us to get you to the dragon lands ? Uraraka ($_uraraka) asked 
"
15402468,4,26,"No , hatchlings are taught the way by their parents , whilst I hatched in the dragon lands , This was to be my first journey to the area . Izuku ($_izuku) explained 
"
15402468,4,27,"Well , when you are older , we would be happy to assist you in looking for it . Iida ($_iida) said . Izuku ($_izuku) chirped happily in reply .

"
15402468,4,34,"Pleasure to meet you Izuku ($_izuku) . Tsu ($_tsu) greeted , then held out a rose for him ($_izuku) . Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes gleamed as he ($_izuku) quickly ate it .
