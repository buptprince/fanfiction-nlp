12740715,4,1,"Kirishima Eijirou is not a bad person . 
"
12740715,4,2,"Of course , he ($_iida) s not really a good person either , but that doesn t really matter . What matters is , although he ($_iida) may steal , he ($_iida) s not horrible . He ($_iida) gives everything he ($_iida) takes to the people who need it , after all . So , yeah , he ($_iida) s always considered himself ($_iida) a good person , but something about the company makes him ($_iida) doubt himself ($_iida) . 
"
12740715,4,3,"First of all , there s Midoriya ($_midoriya) . At first , he ($_iida) s nothing to behold , but the way he ($_iida) reacted when Iida ($_iida) was thrown into sea was the most manly thing Kirishima ($_kirishima) had ever seen . He ($_iida) recalls having to hold Midoriya ($_midoriya) back from jumping in after the_knight ($_iida) , and he ($_iida) frowns lightly . Sure , he ($_iida) d have done the same if he ($_iida) knew the guy , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) had just tried to sacrifice himself ($_iida) for a total stranger . If anything makes Kirishima ($_kirishima) feel insecure , it ($_kirishima) s that . 
"
12740715,4,4,"And then , of course , there was Iida ($_iida) s heroic return . Seriously , how could he ($_iida) not feel inferior to the knight when he ($_iida) had that feeling of immense power around him ($_iida) ? He ($_iida) won t allow himself ($_iida) to feel inferior just because Iida ($_iida) had gotten a magical artifact and he ($_iida) hadn t yet , because he ($_iida) isn t that selfish . 
"
12740715,4,5,"Besides , there was one thing he ($_iida) already had that some others didn t. Friends . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s taken a liking to the crazy boy , Bakugou , the cursed one , Ashido , but mostly his ($_iida) eyes have been on the bard . Kaminari Denki isn t much , really , he ($_iida) s kind of stupid , but he ($_iida) has this ability to lighten the mood whenever the conversation gets too serious . He ($_iida) s probably the reason Kirishima isn t wallowing in self pity like he ($_iida) normally would have if he ($_iida) were surrounded by such amazing people . 
"
12740715,4,6,"In their current spot in the middle of the hallway , Kaminari ($_kaminari) is telling a story that Kirishima ($_kirishima) has just zoned out of on accident , and he ($_ashido) tries to tune back in only to find that he ($_ashido) s totally lost and can t follow what s happening . To his ($_ashido) right , Ashido ($_ashido) listens intently , leaning forward ever so slightly , though he ($_ashido) can see her ($_ashido) stealing glances at the serious prince s advisor . To his ($_ashido) left , Bakugou ($_bakugou) tries to make it look like he ($_ashido) s not paying attention even though he ($_ashido) clearly is , which makes Kirishima ($_kirishima) have to bite back laughter . 
"
12740715,4,7,"He ($_ashido) gives up on trying to focus eventually , leaning back against the wall and crossing his ($_ashido) legs at the ankles as he ($_ashido) tries to think about something other than his ($_ashido) self-pity . 
"
12740715,4,8,"He ($_ashido) wasn t successful , but at least he ($_ashido) hadn t let it get to him ($_ashido) too much . By the_time_everyone ($_ashido) is standing up again , he ($_ashido) s just finished with his ($_ashido) small pity session , so he ($_ashido) gets up and stretches . We settin off again ? he ($_ashido) asks , to nobody in particular . Midoriya ($_midoriya) is the one who answers , as their unofficial leader . 
"
12740715,4,9,"Yeah. . It s probably better to go as fast as we can , since we don t know how much time we have to light the fire . Plus , if all of the challenges are that easy , we ll be able to get past them in no time ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins at that ($_kirishima) . That ($_kirishima) s the kind of manly spirit he ($_kirishima) likes to see in someone leading him ($_kirishima) . He ($_kirishima) nudges Kaminari with his ($_kirishima) foot , as the bard has fallen asleep against the wall . The_boy ($_kirishima) wakes with a start , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) laughs at him ($_kirishima) . He ($_kirishima) d feel bad if it weren t as funny as it is . 
"
12740715,4,10,"Ey , come on , we re going to the next challenge . He ($_kirishima) says the next challenge vaguely as if he ($_kirishima) doesn t know it s the Fire Banquet . Everyone knows what the challenges are , so Kirishima ($_kirishima) really doesn t know why he ($_kirishima) didn t just say it directly . Who knows? You could get those_Gauntlets ($_the) . I hear they re super powerful . Well , that definitely gets Kaminari ($_kaminari) to stand up . If he ($_kirishima) were someone like Iida ($_iida) , he ($_kirishima) might accuse the bard of being selfish , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) wants that power just as much as anybody else for his ($_kirishima) own reasons , so he ($_kirishima) s not really in any place to speak . 
"
12740715,4,11,"You seriously think so ? I_du ($_du) n no , maybe they ($_du) re Bakugou s. He ($_kirishima) s kind of a hothead . Kirishima ($_kirishima) gets the joke right as Bakugou ($_bakugou) starts to yell , and he ($_kirishima) snorts . Kaminari ($_kaminari) looks terrified , probably because he ($_kirishima) s the one that just ticked Bakugou ($_bakugou) off . 
"
12740715,4,12,"Don t act like you weren t expecting that , Kirishima ($_kirishima) replies , and Kaminari ($_kaminari) scowls . They ve known each other for maybe an hour , but they ve all sort of picked up on each other s behavior . Come on , anyone would get mad at you if you described them with a bad pun . That was a total lie , but it seemed to work . 
"
12740715,4,13,"Kirishima doesn t carry on a conversation as everyone gets themselves situated . Kaminari ($_kaminari) and Ashido ($_ashido) get into a conversation about who they think will get the_Gauntlets ($_the) , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) can t ignore the fluttering in his ($_kaminari) chest when Kaminari ($_kaminari) says Kirishima ($_kirishima) would probably be a good fit for them . Then they start walking , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) doesn t yet let that small moment go . 
"
12740715,4,14,"He ($_kaminari) lags behind with Bakugou ($_bakugou) as they walk , elbowing him ($_kaminari) the side and saying , If you glare any harder at Midoriya ($_midoriya) you re probably gon na burn holes in the back of his ($_kaminari) head . What d he ($_kaminari) ever do ? He ($_kaminari) knows it s a dangerous question to ask to the fiery boy , but he ($_kaminari) s not afraid of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s temper because he ($_kaminari) s guessed that it s usually all bark and no bite . 
"
12740715,4,15,"He ($_kaminari) fucking exists . Normally , that s something Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , but with more sarcasm . Bakugou ($_bakugou) is literally seething . That kind of makes Kirishima ($_kirishima) afraid , the idea that Bakugou ($_bakugou) is capable of hating someone so much that he ($_kaminari) can t even keep it in . Stupid fucking Deku . I was always better than him ($_kaminari) at everything and now he ($_kaminari) s the fucking Bearer . / I / deserved to be the Bearer , goddammit ! And , well , Kirishima ($_kirishima) laughs . 
"
12740715,4,16,"Isn t the bearer supposed to be someone calm and rational ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) looks at him ($_kaminari) with a murderous glare , but he ($_kaminari) continues anyway . You might be rational , but you re the least calm person I have ever met . Then , of course , Bakugou ($_bakugou) starts yelling , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) ignores him ($_kaminari) in favor of focusing on what everyone else has already spotted . They re right in front of the Fire Banquet s doors . Somehow , this walk felt a lot shorter than the one to the Blooming Wave . 
"
12740715,4,17,"As Midoriya ($_midoriya) reaches out to the door like he ($_midoriya) did with the previous one , Kirishima ($_kirishima) feels a spike of anxiety and an incredible heat . Fire s more dangerous than water , so what if they all die here ? He ($_midoriya) doesn t want to be remembered as Kirishima Eijirou , the company member who died . 
"
12740715,4,18,"There s not really much time to worry as the heat intensifies and his ($_midoriya) vision is filled with orange and red . 
"
12740715,4,19,"Next Challenge : The Fire Banquet .
