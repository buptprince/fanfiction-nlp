Kirishima ($_kirishima) didn t offer any assistance , she was out of the nursery and needed to learn she could do things for herself . She cried out in disgust and delight as the small fish flopped on the riverbed . Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled and gestured for her along with the others to watch . He ($_kirishima) grabbed the fish preventing it from getting injured .

So , it can go big , have many babies , and then one day you ll catch it again . He ($_kirishima) promised . He ($_kirishima) reached out and took her hand and guided it to the fish . Hurry , we need to take out the hook . 
"
14753735,2,7,"The little girl was hesitant to touch the fish but Kirishima ($_kirishima) encourage her gently , but his eyes averted upwards . Someone was approaching from upwind . He was certain that it was Aizawa and his muscles relaxed . Bend the hook Kirishima instructed as he kept his eyes towards the council member . And push it back through

14753735,2,9,"The other children surrounded the little omega girl and cheered as she placed the fish in the water and it swim away . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stood up and met Aizawa ($_aizawa) half way . He ($_kirishima) kept an eye on the pups , although the magical borders kept them safe from other tribes there were still many other dangers for ones so little . 
"
14753735,2,10,"You re needed in the village . Aizawa ($_aizawa) eyes drifted to the children . They were chatting excitedly about the fish , some of them were sticking out their lips to mimic the fish she had caught .

"
14753735,2,14,"Kirishima lungs burnt by the time he ($_aizawa) reached the village . He ($_aizawa) sniffed the air and his ($_aizawa) feet begun to move towards the scent of the_Alpha ($_the) , breaking into a sprint again he ($_aizawa) leaped into Chiyo s hut like a wild animal . Izuku ($_izuku) reacted immediately when the hut was breached . He ($_izuku) stepped into the intruder grabbing his ($_izuku) shoulders . He ($_izuku) turned and stepped away from him ($_izuku) while at the same time pulling him ($_izuku) towards him ($_izuku) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was off balance now , Izuku ($_izuku) had him ($_izuku) by the arm and knew from their sparring that this wasn t a good position .

"
14753735,2,19,"You are the fool that was planted on his ($_kirishima) back Izuku countered , his ($_kirishima) eyes soften and shook his ($_kirishima) head . Kirishima ($_kirishima) grinned and quickly got to his ($_kirishima) feet . He ($_kirishima) buried his ($_kirishima) nose into the crook of his ($_kirishima) neck , Izuku ($_izuku) always smelled good but being so close to his ($_kirishima) heat made him ($_kirishima) especially alluring . In a month maybe less Izuku ($_izuku) would go into heat , it was driving him ($_kirishima) mad . He ($_kirishima) kissed right where his ($_kirishima) scent gland was and then rubbed against him ($_kirishima) . He ($_kirishima) really liked when Izuku ($_izuku) smelled like him ($_kirishima) but Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t in the mood for scenting and pushed him ($_kirishima) away .

"
14753735,2,24,"So , your first reaction was too run in here like a mad dog ? Izuku ($_izuku) put his ($_izuku) hands on his ($_izuku) hips To protect me ? 
"
14753735,2,25,"Of course not . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rubbed the back of his ($_kirishima) head . I wanted to see the fight maybe join in . 
"
14753735,2,26,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes darted between the two . He ($_bakugou) had no idea what the hell was going on . The red hair one had charged into the hut like he ($_bakugou) was going into battle . When he ($_bakugou) breached the door way he ($_bakugou) smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) but now his ($_bakugou) scent resembled more of a beta and that green hair omega had flipped him ($_bakugou) like it was nothing . That wasn t luck , that was strength and training . 
"
14753735,2,27,"What the fuck 
"
14753735,2,28,"Kirishima and Izuku ($_izuku) both turned and looked down at the_Alpha ($_the) . Kirishima cheeks went pink and he ($_bakugou) scratched the back of his ($_bakugou) head . I didn t expect him ($_bakugou) to be so manly looking . He ($_bakugou) whispered .

"
14753735,2,31,"Oh , my gods ! Izuku ($_izuku) pushed Kirishima ($_kirishima) out the hut . Go find out what Aizawa ($_aizawa) wanted 
"
14753735,2,32,"You two bonded ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) inquired . The red headed beta had been very touchy feeling with the_Omega ($_the) . . 
"
14753735,2,33,"No . Izuku ($_izuku) folded his ($_izuku) arms . Kirishima ($_kirishima) is overly affectionate . He ($_izuku) cleared his ($_izuku) throat . And I had extended the offer to share my heat with him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) s eager . 
"
14753735,2,34,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) blushed , he ($_izuku) wasn t used to Omega s speaking so openly about their heats . Omega s have nothing to offer , everything they have is taken . 
"
14753735,2,35,"Not here. Izuku ($_izuku) muttered and he ($_izuku) became more guarded . Although the_Alpha ($_the) was injured he ($_izuku) came from a world by his ($_izuku) own account that Omegas were owned and held no rights . He ($_izuku) couldn t trust him ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) couldn t let himself ($_izuku) forget what he ($_izuku) was .

"
14753735,2,37,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) along with Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to the hut nearly an hour later . Aizawa ($_aizawa) requested a word with Midoriya ($_midoriya) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) was left in his ($_kirishima) stead to watch the_Alpha ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) stepped outside the hut , he ($_kirishima) was thankful to get fresh air . The Alpha pheromones were starting to make his ($_kirishima) head hurt . 
"
14753735,2,38,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) will take over guarding the_Alpha ($_the) . 
"
14753735,2,39,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) is more likely going to try to befriend him ($_kirishima) than guard him ($_kirishima) ! Izuku ($_izuku) exclaimed . It was true that he ($_izuku) had extended the offer to share his ($_izuku) first heat with the Beta so obviously he ($_izuku) trusted him ($_izuku) , but he ($_izuku) knew his ($_izuku) short comings . He ($_izuku) was extremely curious and friendly unless provoked . 
"
14753735,2,40,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) placed his ($_aizawa) hand on Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulder and guided him ($_aizawa) away from the hut . He ($_aizawa) knew that Midoriya ($_midoriya) would likely resist this order . He ($_aizawa) was stubborn when he ($_aizawa) thought he ($_aizawa) was doing the right thing but there was more to this than Midoriya ($_midoriya) realized . 
"
14753735,2,41,"Izuku ($_izuku) glanced towards the hut where Kacchan was being held . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a capable warrior but he ($_aizawa) was far too trusting . His ($_aizawa) brow tightened but he ($_aizawa) allowed Aizawa ($_aizawa) guided him ($_aizawa) . 
"
14753735,2,42,"Leave Kirishima ($_kirishima) to his ($_aizawa) duty . You have your own He ($_aizawa) held open the door and Izuku ($_izuku) realized that they were in front of Aizawa ($_aizawa) personal hut . His ($_aizawa) hut was small and secluded , nestled against the mountain side . Aizawa ($_aizawa) was a private person and rarely entertained . He ($_aizawa) glanced up at the council member and with permission he ($_aizawa) stepped inside . Aizawa ($_aizawa) often left the safety of the village . He ($_aizawa) travelled far for trade and information and often bought back books and scrolls . Izuku ($_izuku) had read a great many , but there were a few that he ($_aizawa) was itching to get his ($_aizawa) hands on . 
"
14753735,2,43,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) walked past him ($_aizawa) and went to the corner of his ($_aizawa) hut . He ($_aizawa) tossed aside a few furs and grabbed a metal box . It appeared heavy as he ($_aizawa) lifted it and walked it towards him ($_aizawa) carefully . He ($_aizawa) set it on the ground at his ($_aizawa) feet and Izuku ($_izuku) instantly knelt beside it . 
"
14753735,2,44,"Inside was a single thick book that he ($_aizawa) has never seen before . He ($_aizawa) traced over the top of the book , it felt like a stone that had been washed smooth on the bottom of the river bed . The pages were made from parchments folded and sewn into strong cords that were attached to wooden boards . 
"
14753735,2,45,"Vellum ($_vellum) ? He ($_aizawa) glanced up at Aizawa ($_aizawa) and he ($_aizawa) nodded approvingly . Vellum ($_vellum) is made from the skin of a calf . It ($_vellum) is both smooth and durable . Izuku ($_izuku) has never seen one of this quality . The preparation was impeccable . This is old . Izuku ($_izuku) leaned down and sniffed at the pages . They finished it with by abrading the surface with pumice and a treatment of He ($_izuku) looked up and grinned Lime . 
"
14753735,2,46,"What of the cover ? Aizawa ($_aizawa) inquired . 
"
14753735,2,47,"Izuku ($_izuku) closed the book and his ($_izuku) fingers traced the outside again . It s hard like rock but smells like animal hide . I m not entirely sure . 
"
14753735,2,48,"Dragon_Aizawa ($_dragon) answer and knelt beside him ($_izuku) . I ($_dragon) want you to translate this there is a question you must answer . 
"
14753735,2,49,"And the question is in here ? Izuku ($_izuku) tilted his ($_izuku) head . He ($_izuku) had translated many books , he ($_izuku) had the vast knowledge of his ($_izuku) previous incarnations , but this language was old . He ($_izuku) had no memory of it . Some of his ($_izuku) past lives gave up their knowledge and experience willing , while others he ($_izuku) had to mediate and use the pipe to connect with and there were two he ($_izuku) has never spoken too . The first and the One for All before him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) couldn t connect to them , Aizawa ($_aizawa) believed it would take time but Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t sure that inexperience was the problem . 
"
14753735,2,50,"Yes , can you do it before your heat ? 
"
14753735,2,51,"Izuku ($_izuku) made a face . Something like this would takes months , he ($_izuku) had maybe a few weeks . He ($_izuku) did like a challenge and he ($_izuku) was curious about the question he ($_izuku) needed to answer within this book . Can I take this with me ? 
"
14753735,2,52,"Of course . In fact , I ll walk you to your mother s hut Aizawa ($_aizawa) offered . 
"
14753735,2,53,"He ($_izuku) had intended to stop by and make sure that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was treating the_Alpha ($_the) as the dangerous beast he ($_izuku) was and not a possible new friend and Aizawa ($_aizawa) must have known that . If you must Izuku ($_izuku) reached down and pick up the box that contain the book . 
"
14753735,2,54,"The two walked side by side . Izuku ($_izuku) s mother hut was on the opposite side of the village near the forest . The trees offered plenty of shade and protection and his mother enjoyed nature , although Izuku ($_izuku) had always speculated it was because she felt like an outsider , even after all this time . 
"
14753735,2,55,"Have you already translated this ? 
"
14753735,2,56,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) nodded . Do you not wish to do it ? His ($_aizawa) brow lifted and Izuku ($_izuku) shook his ($_aizawa) head . 
"
14753735,2,57,"It just seems like an important book just to be busy work . I know you don t want me too close to the Alpha this close to my heat , but this seems different . 
"
14753735,2,58,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) sighed That is a concern council shares , you have never been near a true Alpha but I don t have doubts about your ability to control your biology . Aizawa ($_aizawa) rubbed the back of the neck . And if he ($_aizawa) can t control his ($_aizawa) I know you are strong enough to prevent anything 
"
14753735,2,59,"Izuku ($_izuku) straightened his ($_izuku) posture , faith in his ($_izuku) abilities always made him ($_izuku) happy . Is it truly important the question in this book ? If you believe I can take care of myself shouldn t my duty be to protect this village continue first and foremost ? 
"
14753735,2,60,"I guess you will just have to translate it and find out yourself if it was worth it He ($_izuku) placed his ($_izuku) hand on his ($_izuku) shoulder . When you find this question don t think about your duty . I want you to think about as an Omega , as yourself and decide what your answer will be Aizawa turned , Izuku ($_izuku) s hut was only a few feet away . His ($_izuku) mother was outside stirring a pot that smelled like rabbit . If he ($_izuku) didn t leave he ($_izuku) would be invited to stay and he ($_izuku) wanted to avoid that at all cost . 
"
14753735,2,61,"Izuku ($_izuku) nodded , that had made him ($_izuku) more curious than ever , but he ($_izuku) had more pressing matters . He ($_izuku) set the book down and slowly approached his ($_izuku) mother . He ($_izuku) was careful not to step on a single twig or dried leaf as he ($_izuku) approached her from behind . 
"
14753735,2,62,"I could smell you the moment you returned to the village , Izuku ($_izuku) . Do you not think I could smell you right behind me ? She chuckled . Izuku ($_izuku) wrapped his ($_izuku) arms from behind around her and nuzzled into her neck . 
"
14753735,2,63,"Where did you get the rabbit ? 
"
14753735,2,64,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) claimed he ($_aizawa) caught too many again . She turned and reached up touching Izuku ($_izuku) s hair . Izuku ($_izuku) stood still as his ($_izuku) mother inspected him ($_izuku) . Her unseeing eyes never blinked as her hands gently touched his ($_izuku) face and examined his ($_izuku) neck . 
"
14753735,2,65,"I wasn t bitten Izuku muttered . I wouldn t let him ($_izuku) I mean he ($_izuku) didn t even try . He ($_izuku) s very hurt 
"
14753735,2,66,"I know She leaned up and kissed his ($_izuku) cheek . Please tell Aizawa ($_aizawa) next time that you see him ($_izuku) that he ($_izuku) s getting too thin and he ($_izuku) needs to stop pretending he ($_izuku) s such a great hunter and giving me his ($_izuku) catches . I am content with what I can gather on my own . 
"
14753735,2,67,"He ($_izuku) won t listen to me Izuku ($_izuku) leaned down and smelled the soup . 
"
14753735,2,68,"He ($_izuku) just feels guilty . She laughed . When we first met he ($_izuku) kicked me so hard . 
"
14753735,2,69,"Izuku brow wrinkle Why did you kick you . I thought he ($_izuku) found you and bought you here ? 
"
14753735,2,70,"Oh no . Inko ($_inko) stirred the pot and then tasted the soup . He ($_inko) gestured for Izuku ($_izuku) to fetch the bowls . He ($_inko) quickly did as she instructed and touched her hand gently so that she knew that bowl was right beneath her bowl . She poured them both some soup . Izuku ($_izuku) carried the bowls inside so that they could eat in peace . 
"
14753735,2,71,"Are you sure I never told you this ? Inko ($_inko) blew on the soup . She knew with winter setting in that there wasn t going to be much meat on the menu , so she wasn t so quick to refuse his offering .

"
14753735,2,73,"That it is but the moment you came into this world Izuku . It was worth it . Inko ($_inko) sipped the soup slowly . Aizawa ($_aizawa) did find me ($_inko) first but he ($_aizawa) didn t bring me ($_inko) here . I ($_inko) found this place on my ($_inko) own . 
"
14753735,2,74,"How the magical border repels anyone from just wondering upon it and you were pregnant how did you make it up the mountain ? 
"
14753735,2,75,"Inko ($_inko) shrugged her ($_inko) shoulders . Went I ($_inko) got away I ($_inko) was scarred and just ran . I ($_inko) always believed that it was a spirit or god . Maybe it was One for All guiding me ($_inko) . It lead me ($_inko) up this mountain and into the village I ($_inko) caused quite a scare . She ($_inko) laughed . Aizawa ($_aizawa) kicked me ($_inko) so hard I ($_inko) went into labor . He ($_aizawa) didn t realize I ($_inko) was a pregnant Omega , he ($_aizawa) just thought I ($_inko) was an intruder

He ($_izuku) bought it inside and set it beside his ($_izuku) mother . Feel the cover .
