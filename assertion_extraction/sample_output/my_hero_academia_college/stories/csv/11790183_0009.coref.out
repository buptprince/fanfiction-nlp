"
11790183,9,2,"Izuku ($_izuku) was the last to step foot outside the oboroguruma , his ($_izuku) sandal-clad feet clacking as he ($_izuku) walked about . Shouto ($_shouto) could not be any more pleased now that he ($_izuku) was free . It was , at its core , a bubbling heat that gathered just below Shouto ($_shouto) s skin . He ($_izuku) found he ($_izuku) was becoming well-acquainted with this feeling with the gnawing , the straining , the restlessness that rubbed his ($_izuku) senses raw . 
"
11790183,9,3,"Four_days ($_four) . Four_days ($_four) spent inside the oboroguruma where Shouto ($_shouto) took to ignoring its aimless chatter in favor of gazing out a window . A lone mountain side . A derelict village , its roofs long ago collapsed and its soil bearing darkened marks suspiciously patterned like splatters . He ($_izuku) would be lying to himself ($_izuku) which he ($_izuku) had come into the habit of , as of late if he ($_izuku) were to say it was of no interest to him ($_izuku) . At first glance , these things were nothing to take note of , but Shouto ($_shouto) needed something to busy himself ($_shouto) . His ($_shouto) thoughts twisted and contorted , buckled under the pressure of the images his ($_shouto) mind drew up . He ($_shouto) could picture a stretch of farmland once there . He ($_shouto) supposed it may have been lush with green or overrun with weeds , and if he ($_shouto) concentrated , he ($_shouto) thought he ($_shouto) could hear the patter of steps from children as they ran about in play . It wasn t healthy . Shouto ($_shouto) was well aware of this , but he ($_shouto) couldn t help seeing an empty home and wanting to stitch close the holes where life once seeped through , if only to give himself ($_shouto) something to do . 
"
11790183,9,4,"He ($_shouto) watched as the oboroguruma shook its head , sending its hair flying about . It requested payment , but when Tenya ($_tenya) stepped forward with Ochako ($_ochako) to offer it beads of gold , its lips stretched thin with flared nostrils . It eyed them wearily , but allowed them to lay the gold on its outstretched tongue before disappearing into the sky once more . 
"
11790183,9,5,"Shouto ($_shouto) heard Izuku ($_izuku) wince from behind him ($_shouto) . I think you ($_shouto) overpaid , Tenya ($_tenya) . Will you ($_shouto) have enough to get to where you ($_shouto) re going ? 
"
11790183,9,6,"Ochako ($_ochako) giggled behind a hand as she ($_ochako) nudged Tenya ($_tenya) with an elbow . 
"
11790183,9,7,"Shouto wasn t sure what he was initially expecting , but it certainly wasn t for Tenya ($_tenya) to shrug his shoulders and rub his nape , head down as though embarrassed . There s more than enough leaves around . 
"
11790183,9,8,"Izuku ($_izuku) laughed , and the clothes he ($_izuku) had in his ($_izuku) hands , gifts from the villagers , shifted and made to fall . When he ($_izuku) turned Shouto ($_shouto) saw the corner of Inko s mouth twitch before a small grin settled . That s an old trick , she ($_ochako) said , tone carrying a hint of chastisement . 
"
11790183,9,9,"I don t like it , Tenya ($_tenya) explained . I try not to do it often , but my brother insisted I learn . 
"
11790183,9,10,"He ($_izuku) laid out his ($_izuku) excuse , and the atmosphere shifted to welcome their collective laughter . Even Shouto ($_shouto) joined , nearly threw his ($_shouto) head back when he ($_shouto) trailed close enough to Izuku for their shoulders to bump together . 
"
11790183,9,11,"They stood together on an expanse of sunbaked dirt at the foot of a staircase which was carved into the side of a hill . Steep , each step was stacked one atop another in hurried succession . 
"
11790183,9,12,"Towering trees watched on either end of the stairs , and Shouto ($_shouto) thought he ($_shouto) could hear them speaking in hushed whispers . It was something like an invitation that beckoned him ($_shouto) to make his ($_shouto) way through their dense forest . Light . Airy . They spun for him ($_shouto) lies and empty promises that stuck like honey on his ($_shouto) tongue . They asked him ($_shouto) , begged him ($_shouto) , to feel the wind batter his ($_shouto) cheeks , to burrow his ($_shouto) bare toes into the soil and find their roots , to sprint along the petal-ridden waterway and meet the faced tree with no name . Come to us , he ($_shouto) heard . Here you can belong . 
"
11790183,9,13,"Unnerving as it was , it was also pleasing in a way Shouto couldn t place . He ($_shouto) supposed he ($_shouto) might have ventured a step their way , but Tenya ($_tenya) patted his ($_tenya) shoulder with his ($_tenya) free hand . The spell was only partially lifted , but even as he ($_tenya) went up the stairs after Ochako ($_ochako) and Izuku ($_izuku) , he ($_tenya) still heard their collective voice drone up the hill . They seemed to incline his ($_tenya) way with branches that closely resembled arms , mangled and ominous . 
"
11790183,9,14,"His ($_tenya) foot faltered over a step , but Tenya ($_tenya) rested a hand on the small of his ($_tenya) back to push him ($_tenya) forward . 
"
11790183,9,15,"Don t listen to them , he ($_tenya) said , voice low . He ($_tenya) kept his ($_tenya) head forward . Moidon ($_moidon) can tell you stories just as beautiful as any other tree spirit , but most will bestow curses before any blessings . If it ($_moidon) becomes too difficult to ignore , keep your head down . 
"
11790183,9,16,"Shouto ($_shouto) nodded . Though he ($_tenya) hadn t known him ($_tenya) long , Tenya ($_tenya) seemed wise and was most likely several human lifespans older than Shouto ($_shouto) . He ($_tenya) spoke in a voice laced with determination , and , though he ($_tenya) had little evidence to support it , Shouto ($_shouto) suspected he ($_tenya) snatched his ($_tenya) trust with the stealth and swiftness of a fox on the hunt . 
"
11790183,9,17,"His ($_tenya) advice , Shouto ($_shouto) discovered , was sound . He ($_tenya) kept his ($_tenya) head low and watched his ($_tenya) feet which proved to be a dull task , even if it kept him ($_tenya) safe from harm . Up , down , up , down , up , his ($_tenya) feet went : a monotonous cycle that threatened to repeat its course every other second . His ($_tenya) attention strayed off to whatever happened to flit within view . Whether it was a spot of erosion that left the surface uneven with depressions ; whether it was the side of Tenya ($_tenya) s critter-filled sack when it swung within his line of sight ; whether it was a stray leaf that fell from above and swirled once , twice before touching the stone . Shouto ($_shouto) found himself taken by a nothingness that fell just short of boredom . 
"
11790183,9,18,"He raised his head slightly and saw Ochako and Izuku ($_izuku) speaking amongst themselves . They walked close , Izuku on her ($_izuku) right , and Shouto ($_shouto) thought that if they moved a hair s width closer , their legs might tangle together . 
"
11790183,9,19,"Ochako ($_ochako) leaned toward him , and Shouto ($_shouto) could see Izuku ($_izuku) s lips moving . He ($_ochako) could not read them well enough , but he ($_ochako) managed to catch a few stray words . ... couldn t find moved yousei help 
"
11790183,9,20,"A brief silence before Ochako ($_ochako) began to speak . She ($_ochako) shook , then hung her ($_ochako) head . It s go to see teahouse talk . 
"
11790183,9,21,"He ($_ochako) saw Izuku ($_izuku) nod before taking her ($_ochako) hand to give a hard squeeze , then hold it for a moment before releasing it . Shouto couldn t be too sure what it meant . It could have been encouraging . Or reassuring. Either would fit , he supposed . Ochako ($_ochako) turned her ($_ochako) head to Izuku as her ($_ochako) foot caught another stair ; and she ($_ochako) gave him a smile small , tentative that made something stutter in Shouto ($_shouto) s chest . A something whose roots slipped from grasp , so he couldn t properly begin to understand its meaning or origin . But , it was there . A yearning . A something . 
"
11790183,9,22,"His reverie was broken when Inko ($_inko) said something to his far right . Her ($_inko) feet made no sound as she ($_inko) ascended the steps . Though , Shouto could not be sure she ($_inko) had legs at all , really . Or feet . At one glance she ($_inko) appeared normal , but then he would blink and her ($_inko) feet were no more , just a faded imitation of what he knew should be there , a mirage not easily dispelled . 
"
11790183,9,23,"Tenya , she ($_inko) started , how long will you be gone to see your boy ? 
"
11790183,9,24,"Tenya ($_tenya) s foot hesitated before he ($_tenya) fell into step with them once more . I can t be too sure , at the moment . He ($_tenya) s gone far too often , so I ll stay with him ($_tenya) for as long as I can . 
"
11790183,9,25,"Why does he ($_tenya) travel so much ? 
"
11790183,9,26,"For his ($_tenya) work , mostly , but whenever I learn of his ($_tenya) impending breaks , I come by to visit him ($_tenya) . 
"
11790183,9,27,"Old enough to work already ? 
"
11790183,9,28,"He ($_tenya) , er , that is his ($_tenya) guardian s work takes him ($_tenya) all over , and he ($_tenya) sometimes takes him ($_tenya) along . 
"
11790183,9,29,"Well , whenever you get some free time you should come back to visit us in the forest . You still remember the way , don t you ? Tenya ($_tenya) nodded his ($_tenya) confirmation , and Inko ($_inko) said , Good , then you should come by to visit sometime . 
"
11790183,9,30,"I wouldn t want to intrude o 
"
11790183,9,31,"He ($_tenya) was interrupted by Inko s laughter . Then , she smiled : this tiny thing that barely parted her lips but caught the warmth in her eyes . It wouldn t be intrusion ; it s an invitation . We liked having you around before , and Shouto ($_shouto) saw her bend slightly at the waist to look at him ($_shouto) the same goes for you too , Shouto ($_shouto) . When all this is over , you should keep coming over . 
"
11790183,9,32,"It would have been a fitting moment to simply nod , but when his eyes rose , he caught sight of an end . They had nearly reached the end of the staircase , and Shouto ($_shouto) s legs , noodles by this point , were screaming in thanks . 
"
11790183,9,33,"On either end of the stairs , sitting on elevated stone platforms were two komainu , an a-un pair . Their manes , while unruly , held an otherworldly elegance . The fur of their tails coiled toward their ends and seemed to dissipate into the air , only to reform in the blink of an eye through smooth undulations . They were all blurred edges and hazy borders ; overbearing presences that emanated power with broad chests and pronounced canines . 
"
11790183,9,34,"The un-gyou sat on its haunches as they approached , its mouth set in a straight line . Its eyes narrowed , and Shouto ($_shouto) realized it was not looking at him ($_shouto) , but Tenya ($_tenya) . The un-gyou shifted forward to transfer its weight before moving into a crouching position . 
"
11790183,9,35,"To Tenya ($_tenya) s credit , he ($_tenya) didn t so much as flinch under its scrutiny , but when Ochako ($_ochako) made her ($_ochako) way past the a-gyou . Its jaws were open wide to showcase its sharp teeth . Its eyes followed her ($_ochako) , then its head as it craned its body to watch her ($_ochako) move past . The a-gyou s mane followed ; it shifted to the side in one fluid motion before rolling into clumps of nothing that tapered off , like billows of smoke . Izuku ($_izuku) kept a hand on her ($_izuku) arm to keep her ($_izuku) limbs steady , but then it growled . Shouto ($_shouto) felt it more than he ($_shouto) heard it : a deep , guttural thing that was more reminiscent of a thundershower than anything else . It rumbled through his ($_shouto) chest , ricocheted off his ($_shouto) bones , and fixed itself at the base of his ($_shouto) throat . Still , Ochako ($_ochako) did not completely break under its gaze . She ($_izuku) only held her ($_izuku) white butterflies closer to her ($_izuku) chest , her ($_izuku) knuckles pale from the exertion . 
"
11790183,9,36,"When the last of them breached the topmost step , they saw before them a garden . The grass under Shouto ($_shouto) s shoes cushioned his ($_shouto) weight , a welcome relief . Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_shouto) unwilling to shuffle his ($_shouto) feet along , but the trees found in his ($_shouto) stillness an invitation . The willows stood sentry , watchful as ever . Their leaves flowed down in loose tendrils , a riot of green , and for every twitch of his ($_shouto) fingers , every turn of his ($_shouto) eyes , they moved as though provoked into action . There was no wind , no others trampling barely-bloomed flowers underfoot . There was no reason for their rhythmic dances , yet they carried on . 
"
11790183,9,37,"Inko_,_much_like_himself ($_himself) himself ($_shouto) , stood in place , but her ($_himself) eyes were transfixed on a dirt road which veered off into the unkown . Beyond her ($_himself) , Shouto ($_shouto) saw a flickering light beneath the hanging willows . It moved like a well-fed fire , and appeared to him ($_shouto) through soft curves and dim lines ; remote , yet close . Its ends licked at the nearby leaves , but did not catch or consume or char . Shouto ($_shouto) blinked . It was gone . Though when he averted his eyes and looked back , it had returned . 
"
11790183,9,38,"He heard Inko ($_inko) say , `` Do you ($_inko) see that too ? '' Her ($_inko) eyes never strayed to Shouto 's face , but he nodded regardless . 
"
11790183,9,39,"Inko ($_inko) inched forward , but Izuku ($_izuku) s hand caught her ($_izuku) arm . He didn t say anything , nor did he make a move to bring her ($_hisashi) back . It s fine , she ($_hisashi) said . I want to see Hisashi ($_hisashi) . I 've been waiting for a sign for so long . 
"
11790183,9,40,"Izuku ($_izuku) swallowed hard enough for Shouto ($_shouto) to distinguish the action . I mean , if you think it ll be good but do you really think he licked his lips as he took a step to her ($_hisashi) that he ll be there ? 
"
11790183,9,41,"I don t know . Her ($_hisashi) voice was quiet , unsure , yet her ($_hisashi) eyes would not sway . 
"
11790183,9,42,"I don t think it s a very good idea . 
"
11790183,9,43,"And Inko , her ($_hisashi) face a mosaic of melancholy , said , I know you don t , but I ve mentioned it for a while , haven t I ? 
"
11790183,9,44,"Izuku ($_izuku) nodded . 
"
11790183,9,45,"And if I don t go now that I ve seen a sign , I ll always regret it . Even if I can t find Hisashi ($_hisashi) , I ll always have answers , but I d at least like to know that I tried . Izuku ($_izuku) said nothing , but Shouto ($_shouto) saw his ($_shouto) grip on her ($_shouto) arm loosen , then tighten . What are you afraid of ? she ($_shouto) asked . 
"
11790183,9,46,"There was a tremor in his ($_shouto) voice , something nearly lost in its sound but reflected more wholly in his ($_shouto) words , when he ($_shouto) murmured , What if you don t come back ? 
"
11790183,9,47,"I leave sometimes , don t I ? He ($_shouto) nodded . But I always come back . This time ll be no different . I promise . I ll leave and come back , and if I don t find him ($_shouto) , then I ll at least know now . 
"
11790183,9,48,"But if you do if it actually works and you find him ($_shouto) what would he ($_shouto) do ? 
"
11790183,9,49,"He ($_shouto) wouldn t hurt me . 
"
11790183,9,50,"I don t know that , and I don t trust him ($_shouto) . 
"
11790183,9,51,"You don t have to trust him ($_shouto) . You know me , so trust me when I say I ll be fine . 
"
11790183,9,52,"Shouto ($_shouto) moved from where they spoke , but remained close enough to make out their words . He ($_shouto) leaned against a fountain constructed of a large bowl . It was possibly fading , with its initial color potentially being in the realm of a green or blue . 
"
11790183,9,53,"On the bowl s mouth was the statue of a ryuu coiling around itself so comfortably Shouto ($_shouto) had no doubt it was intentionally carved into the structure . Its mouth was open . Some water slipped past its jowls to fall into the fountain , the drops so few and the pressure so feeble there was little cause for it to function at all . Unlike the rest of the fountain , the ryuu was not covered in algae or moss . Its scales were a brilliant green that looked so clean , so well-maintained Shouto ($_shouto) was sure he ($_shouto) could count them all and run his ($_shouto) hand along its surface . 
"
11790183,9,54,"Slowly, slowly, slowly. He ($_shouto) eased his ($_shouto) hand along , but there was a sound . 
"
11790183,9,55,"A bout of panic stayed Shouto ($_shouto) s hand , for in his ($_shouto) haste he ($_shouto) failed to notice the rise and fall of its flank , the tremor in its jowls , or the strained grip of its taloned feet where it was rooted to the fountain . His ($_shouto) tongue was an anchor in his ($_shouto) mouth just a thick , dead weight which protested speech and his ($_shouto) legs , noodles where he ($_shouto) stood . There was a heat gathering in his ($_shouto) right side outside his ($_shouto) control . 
"
11790183,9,56,"He ($_shouto) felt something firm wrap around his ($_shouto) wrist and pull him ($_shouto) back . A hand ! Ochako and Tenya ($_tenya) were behind him ($_shouto) with Ochako ($_ochako) holding him ($_shouto) back . His ($_shouto) eyes , determined as ever , stared forward . 
"
11790183,9,57,"The ryuu drew back . Its mouth was pulled into a snarl ; its teeth , while large , resembled those of a dog . Dense brows furrowed over its eyes . 
"
11790183,9,58,"Human? Shouto ($_shouto) heard it ask even though its mouth never moved . Shouto ($_shouto) , eyes wide , could only nod . It sneered , then closed its mouth . Not interested , it said . It was a blatant dismissal . 
"
11790183,9,59,"Another poked its head over the fountain s edge . Its eyes scanned over them , going left to right twice before settling onto Shouto ($_shouto) . Call off your fox . 
"
11790183,9,60,"It rolled its eyes when Shouto ($_shouto) felt himself ($_shouto) being pulled away . A hand was clamped on his ($_shouto) right shoulder , and he ($_shouto) discovered it belonged to Ochako . 
"
11790183,9,61,"Don t want any trouble today . The first ryuu spoke in a drawl with extended vowels and clipped consonants . But you it sucked in air through its nose , and Shouto ($_shouto) felt the resulting breeze tug on the roots of his ($_shouto) hair smell funny . 
"
11790183,9,62,"Shouto ($_shouto) heard a rustling , like shifting fabric , from just behind his ($_shouto) left ear , and he ($_shouto) was hoisted up with arms wrapped securely around him ($_shouto) . When he ($_shouto) turned his ($_shouto) head , he ($_shouto) saw Izuku who put a hand on Shouto ($_shouto) s shoulder . 
"
11790183,9,63,"Hey , Izuku ($_izuku) started , are you ($_izuku) okay ? 
"
11790183,9,64,"It was Tenya who spoke when Shouto ($_shouto) s mouth refused to work . Everything s under control . Are you ($_izuku) fine to leave ? he ($_shouto) asked . 
"
11790183,9,65,"I ($_izuku) um , yeah . We should be fine to go now . Shouto ($_shouto) saw Izuku ($_izuku) s hands clench then relax . 
"
11790183,9,66,"Ochako ($_ochako) s voice came from his ($_ochako) left . She ($_ochako) s not coming along too ? 
"
11790183,9,67,"No , she ($_ochako) well , she ($_ochako) has something , or I ($_izuku) guess someone , else to check on first , but she ($_ochako) said she ($_ochako) d come back later . 
"
11790183,9,68,"Tenya ($_tenya) removed his ($_tenya) arms from Shouto ($_shouto) , and when he ($_tenya) turned , he ($_tenya) saw Inko looking to her ($_ochako) feet . Her ($_ochako) eyes would flit between the capering mirage and the ground . From the corner of his ($_tenya) eye he ($_tenya) saw Izuku ($_izuku) bite his ($_tenya) lips and hold their clothes closer to his ($_tenya) body . 
"
11790183,9,69,"Ochako ($_ochako) grabbed Shouto ($_shouto) s hand , and Shouto ($_shouto) nearly flinched away at the contact . He ($_shouto) could not say she ($_ochako) was unwelcome , but he ($_shouto) was not expecting her ($_ochako) openness to extend to himself ($_shouto) as well . We should go before it gets dark , then . 
"
11790183,9,70,"She ($_ochako) pulled Shouto ($_shouto) along behind her ($_ochako) . He ($_shouto) tried to maintain some focus on his ($_shouto) footing , but it was all he ($_shouto) could do to stop himself ($_shouto) from stumbling over his ($_shouto) feet . 
"
11790183,9,71,"With a hand on the small of Izuku ($_izuku) s back , Tenya ($_tenya) helped Ochako in steering them away despite Izuku ($_izuku) s clear reluctance . When at last Izuku ($_izuku) turned his ($_izuku) head from Inko ($_inko) , the underlying tension in the air thinned . It did not vanish entirely , but enough to allow Izuku , Ochako ($_ochako) , and Tenya ($_tenya) to converse freely , like old friends . Ochako ($_ochako) s hand left his ($_ochako) wrist at one point , and Shouto ($_shouto) slowed his ($_ochako) steps to allow them to speak in front of him ($_ochako) among themselves . 
"
11790183,9,72,"They came to a willow . It was much too large , but Shouto ($_shouto) could find it in himself ($_shouto) to admire it for what it was . Ochako ($_ochako) used her ($_ochako) free hand to pull its leaves back , revealing a red bridge . They walked through one at a time despite there being enough room for them all to walk side-by-side if they so chose . Shouto ($_shouto) watched them all go , stayed in place for a few moments longer than was necessary . A new feeling was springing through him : racing up and down the length of his arms and legs , swimming in his lungs , and pooling in his stomach . There was no distinct need to turn back , but he could not be sure he possessed the desire to go forward . 
"
11790183,9,73,"A jolt went through him starting from his toes . There was something , or someone , with him at that moment . Hands , small and precise , were on him between his shoulder blades , and they applied only a bit of pressure enough to bring a blade of grass to bend and enough to stop a train in its tracks to push him on his way . 
"
11790183,9,74,"His first foot fell upon the bridge s wood as he stumbled , but he kept going . It was not his own doing ; his feet just kept pulling themselves along as though compelled by some unseen force , and Shouto ($_shouto) could hardly open his mouth to protest . 
"
11790183,9,75,"Resigned to his fate , he kept trudging on behind the others . The willow provided a canopy of shade that was not needed and casted everything in an overlay of green . Its leaves were bunched together so closely only a few streaks of pure sunlight were able to come through and fix themselves in place on the wooden bridge . Shouto ($_shouto) used this time to listen . He ($_shouto) heard only the constant thud , thud , thudding of his ($_shouto) own feet along with his ($_shouto) companions . There was no one else . No one to force movement into his ($_shouto) limbs . No one to push him ($_shouto) forward when his ($_shouto) mind was lost in doubt . 
"
11790183,9,76,"Moments came and went with little words from Shouto ($_shouto) s mouth until he ($_shouto) came across what might have been an end . He ($_shouto) saw a spot of blue that only grew larger as they approached . It was the sky , he ($_shouto) thought . He ($_shouto) was so sure of it ; nothing could ever be so clear , so unfiltered , so blue except the sky . 
"
11790183,9,77,"At long last he ($_shouto) had reached the end . The great willow s leaves swung from where Tenya ($_tenya) pushed them aside for himself ($_tenya) , and Shouto ($_shouto) made to do the same . He ($_tenya) lifted them away , just as the others had before him ($_tenya) , and came to face a stretch of sea beneath the clear sky , the red bridge continuing on over the water with no end in sight .

11790183,9,85,"Shouto ($_shouto) would be lying to himself ($_shouto) if he ($_shouto) said he ($_shouto) was not a bit excited to see the sea , but what he ($_shouto) saw chilled him ($_shouto) . 
"
11790183,9,86,"There was nothing there , and in that void of nothingness there was only the knowledge that everything seemed to fade away , blend into a mass of space absent of any distinguishable traits . His ($_shouto) conscious mind was all that he ($_shouto) could find when he ($_shouto) lost focus , for everything was a constant buzz -LRB- his ($_shouto) hunger , for one thing ; the aching he ($_shouto) felt in his ($_shouto) soles , for another -RRB- that droned on . 
"
11790183,9,87,"They took four breaks since they began their journey across the sea . Some time ago , or not time in this new world never failed to elude him ($_shouto) they ended their fifth with Ochako ($_ochako) making conversation with Tenya ($_tenya) and Izuku ($_izuku) nodding along amicably . Izuku ($_izuku) would , at times , rest a hand on the red of the bridge and left it to trail after him ($_izuku) . 
"
11790183,9,88,"His ($_izuku) feet kept shuffling him ($_izuku) on . 
"
11790183,9,89,"It was equally as alien as it was familiar . From beneath his ($_izuku) feet , the wood of the bridge gave prolonged groans with such fervor Shouto ($_shouto) wondered if it was of the living . Time was escaping him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) could hardly decipher how long they d been walking ; one minute could have been an hour , could have been a day -LRB- though he ($_izuku) supposed the last was unlikely -RRB- . The sun never descended from the sky , but it had never relented in its radiance either . Was it morning ? Noon ? With his ($_izuku) hunger-addled mind , he ($_izuku) recounted the recent events he ($_izuku) knew to have taken place .

11790183,9,90,"Some time ago he ($_izuku) saw two ryuu flying in the opposite direction , heading the way Shouto came . They glided through the air with smooth , serpentine loops around themselves . There was another some time later that dipped in a wide arc in its flight before it came crashing down into the sea beside the bridge . The air around its body hissed with its speed , but if Shouto ($_shouto) had not seen it enter the water himself ($_shouto) , he ($_shouto) would hardly believe it happened at all . When he ($_shouto) followed its path , he ($_shouto) saw a wani , the largest one yet , cutting through the water . It swam out from under the bridge , its whiskers about as long as Shouto ($_shouto) was tall with an indiscernible length disappearing under the bridge . Where its head turned , its body followed in an even rhythm . The turtles and jellyfish moved about without worry ; there was not even so much as a falter in their movements . 
"
11790183,9,91,"Without addressing anyone in particular , Shouto ($_shouto) asked : Why are there so many here ? 
"
11790183,9,92,"It was Ochako ($_ochako) who answered him ($_shouto) . Her ($_shouto) feet never slowed her ($_shouto) , however , and where her ($_shouto) right hand gripped the handle of her ($_shouto) butterfly holder , her ($_shouto) fingers loosened then tightened themselves . Most of them are probably connected to the sea in some way , she ($_shouto) said . Actually , there re a lot where we re going too . Have you ever heard of Toyotama-hime ? 
"
11790183,9,93,"Shouto ($_shouto) hummed his ($_shouto) assent . 
"
11790183,9,94,"Well , she ($_shouto) vacationed at an inn around there once , so now it s a popular tourist attraction . 
"
11790183,9,95,"I remember hearing about that , Izuku ($_izuku) said . His ($_izuku) feet moved him ($_izuku) along more robotically than Shouto ($_shouto) had ever seen him ($_izuku) go , even before he ($_izuku) was given his ($_izuku) sandals . I heard there was a lot of commotion at Ryuuguu-jou when she ($_shouto) went missing . Everyone was complaining about getting stung by the jellyfish when they went into the water . 
"
11790183,9,96,"Shouto ($_shouto) turned his ($_shouto) head to look into the water below . There was not just one or two jellyfish speckled here and there , but a swarm . He ($_shouto) could make out their cone-like bodies , a dark pink , that billowed out with each pulsating jostle of their frilled tentacles . Below them there was a shape darkened by the water s depths . They passed another stone pillar , and Shouto ($_shouto) realized it was a turtled easing its way through . 
"
11790183,9,97,"It seems something similar is happening now , said Tenya ($_tenya) . It is not common that Ryuujin ($_ryuujin) sends so many of his ($_ryuujin) servants out at once . 
"
11790183,9,98,"He ($_ryuujin) focused his ($_ryuujin) mind on his ($_ryuujin) feet once more in the passing moments that followed . He ($_ryuujin) took a calm pace that made him ($_ryuujin) fall into step just behind the others , but Tenya ($_tenya) s feet carried him ($_ryuujin) along in short strides , each one bursting with a barely-concealed energy . The wood didn t grumble under his ($_ryuujin) weight . Rather , it stuttered in time with his ($_ryuujin) steps . 
"
11790183,9,99,"After another fit of comfortable silence , Shouto ($_shouto) saw over the arch of the bridge what appeared to be an end . He ($_shouto) was weary , of course , for the last time he ($_shouto) suspected they d reached their destination he ($_shouto) was led across a sea that sprawled out as far as his ($_shouto) eyes could see . His ($_shouto) doubts were only dispelled when Ochako ($_ochako) sped up . It was barely noticeable , but he ($_shouto) saw the slight tremor in her ($_ochako) free hand and the way the line of her ($_ochako) back straightened itself . 
"
11790183,9,100,"At the end of the bridge , there was a small structure with a gently curved roof , dark with red accents . In its center was a double door split evenly down the middle . It rested , presumably , on an island of land , though it was hard to tell . Its base was veiled in swirling masses of mist that hung heavy over the ground and hid the ongoing stretch of sea from view . The sight was only illuminated by the red glare of the paper lanterns that hung from the small house and the hitodama that lolled about . The sky had darkened significantly ; it was bright as noon only moments before . The sun had not completely faded from view , but it was lower in the sky . Evening was fast approaching . 
"
11790183,9,101,"As they made their way closer , they passed the last sets of pillars , one of which was the resting place of three more ryuu . They curled around each other in a tangle of limbs and heads , talons gripping the mortared stone with a tension that brought their long tails to wrap around the pillar s shape . 
"
11790183,9,102,"He saw them . They saw him . Their jaws hung open in fearsome snarls , but Shouto ($_shouto) found that in his ($_shouto) surprise , he ($_shouto) forgot to be frightened . He ($_shouto) could find the feeling swelling somewhere in the pit of his ($_shouto) stomach before it sank lower . Nearly dissipated altogether. His ($_shouto) surprise birthed curiosity , and it was this that allowed him ($_shouto) to meet their eyes one after another . He ($_shouto) strained his ($_shouto) eyes trying to decipher any threatening movement under the velvet of the sky . Their long whiskers flowed with an unseen force as their heads twisted to watch him ($_shouto) , sizing him ($_shouto) up . When it was clear there was no flicker of fear in him ($_shouto) , one s belly twitched before its nostrils flared to release a wisp of mist . 
"
11790183,9,103,"You may pass , it rumbled . Shouto ($_shouto) nodded in acknowledgement , as did Izuku , Ochako ($_ochako) , and Tenya ($_tenya) . 
"
11790183,9,104,"At long last , they reached the end of the red rimmed bridge . Shouto ($_shouto) , ever so thankful , stepped off the wood as quickly as his ($_shouto) body could manage . When his ($_shouto) first foot fell upon the island , he ($_shouto) felt plush grass beneath his ($_shouto) feet . Fog coiled around their legs like thick blankets , chilled and nearly tangible . There was something more there . A shimmer in the air . A ghostly caress , warm against his ($_shouto) skin . Felt, but not completely seen. Seen , but not completely felt ; just the remnants of feelings that fell just short of his ($_shouto) other senses . He ($_shouto) couldn t place his ($_shouto) finger on it , but something there was off . 
"
11790183,9,105,"They stepped onto the house s raised platform and walked past its low , orange-red fencing , garnished with gold ornaments on its highest points . Under its roof , the lanterns loomed overhead in a way that made looking directly at the dark double doors difficult . Everything was brighter than it should have been . Even the whispers of the grass were swallowed up in the stillness of the air . 
"
11790183,9,106,"The door was glossed over with the red light , but when he peered through the haze , he could see a golden knocker designed in the shape of a ryuu . Its borders were fashioned into curls that tapered off into even points at their ends , and it wore a brooding expression with its twin horns standing proud . Its eyes , shadowed by furrowed brows , bulged out and rolled into the back of its head before resurfacing when Izuku ($_izuku) grasped the ring it held between its teeth . 
"
11790183,9,107,"He banged the knocker on the door three times with a pause between each beat , equally spaced apart . 
"
11790183,9,108,"For a moment there was nothing . Just a fit of nothingness as its eyes rolled around . The shadows casted by the house s beams stretched out with a creeping slowness . Even their shadows shifted to dance where they puddled at their feet , now only vague shapes carved from their likeness . Clawing , slinking things that tore scars into the dark wood where their outlines raked through . 
"
11790183,9,109,"Izuku ($_izuku) s voice cut through Shouto ($_shouto) when he ($_izuku) spoke . Hey , Shouto ($_shouto) . When Shouto ($_shouto) s name slipped past his ($_shouto) lips , Shouto ($_shouto) was overcome with an invasive presence , something that prodded at him ($_shouto) beneath his ($_shouto) skin and sent shivers down his ($_shouto) spine . This ($_shouto) has never happened before , Shouto ($_shouto) thought as he ($_shouto) exhaled a steady breath from his ($_shouto) nose as though recovering from a blow . When the doors open close your eyes , he ($_shouto) warned , and don t let them open until you feel something under your feet . 
"
11790183,9,110,"Shouto ($_shouto) hardly had the time to process the information before the doors opened with a deep moan , rolling puffs of fog pouring past its ($_shouto) edges to pool at their feet . He ($_shouto) saw only black . Dark. Ominous. There was the sensation of phantom hands grasping at his ($_shouto) shoulders and an accompanying push from behind , before he ($_shouto) was pulled in with the others . 
"
11790183,9,111,"He ($_shouto) squeezed his ($_shouto) eyes shut as the ground was pulled from his ($_shouto) feet . Shouto ($_shouto) was drifting , buoyant in a void of darkness that he ($_shouto) knew was everywhere around him ($_shouto) . His ($_shouto) hearing was the first thing to go , then his ($_shouto) sense of smell . Before , he ($_shouto) never thought about the dark as its ($_shouto) own entity , but now he ($_shouto) could not help but ponder the thought as caution tugged at the lump in his ($_shouto) throat . At home the darkness was not a presence , did not occupy space . He ($_shouto) could no longer think that not as he ($_shouto) felt it envelop him ($_shouto) in a warm embrace and carry him ($_shouto) off to unknowns . 
"
11790183,9,112,"The first thing he ($_shouto) felt , really felt , was a warmth on his ($_shouto) skin that came to settle over his ($_shouto) cheeks . Then came the gust of dry wind that busied past , followed by the ringing of bells , various high-pitched cries that keened in his ($_shouto) ears . He ($_shouto) could hear again . He ($_shouto) could feel again . But he ($_shouto) still couldn t see , for his ($_shouto) eyes were still closed . Shouto ($_shouto) waited until there was something solid beneath his ($_shouto) feet . He ($_shouto) shifted himself ($_shouto) side to side , and it did not crack , did not give under his ($_shouto) weight . The ground . He ($_shouto) opened his ($_shouto) eyes as he ($_shouto) was instructed . 
"
11790183,9,113,"It was clearly day in this new place ; the beating sun of noon told him ($_shouto) as much . There was a set of stairs that swooped upwards to the sky just ahead , only twelve steps at the most and meagerly spaced apart at half a pace . They were bordered by various shops and vendors so close there was no need for any banister , as the stairs were connected to the line of shops themselves with accompanying strings of red lanterns , unlit , hanging from the underside of their roofs on either side . Shouto ($_shouto) turned his ($_shouto) head to see Ochako ($_ochako) and Izuku ($_izuku) dusting themselves down in front of a wall marked with trails of ivy that wound up to scale the bricks in delicate patterns . There was no door . No way back . 
"
11790183,9,114,"Where he expected Tenya ($_tenya) to be , there was only a heap of clothing in a pile . Navy ($_navy) blue and black modest looking fabrics with sandals kicked off to the side , one upright on its ($_navy) soles and the other turned over , nowhere near each other as though thrown . A black fox was peering up at Shouto ($_shouto) , its ($_navy) fur glossy and thick . It ($_navy) was Tenya , though it ($_navy) took Shouto ($_shouto) a moment to recall . 
"
11790183,9,115,"Tenya ($_tenya) s whiskers bristled forward , and he yipped , stomped a paw against the ground before he ducked his head down to sniff at his rodent-filled sack . He picked it up and walked past a cooing Ochako ($_ochako) to the foot of the stairs . 
"
11790183,9,116,"I forgot , Ochako ($_ochako) said through a giggle , how cute you are . 
"
11790183,9,117,"Tenya ($_tenya) s ears flicked forward twice , then back once . I hardly think that s accurate . His tail curled around his legs as he sat , embarrassed . 
"
11790183,9,118,"Izuku ($_izuku) said , Let s keep going . He ($_izuku) took to the stairs at a sedate pace , and Shouto and Ochako ($_ochako) followed . 
"
11790183,9,119,"Tenya ($_tenya) surged up . He ($_tenya) stopped himself ($_tenya) after every four steps or so , if only to be sure they were still moving as he ($_tenya) bound on ahead . 
"
11790183,9,120,"There s an inn with an onsen somewhere around here we can stay at , Izuku ($_izuku) told him ($_tenya) . As they ascended Shouto ($_shouto) heard the tell-tale sign of a flourishing town : the buzz of voices that droned around them , nearly palpable as it gathered into a collective hum . I know the owner , so he ($_izuku) might let us stay if there s an empty room . 
"
11790183,9,121,"Ochako ($_ochako) nodded . He ($_izuku) s even busier this time of year , though . You d be lucky to even get a room . 
"
11790183,9,122,"When they reached the top , Shouto ($_shouto) saw that the line of shops and lanterns continued in both directions and across the way , various youkai flitting in and out of view in their strides , but to his far right he could make out a turbulent river . 
"
11790183,9,123,"He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Ochako ($_ochako) . It was nice traveling with you , she ($_ochako) said . I hope I ll get to see you again soon . Tenya ($_tenya) had lost his ($_tenya) clothes , but Ochako ($_ochako) somehow managed to keep her ($_ochako) butterflies intact . They were currently perched on the holder s mesh lining , their white wings beating in soft strokes all the while . 
"
11790183,9,124,"Izuku ($_izuku) told her ($_ochako) with his ($_izuku) regular grin , I hope you come to visit soon . 
"
11790183,9,125,"She ($_ochako) nodded as she ($_ochako) went to hug him ($_izuku) , then disappeared into the moving crowd . Only a few moved to allow her ($_ochako) some room to walk , and Ochako ($_ochako) thanked them while maintaining her ($_ochako) relaxed walk onwards . 
"
11790183,9,126,"Tenya ($_tenya) bat a paw against his ($_tenya) shin which he ($_tenya) then used as leverage to stand on his ($_tenya) hind legs . Do be sure to take care of yourself . Make sure you eat your meals often , and get at least seven hours of sleep a night . He ($_tenya) kept his ($_tenya) black tail parallel to the ground with the white orb balancing on its end . 
"
11790183,9,127,"Where do you have to go for your son ? Izuku ($_izuku) asked . He ($_izuku) stumbled over the last word for a moment , but somehow managed to speak it . 
"
11790183,9,128,"Tenya ($_tenya) maneuvered the upper half of his ($_tenya) body to press himself ($_tenya) into Shouto ($_shouto) s leg and away from Izuku ($_izuku) s inquisitive eyes . He ($_tenya) s not my son , but he ($_tenya) s mine . 
"
11790183,9,129,"Your boy ? 
"
11790183,9,130,"Yes. 
"
11790183,9,131,"But not your son . 
"
11790183,9,132,"Tenya ($_tenya) nodded as much as he ($_tenya) was able . 
"
11790183,9,133,"Izuku ($_izuku) shifted his ($_izuku) weight . Will he ($_izuku) be coming to meet you somewhere or where exactly will you be ? 
"
11790183,9,134,"Not far. I ll be somewhere in the area , I believe . If you manage to get a room at the inn , I ll come to visit soon . 
"
11790183,9,135,"He ($_izuku) brought himself ($_izuku) down to all-fours once again . He ($_izuku) shuffled his ($_izuku) feet in place . His ($_izuku) ears folded back to his ($_izuku) skull just enough to let Shouto ($_shouto) know he ($_izuku) was filling to the brim with an anxious energy that found refuge in his ($_izuku) fidgeting limbs . We won t keep you long , Shouto ($_shouto) said . It was he ($_izuku) racked his ($_izuku) brain searching for a suitable word nice meeting you . 
"
11790183,9,136,"Tenya ($_tenya) gave them both something like a bark before he ($_tenya) nodded and turned to sprint away down the street . Soft-footed , Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t hear him ($_tenya) as he ($_tenya) took off , a dark shadow streaking through the bustle of people . 
"
11790183,9,137,"He ($_tenya) s so fast , Shouto ($_shouto) said , amazement evident in his ($_tenya) tone . 
"
11790183,9,138,"Izuku ($_izuku) hummed his ($_izuku) agreement . He ($_izuku) s a descendent of Keizobo . It would be odd if he ($_izuku) wasn t. 
"
11790183,9,139,"He ($_izuku) took Shouto ($_shouto) s wrist in his ($_izuku) hand and guided him ($_izuku) through the masses . A cat adorned in jewels and prancing on its hindlegs with a kiseru pipe held between its paws . A plume of smoke which wafted up from a barbecue vendor and took the ill-defined shape of a human . A giant snake creeping its way down along a clothing shop and the responding rustle of the ivy leaves rooted to the bricks . This busy town to Shouto ($_shouto) to Shouto ($_shouto) strolling under arching bridges over shops , to Shouto admiring the strength of the winding river held a charm he had yet to see in this realm . The patches of green interspersed in its cobblestone paths whispered to him as kindly as the blades of grass in Izuku ($_izuku) s woods , and Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t help but feel some tinge of familiarity bloom in his chest . 
"
11790183,9,140,"Izuku ($_izuku) told Shouto ($_shouto) to keep his ($_izuku) head low , to walk with a purpose even if he ($_izuku) found he ($_izuku) didn t have one . They bobbed and weaved through the crowd and avoided any prolonged conversation . Shouto ($_shouto) refreshed his ($_shouto) eyes by glancing up , on occasion , and the sights certainly helped to stave on any oncoming boredom . Though , just as fast as his ($_shouto) head rose , Izuku ($_izuku) told him ($_shouto) to duck his ($_shouto) eyes -LRB- Some of them might not appreciate direct eye-contact here . Is it considered rude ? Well , sometimes but it s more nosy than anything . Things can feel different here . -RRB- . 
"
11790183,9,141,"They took off in a jog , Izuku ($_izuku) having released his ($_shouto) hold on Shouto ($_shouto) s wrist , and strayed close enough to brush their shoulders and arms together . Izuku ($_izuku) led him ($_shouto) down a curved path along the river teeming with fish that pushed on in a swift current . It lapped at the edges of their path -LRB- a warning , or even a threat to pull them in -RRB- but only made off with dirt . Down a narrow side street , under a cluster of unlit red lanterns , they went ; past a boy painting cats on an eroded brick wall that peeled off and sprang away from where they were once bound ; through an arched doorway lined by walls of flowers who sang as they went past . This , just being with Izuku ($_izuku) in such a way , brought Shouto ($_shouto) a sense of calm as though they had never left his forest . 
"
11790183,9,142,"won t fucking fit ! 
"
11790183,9,143,"Izuku ($_izuku) stopped , then tilted his ($_izuku) head up at the sound of the new voice . It boomed over the roar of the thrashing river and stopped Shouto ($_shouto) in his ($_shouto) tracks . 
"
11790183,9,144,"He ($_shouto) followed Izuku ($_izuku) s line of sight to above them and over the river , on a red bridge that led to the entrance of a large building . There was a boy , or someone with an appearance close to his age , with light hair and red eyes , his mouth set in a sneer . Shouto ($_shouto) could see the hilt of a sword peeking out on his ($_shouto) other side . 
"
11790183,9,145,"Across from him ($_shouto) was a giant skeleton , its jaw rattling as it shook its head . There wasn t a scrap of muscle on its bones as it moved toward the man in its crouching position . Its jaw rose and fell with its teeth clattering together .

"
11790183,9,149,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked to Izuku and found him ($_shouto) grinning ; whether in amusement or recognition , Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t be sure . Well , we found the inn

"
11790183,9,154,"Let s go , Izuku ($_izuku) told him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) ascended up a small set of stairs to their left , Shouto in tow , to the red bridge .

11790183,9,155,"After a string of clatters , the_boy ($_shouto) shouted : Well , I ($_shouto) don t give a damn who told you it was fine to just show up ! I m telling you The moment Izuku s hand gripped the bridge s red railing , the_boy ($_shouto) turned with his ($_shouto) blonde hair flowing as though disturbed by an onslaught of wind . Deku ? he ($_shouto) questioned in his ($_shouto) gruff voice .

11790183,9,156,"Shouto ($_shouto) gave a hard blink in response . He ($_shouto) hadn t heard that name in so long he ($_shouto) d almost forgotten it was one of Izuku ($_izuku) s monikers .

His ($_shouto) eyes only settled on Shouto for a moment before he ($_shouto) turned back to the gashadokuro . There was little warning before a great toad leapt onto the bridge . With leathery , rough skin , it sat still as its bulging eyes flitted from person to person . On its back was a woman wielding a sword with the severed head of an aged man floating beside her . 
"
11790183,9,159,"His ($_shouto) red eyes narrowed as he ($_shouto) regarded the new-comers . I should ve known it was you two , he ($_shouto) spat out .

"
11790183,9,162,"The woman descended from atop the toad to follow him ($_shouto) . The floating head went after them both , hair matted at the roots and eyes bloodshot and wild . The toad hopped off the bridge while the gashadokuro stayed in place ; though , it did rise slightly from its position where it was hunched over .

11790183,9,163,"When the party made to pass them , Izuku ($_izuku) pivoted on his ($_izuku) right foot to follow along after them , but the_boy ($_shouto) stopped him ($_izuku) with a single word : Stop .

The last photo featured more space than person , for the subject was suspended in the air , sitting on a white cloud . Another young man , his neatly combed hair was a shade of blonde that seemed closer to a pale yellow than Katsuki ($_katsuki) s ashen shade . His mouth was set in a smug smirk , and something slender curved out from behind his back , a brown tail . The ink below the picture was smeared .
