"
14763564,13,2,"The_sleepy_prince_was_awoken_by_soft ($_izuku) cries of his ($_izuku) own name . A familiar voice tickled in his ($_izuku) ears , it 's weight leaning into his ($_izuku) cheek , it 's warmth welcoming . 
"
14763564,13,3,"The world cleared of fog , eyes opening to find Izuku ($_izuku) with his ($_izuku) arms outstretched and enclosed around his ($_izuku) cheek in a hard hug . He ($_izuku) was extremely close , his ($_izuku) eyes almost looking life sized ; wide and green and so teary they shined like emeralds . 
"
14763564,13,4,"He ($_izuku) frowned and tried to pull some distance between them . The fairy was still crying . Still hugging just as hard. Like he ($_izuku) was scared to let go . # . "" ...'zuku. . ?"" 
"
14763564,13,5,"He ($_izuku) could hear the sleep and pain in his ($_izuku) own dry voice . 
"
14763564,13,6,"Whether Izuku ($_izuku) heard it or not was a mystery as the fairy started to explain in a sudden huff . 
"
14763564,13,7,"`` I-I went to sleep on a tree nearby ... I thought that 'cause I could see the water it would be fine ... but when I woke up it was bright and - y-you were both gone . I thought I would find you at first if I went around the town b-but after an hour or so I realised I was lost . I was so afraid that something had happened to you , I started to fly back to the tower but then I saw Kacchan ($_kacchan) - '' 
"
14763564,13,8,"`` Izuku you approached him ($_kacchan) !? '' 
"
14763564,13,9,"He ($_kacchan) could see the guilt and shame within the expression of Izuku ($_izuku) - he ($_kacchan) had always been an expressive creature with wide and dramatic gestures , so his ($_kacchan) emotions could never truly be hidden . 
"
14763564,13,10,"He ($_kacchan) nodded and sighed , his ($_kacchan) eyes welled up with tears again . 
"
14763564,13,11,"`` He ($_kacchan) - He ($_kacchan) called you a - '' 
"
14763564,13,12,"`` That 's fine . '' Shouto ($_shouto) insisted , knowing that the ending of that sentence could injure him ($_shouto) with words alone . `` But we do n't talk about - him ($_shouto) - anymore . And let 's not call him ($_shouto) Kacchan ($_kacchan) . '' 
"
14763564,13,13,"Izuku ($_izuku) bit his ($_izuku) lip and shook where he ($_izuku) stood . `` I. . . I should n't have left you with him ($_izuku) . '' His ($_izuku) voice was low in the dark room they shared . The curtains up and the childish white of it all now a sad grey . 
"
14763564,13,14,"`` I-I heard him ($_shouto) that night in the forest talking about ... hurting you ($_shouto) . I thought it was a dream . I 'm so , so sorry . '' 
"
14763564,13,15,"Tiny fingers , the only fingers in the word Shouto ($_shouto) had known not to hurt him ($_shouto) , clenched around his ($_shouto) cheek for support . 
"
14763564,13,16,"Shouto ($_shouto) closed his ($_shouto) eyes and leaned his ($_shouto) head into the fairy in acceptance . 
"
14763564,13,17,"""Whatever! Forget him ($_shouto) ! I 'm just glad you 're safe . I went all the way back to the tower you know . I searched the entire place and thought I 'd never see you again . Then I saw and followed your father ... when I found you , you looking like this , I thought my heart would fall out of it 's place . Oh Shouto , you were so silent in your sleep , I had to check you were breathing but you just would n't wake up ! I was so afraid , afraid that you 'd be like this forever and your eyes would never open again.I-I 'm so happy you 're awake . I 've never been so afraid in my life ! '' 
"
14763564,13,18,"Shouto ($_shouto) paled - a look of confusion washing over him ($_shouto) . 
"
14763564,13,19,"`` You went all the way back to the tower ? '' 
"
14763564,13,20,"`` That 's right . '' He ($_shouto) nodded , wiping his ($_shouto) tears from his ($_shouto) eyes . `` I-I may have been gone for two or three days , it was hard to keep a track . When I ($_i) got here you slept for the entire fourth day I ($_i) think . '' 
"
14763564,13,21,"`` B-But . ."" 
"
14763564,13,22,"`` It 's okay Shouto , you deserve your rest . '' He ($_shouto) looked at his ($_shouto) human full of love and care . `` Now ... '' The fairy hitched in a breath so large his ($_shouto) chest visually expanded . `` Now you have to focus that energy on escaping . '' 
"
14763564,13,23,"The word escape hit Shouto ($_shouto) so hard he ($_shouto) pulled back to lean on his ($_shouto) good arm and shook his ($_shouto) head . 
"
14763564,13,24,"`` No . Not after what happened last time . '' He ($_shouto) spoke firmly . 
"
14763564,13,25,"`` Now it will be different , '' The green fairy pleaded . `` You know the outside world is n't nearly what you think , you do n't need a guide ! '' 
"
14763564,13,26,"`` Izuku ... I ca n't . '' 
"
14763564,13,27,"`` Just look at you Shouto ($_shouto) ! '' He ($_shouto) yelled quietly , `` It hurts me so much to see you like this ... you think it will stop ? You think he ($_shouto) 'll just wake up one day and decide that he ($_shouto) does n't want to hurt you ! Of course not Shouto ($_shouto) that 's just ... if you ... if you ever want to escape this pain the first thing you have to do it help your self . '' 
"
14763564,13,28,"The_Prince ($_the) felt terrible , because the fairy had been crying all night and now that he ($_the) 'd woken up the fairy had started to cry again . He ($_the) opened his ($_the) mouth to say no , but no words came out . 
"
14763564,13,29,"Finally , with all the strength he ($_the) had left and his ($_the) mismatched eyes half shut , the_boy ($_the) uttered . ""Exactly. Look at me . I 'm a broken mess . I ca n't even get out of this bed , let alone this he - '' 
"
14763564,13,30,"A knock on the door startled the both of them , Izuku ($_izuku) bolting up on his ($_izuku) wings . 
"
14763564,13,31,"A second before he ($_izuku) could leave , Shouto ($_shouto) grabbed him ($_izuku) with his ($_izuku) good hand and sat up so the fairy was hidden from view behind his ($_izuku) back . 
"
14763564,13,32,"`` Prince Sho ? '' 
"
14763564,13,33,"It was a voice he ($_izuku) was uncertain of . Anxiety started to force its way through his ($_izuku) system again . But he ($_izuku) bit his ($_izuku) lip and said . 
"
14763564,13,34,"""Yes?"" 
"
14763564,13,35,"The door creaked open . 
"
14763564,13,36,"Only now did he ($_izuku) realise his ($_izuku) vulnerability . Cold air came in with a tall man , somewhat familiar with a shaggy , nonchalant appearance and messy black hair . 
"
14763564,13,37,"Shouto ($_shouto) bristled as he ($_shouto) came closer , and the_man_'s ($_izuku) disturbingly perceptive eyes seeming to pick up on this fact so he ($_shouto) halted . 
"
14763564,13,38,"He ($_shouto) was resting not too far away , but not too close either . 
"
14763564,13,39,"The_Prince_'s ($_the) bruised throat went dry . His ($_shouto) uninjured hand pinching at the limp skin of the other arm as he ($_shouto) waited like a pup . He ($_shouto) felt like he ($_shouto) should say something , but could n't think of what . 
"
14763564,13,40,"His ($_shouto) eyes remained averted , cautious . 
"
14763564,13,41,"`` I ($_shouto) thought I ($_shouto) should bring you ($_shouto) some new clothes . '' 
"
14763564,13,42,"Nodding sceptically , he ($_shouto) reached out a single hand to retrieve the neatly folded pile . But the_man ($_izuku) stopped mid way and sighed . 
"
14763564,13,43,"`` At least , that was before I saw the state you ($_shouto) 're in . '' 
"
14763564,13,44,"He ($_shouto) would have been offended , but he ($_shouto) knew it was probably true . He ($_shouto) glanced down , finding that the fur blanket had slipped down to his ($_shouto) lower waist . His ($_shouto) skin was bruised - finger print sized , but most commonly mouth sized in a way that had his ($_shouto) stomach churning and head aching like he ($_shouto) was displaying things he ($_shouto) was n't supposed to . 
"
14763564,13,45,"He ($_shouto) clutched the blanket around himself ($_shouto) and tried to focus elsewhere . He ($_shouto) could feel the other 's eyes on him ($_shouto) , and from his ($_shouto) experience , that could mean only one thing . 
"
14763564,13,46,"`` Now , I ($_shouto) think I ($_shouto) 'd better give these to you ($_shouto) after you ($_shouto) have a wash . And a trip to the infirmary would be in your ($_shouto) best interests too . '' 
"
14763564,13,47,"Shouto ($_shouto) felt a lump forming in his ($_shouto) throat for some reason . He ($_shouto) did n't know this_man ($_izuku) , and found him ($_shouto) very difficult to read . Why would he ($_shouto) want Shouto in the infirmary or bath ... places like that would surely offer many opportunities for the sort of acts he ($_shouto) hated . 
"
14763564,13,48,"`` I ($_shouto) suppose you 'll be coming with me ($_shouto) ? '' 
"
14763564,13,49,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) could tell from the first few minutes with the_Prince ($_the) that the_boy ($_the) was strange . Something was off about him ($_the) . For one , he ($_the) seemed almost completely lacking in confidence . Like the air itself was a threat . He ($_the) looked in pain every time he ($_the) spoke , which was no wonder with the shocking condition of his ($_the) torso , and eyes anxious to be left alone again . 
"
14763564,13,50,"`` If you want me to . I can always send you with someone you 're more comfortable with . '' 
"
14763564,13,51,"""Like who?"" 
"
14763564,13,52,"`` The Ki - '' 
"
14763564,13,53,"`` No . '' 
"
14763564,13,54,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) acted shocked to hear that , but on the inside , the_man ($_izuku) was growing more and more aware of the_young_man_'s ($_izuku) distaste for his ($_izuku) own father . 
"
14763564,13,55,"`` Then a servant . Someone closer to your own age . '' 
"
14763564,13,56,"`` I ($_izuku) do n't want to go at all . '' 
"
14763564,13,57,"It was almost petulant the way he ($_izuku) whispered it . Like it was a secret , or he ($_izuku) was afraid saying it too loudly would cause the very earth itself to split open . 
"
14763564,13,58,"Honestly , it raised more questions than answers . Instead of fearing for the condition of his ($_izuku) body , why was the kid ignoring the bruises ? Like he ($_izuku) was content to sit there filthy and bruised . 
"
14763564,13,59,"`` As a royal Adviser , I 'm not giving you a choice . The longer those wounds are left , the more likely they are to develop into something more dangerous . And unless you move , you 'll be covered in bed sores too . '' 
"
14763564,13,60,"He ($_izuku) could see different coloured brows frowning with intense concentration into the bed , as if remembering other times of injury . As if contemplating his ($_izuku) chances of survival . As if considering his ($_izuku) position in the castle and what hope he ($_izuku) had of denying . 
"
14763564,13,61,"He ($_izuku) simply waited for the child to respond . 
"
14763564,13,62,"`` I-I do n't mind if it 's you who takes me . '' 
"
14763564,13,63,"So he ($_izuku) helped the teen into a robe and watched as he ($_izuku) used one hand to limp out of the cot . He ($_izuku) did n't miss the ball of green light slipping into the navy pockets of the clothing , but chose to ignore it in favour of opening the door and leading the 18 year old prince through his ($_izuku) home for the very first time in his ($_izuku) life . 
"
14763564,13,64,"The_boy ($_the) walked behind . 
"
14763564,13,65,"When told that he ($_izuku) could walk beside or before the Adviser if he ($_izuku) wanted to , he ($_izuku) was met with a glare . Even as servants or others passed them , the teen would keep his head firmly to the ground refusing to acknowledge them and their curious , questioning glances between bows . 
"
14763564,13,66,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) was let them all see the_Prince ($_the) . 
"
14763564,13,67,"He 'd been ` dead ' for so long now , word would take it 's time to slip out , but the more people that knew of the_boy_'s ($_the) existence , the more security he 'd have against the real threat of being hidden away again . 
"
14763564,13,68,"He made sure to avoid the Kings path of course , having memorised his daily plan down to which window 's he 'd be looking out of . 
"
14763564,13,69,"They entered the infirmary first and Shouto ($_shouto) skidded to a halt . `` I want to wash before - '' 
"
14763564,13,70,"`` That could make things worse . '' 
"
14763564,13,71,"He opened the door , but found the_Prince_'s ($_the) hand slam over his , almost burning hot and holding tightly as he shook his head , insisting way more firmly than he had thought the_boy ($_the) capable of . 
"
14763564,13,72,"`` We 're going to the baths first . '' 
"
14763564,13,73,"`` Prince_Sho ($_sho) , how do you ($_sho) plan to wash with one hand ? '' 
"
14763564,13,74,"`` Without your ($_sho) help for sure . '' He glared . `` I ($_sho) 'll manage . '' 
"
14763564,13,75,"He tried to turn around and head away , but Aizawa ($_aizawa) calmly walked in front of him and lowered his voice . His face was near - blue and black eyes blinked at the sight into a wide , frightened look that had the Prince backing up into the door as far as he could , lip trembling . 
"
14763564,13,76,"Thankfully , Aizawa ($_aizawa) kept his ($_aizawa) voice slow and closed his ($_aizawa) eyes , leaning back the second he ($_aizawa) noticed his ($_aizawa) mistake . 
"
14763564,13,77,"`` I did n't mean to startle you . '' 
"
14763564,13,78,"He ($_aizawa) was met with an almost silent but long exhale . 
"
14763564,13,79,"The_boy ($_the) was strange alright . That look was so powerful he ($_aizawa) almost felt as if he ($_aizawa) really had done something horrible just by stepping near to him ($_aizawa) . 
"
14763564,13,80,"`` But whatever it is you 're trying to hide , think about who it is you 're really harming and who you think you 're protecting . Do you think they deserve it ? '' 
"
14763564,13,81,"Shouto ($_shouto) was glaring daggers now . This_man ($_aizawa) knew . This_man ($_aizawa) knew and it ($_aizawa) felt like the cover of his ($_aizawa) most precious book had been ripped open , its ($_aizawa) tattered pages revealed to the harshly critical world . 
"
14763564,13,82,"He ($_aizawa) swallowed but his ($_aizawa) throat was dry , hand fumbling in his ($_aizawa) pocket to try and hold Izuku . He ($_aizawa) wished the fairy could comfort him ($_aizawa) now . 
"
14763564,13,83,"His ($_aizawa) silence had Aizawa ($_aizawa) meeting his ($_aizawa) gaze again and softening . `` We just want to keep our prince safe . '' 
"
14763564,13,84,"So far everyone had said that . Shouto ($_shouto) no longer knew what the word safe meant . 
"
14763564,13,85,"He ($_aizawa) allowed himself ($_aizawa) to be lead into the room , and watched from the corner of his ($_aizawa) eye as the door clicked shut behind him ($_aizawa) . 
"
14763564,13,86,"He ($_aizawa) felt defeated . Helpless to this . 
"
14763564,13,87,"There was an old woman before him ($_aizawa) , at a desk with a book before her . Naturally , he ($_aizawa) felt curiosity as to what she was reading , but kept himself ($_aizawa) firmly still where he ($_aizawa) stood as she eventually turned around with a smile too big for her own face . 
"
14763564,13,88,"Shouto ($_shouto) blinked . 
"
14763564,13,89,"`` Who do we have here ? '' 
"
14763564,13,90,"This was the second woman he ($_aizawa) 'd spoken too . This one a stark contrast to the first . She was neither strong nor beautiful , and her hair was withered and almost colourless compared to the solid black of the first . 
"
14763564,13,91,"Yet , there was still a soft of grace and femininity to her movements that had his head tilting to studying her . She was also perhaps the oldest person he had ever met , with worn skin he 'd never seen before , finding his imagination of such appearances from book descriptions to be a little off from the real thing . 
"
14763564,13,92,"`` Prince Sho . '' Aizawa ($_aizawa) answered for him , from the side of the room where he leaned against the door . 
"
14763564,13,93,"`` Oh haha Is that so ? '' 
"
14763564,13,94,"The doctor took the words as a joke , laughing heartily to herself as she grabbed several objects Shouto ($_shouto) was equally intrigued by and wiped her spectacles on her coat . `` And I suppose the_King ($_the) has kept him ($_the) locked away in his ($_the) room this whole time , huh ? '' 
"
14763564,13,95,"She amused herself , finally placing on her glasses and walking forwards . 
"
14763564,13,96,"`` No . A tower . '' 
"
14763564,13,97,"The second her eyes caught sight of the teen , her smile vanished . It was replaced by a frown , burdened with concern and worry but masked with professionalism as she briefly glanced back to Aizawa in a form of silent communication . 
"
14763564,13,98,"Shouto ($_shouto) wondered if he ($_shouto) 'd said something wrong . 
"
14763564,13,99,"He ($_shouto) was sure his ($_shouto) injuries were n't anything out of the normal bruises - aside from maybe his ($_shouto) aching arm . But both Aizawa ($_aizawa) and the Doctor were so serious it made him ($_shouto) nervous . 
"
14763564,13,100,"That word swelled into his ($_shouto) mind again . Abuse . Abuse Victim . They thought he ($_shouto) was so weak but he ($_shouto) was n't , this was nothing . They were the ones making a huge deal of it . 
"
14763564,13,101,"`` His ($_shouto) left arm is definitely dislocated . Potential injury to the ribs or spine ... swelling in the face and worse on the neck . Young man did you walk all the way here ? '' 
"
14763564,13,102,"He ($_shouto) nodded , interested in the way she poked at various parts of him ($_shouto) gently . 
"
14763564,13,103,"`` Are you not in any kind of pain ? '' She asked , frowning . 
"
14763564,13,104,"He ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head . `` The arm hurts . Everything else is fine . '' 
"
14763564,13,105,"`` And you 're on no spells ? No medication or herbs ? '' 
"
14763564,13,106,"He ($_shouto) frowned , considering his ($_shouto) father giving him ($_shouto) something in his ($_shouto) sleep but then , realising the_man ($_shouto) was incapable of helping , settled with a silent shake of his ($_shouto) head . 
"
14763564,13,107,"She gave the man behind him ($_shouto) another of her strange , knowing looks before asking . `` Would you mind taking off the robe ? '' 
"
14763564,13,108,"Instead of asking the questions they would usually expect , or pausing to think things through , Shouto ($_shouto) simply dropped the robe off his ($_shouto) shoulders to the floor without hesitation . As if he ($_shouto) 'd been expecting it . 
"
14763564,13,109,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) was rarely ever shocked , but his ($_aizawa) mouth fell quickly , and Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) rushed to pull the curtains shut around them . 
"
14763564,13,110,"As the blue material blocked his ($_aizawa) view of the kid , his ($_aizawa) eyes clenched shut immediately , barring away the anger and more than anything else , sickness that coursed through him ($_aizawa) . It made it hard to breathe , hard to think that he ($_aizawa) was near the man responsible for so long without even knowing . 
"
14763564,13,111,"Shouto ($_shouto) simply watched as the short woman stood before him ($_aizawa) and hastily started to dab ointments over his ($_aizawa) skin in multiple places . 
"
14763564,13,112,"His ($_aizawa) head followed her movements , eyes no longer afraid but stoic . She stopped lots of the bleeding that was yet to scab , covered over the places where teeth marks had pierced his ($_aizawa) skin and even wiping the dried blood and liquids from his ($_aizawa) thighs . 
"
14763564,13,113,"`` I ($_aizawa) 'm going to the bath after this , you do n't have to clean me ($_aizawa) . '' 
"
14763564,13,114,"His ($_aizawa) words were n't given an answer . Something was plaguing the woman that he ($_aizawa) could n't read from her face . Her lighthearted laughter and loose movements were gone , now tense and fast . 
"
14763564,13,115,"He ($_aizawa) tilted his ($_aizawa) head . 
"
14763564,13,116,"`` This arm is dislocated . '' 
"
14763564,13,117,"He ($_aizawa) nodded . `` I know . '' 
"
14763564,13,118,"`` You know ? Then why did n't you put it back into place . It would have prevented a lot of the swelling and bruising . '' 
"
14763564,13,119,"`` I passed out . When I woke up , I thought that he 'd only break it again . '' 
"
14763564,13,120,"She paused , stopping from her work on his ($_aizawa) arm mid dab . He ($_aizawa) 'd kept the arm entirely still so far , only wincing when Aizawa ($_aizawa) put the robe on him ($_aizawa) when he ($_aizawa) should have been hissing and maybe screaming . The_man ($_shouto) dug his ($_shouto) nails into his ($_shouto) palms and watched the shadows of the_boy ($_aizawa) and doctor . 
"
14763564,13,121,"`` He ($_shouto) ? '' 
"
14763564,13,122,"Shouto_'s ($_'s) eyes glanced down and he ($_'s) frowned . `` N-nevermind . It 's not important . '' 
"
14763564,13,123,"`` Whoever did this to you deserves time imprisoned , do you realise that ? '' 
"
14763564,13,124,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) watched as Shouto ($_shouto) knelt down to her ($_shouto) height and took her ($_shouto) frail old hand into his ($_shouto) , rubbing it against his ($_shouto) cheek affectionately . It seemed innocent our of context , almost as if the_boy ($_aizawa) had experience with a grandparent . 
"
14763564,13,125,"However , knowing the only man Shouto ($_shouto) had grown up with , the action became corrupt . Dirty. Wrong. 
"
14763564,13,126,"Recovery_Girl_'s ($_recovery) eye sight had been fading a lot as of late , but when she looked into the mismatched round eyes peering up into hers affectionately , her heart beat stopped for just a second . 
"
14763564,13,127,"Her mouth hung agape , those hauntingly beautiful eyes almost entrancing her to run her fingers against the cheek of the_boy_in_realisation ($_aizawa) that this was indeed the very baby she had helped to deliver almost two decades ago . 
"
14763564,13,128,"`` Oh , Sho . '' her voice melted in care and sadness that Shouto ($_shouto) could n't understand . He ($_shouto) blinked at her and continued his ($_shouto) oblivious point of saying . 
"
14763564,13,129,"`` It 's not important . '' 
"
14763564,13,130,"The old woman helped to push his elbow back into place and draped the robe back over him , before instructing him to lie down on the bed . Shouto ($_shouto) complied with all of this . Willing , unquestioning , looking at the woman as if she could do no wrong . 
"
14763564,13,131,"Finally , she brushed his hair out of his face and placed a kiss on his forehead . The impact of her magic had his fingers clenching into the bed suddenly , before his head tilted back and he slipped away into sleep . 
"
14763564,13,132,"She sighed forlornly . `` If only your mother knew what had become of you . I 'm sure she is writhing in the heavens . '' 
"
14763564,13,133,"When Aizawa ($_aizawa) was invited back in , they shared a low spoken conversation about Shouto ($_shouto) and his ($_shouto) relationship with his ($_shouto) father , one not intended for the ears of the long forgotten fairy hidden away in the sleeping Prince 's pocket . 
"
14763564,13,134,"`` We ca n't let this go through ... I feel a failure enough that it 's already gone on as long as it has . '' 
"
14763564,13,135,"Aizawa ($_aizawa) felt the anger flush in him ($_shouto) again . This time , some of it directed at himself ($_shouto) as a failure as well as the king . He ($_shouto) spoke without hesitation or fear . 
"
14763564,13,136,"`` It wo n't . I 'm going to stop this . '' 
"
14763564,13,137,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) slipped from the house after less than an hour of rest - before his ($_katsuki) brothers were back for sure . He ($_katsuki) had new clothes on his ($_katsuki) skin and a bag packed with enough stuff to last him ($_katsuki) until he ($_katsuki) 'd at least found a new place . 
"
14763564,13,138,"Somewhere warm and sunny. Somewhere away from these bastards . Somewhere without Shouto ($_shouto) . 
"
14763564,13,139,"He ($_katsuki) 'd ran into the bug on his ($_katsuki) travels . The thing was shaking and crying rivers as it tried to ask him ($_katsuki) where Shouto ($_shouto) was . 
"
14763564,13,140,"When he ($_katsuki) flicked it in the stomach and told it to fuck off back to the king , the bug had made a face so contorted with terror it had stuck in his ($_katsuki) mind , before it charged back at him ($_katsuki) and grabbed a lock of his ($_katsuki) hair , yanking his ($_katsuki) head back hard and screaming at him ($_katsuki) for being a ` pathetic , evil traitor . ' 
"
14763564,13,141,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) let it , until it said four words that had his ($_katsuki) head reeling . 
"
14763564,13,142,"`` You 're better this this . '' 
"
14763564,13,143,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) spun around and grabbed it by the stomach , `` Fuck off back to your whore prince ! '' 
"
14763564,13,144,"He ($_katsuki) could n't stop thinking about that expression . About how despite all his ($_katsuki) insults and attempts to drive the creature away , it was those words that had sent it off in a flash of green light . 
"
14763564,13,145,"Why?! 
"
14763564,13,146,"If the_Prince ($_the) was with his ($_the) father in the safest building in the country , what was the fucking issue ? 
"
14763564,13,147,"`` FUCK ! '' His ($_the) fist slammed into a tree beside him ($_the) for no apparent reason . 
"
14763564,13,148,"Frustation . It flowed through him ($_the) and out of his ($_the) fingertips in sparks ; something was wrong and he ($_the) knew it . It was on the tip of his ($_the) tongue and itching in a part of his ($_the) brain that he ($_the) could n't quite reach , screaming at him ($_the) to turn back and take Shouto ($_shouto) into his ($_the) arms where he ($_the) belonged . 
"
14763564,13,149,"Was it love or some sappy shit like that ? Was it protectiveness or was it a sense of danger ? 
"
14763564,13,150,"Whatever combination it was , it definitely left him ($_the) anxious . Twitching in fact . 
"
14763564,13,151,"But all logic pointed to the_King_'s ($_the) company being safe , why would his ($_the) instincts tell him ($_the) otherwise ? 
"
14763564,13,152,"These thoughts plagued his ($_the) mind on his ($_the) travels , growing as he ($_the) wondered the quiet forests alone . It was once an enjoyable task for him ($_the) , bounding over broken branches , trunks and animal homes . Now , he ($_the) found it eerily quiet and empty . He ($_the) was restless . 
"
14763564,13,153,"They 'd only travelled together for a day or two , and yet , he ($_the) found himself ($_the) often looking back to check if the_Prince ($_the) was keeping up . He ($_the) found himself ($_the) coming across various objects and imagining Shouto_'s ($_'s) curious , low voice asking what exactly it was . 
"
14763564,13,154,"At night , when he ($_the) curled up to sleep he ($_the) felt nothing but cold that no fire of his ($_the) own creation could warm . 
"
14763564,13,155,"So on the_second_day ($_the) , he ($_the) stole a horse and hoped the wind would race his ($_the) thoughts to the back of his ($_the) head and keep them there . As if the miles between them would make him ($_the) forget . 
"
14763564,13,156,"On the_third_day ($_the) , he ($_the) filled his ($_the) head with alcohol . Bottles of it , flooding his ($_the) brain against his ($_the) every oath to remain in healthy - turning his ($_the) words into gargles even in his ($_the) head . He ($_the) was drunk-riding , racing on the back of a horse in dangerous lands as a wanted criminal , and carrying dozens - no - hundreds of gold . 
"
14763564,13,157,"If his ($_the) mother was here , she would slap him ($_the) . 
"
14763564,13,158,"Even harder if she knew that even through this all , he ($_the) was still thinking hard about the_boy ($_aizawa) he ($_the) had betrayed . 
"
14763564,13,159,"That evening he ($_the) hooked up with some girl - a redhead with a short bob and a tatoo over her left eye . Her mouth had tasted roar and dull , like room temperature beer . 
"
14763564,13,160,"He ($_the) 'd yanked away from her after only a few forced kisses , leaving her flushed and waiting for more against the nearest shed wall , confused as to why he ($_the) was storming away . 
"
14763564,13,161,"The morning of the_fourth_day ($_the) , he ($_the) 'd left both of his ($_the) escapism , sitting sober on the ground beside his ($_the) horse trying to clear his ($_the) head . 
"
14763564,13,162,"By coincidence , he ($_the) leaned back against a false wall and fell face first into a clearing , looking at it upside down . This pissed him ($_the) off incredibly . 
"
14763564,13,163,"At first he ($_the) 'd thought that time had been reversed , that he ($_the) 'd find himself ($_the) being chased by horse-face and given a second chance to do it all again differently . 
"
14763564,13,164,"Would he ($_the) kidnap the_Prince ($_the) and take him ($_the) somewhere else where the father would never find them ? Would he ($_the) tell the old king to go fuck himself ($_the) and treat the_Prince ($_the) how he ($_the) really wanted to ? Would he ($_the) look into Shouto_'s ($_'s) eyes on that boat and never put the anchor down again , sailing away until it was just the two of them somewhere far away from this cursed king and cursed land ? 
"
14763564,13,165,"His ($_the) hopes lifted him ($_the) like wings , he ($_the) stood renewed , eager to charge up into that tower , take his ($_the) his_prince ($_the) into his ($_the) arms and for once in his ($_the) life return the declarations that the_prince ($_the) had given him ($_the) . 
"
14763564,13,166,"Only to stop as the world crashed down on his ($_the) childish , petty little hopes mockingly . 
"
14763564,13,167,"This clearing was vastly different . It was almost grey . Rocks only , tired grass , clear water and white flowers . 
"
14763564,13,168,"Colourless and dead. 
"
14763564,13,169,"The sun was n't shining at all , looking up to find only clouds . 
"
14763564,13,170,"Still , as if teasing him ($_the) there sat in the centre a tall and peculiar tower not at all too different from Shouto_'s ($_'s) . 
"
14763564,13,171,"Deciding to humour fate , who seemed to be laughing in his ($_the) expense , he ($_the) decided to climb it . 
"
14763564,13,172,"Sure. Why not. Maybe he ($_the) 'd find a new prince of a new land . Maybe with this one he ($_the) would n't fuck up nearly as much . 
"
14763564,13,173,"It was dark inside , leaving him ($_the) to look around blindly . He ($_the) waited for the pang of a metal pan to collide with his ($_the) head , clenching shut his ($_the) eyes and counting to ten . 
"
14763564,13,174,"It never came . 
"
14763564,13,175,"Instead , there was a warm , amused voice quietly commenting from within . 
"
14763564,13,176,"`` I was gon na hit you ... then you shut your eyes like that and you just looked so cute I could n't . '' 
"
14763564,13,177,"He turned sharply on his heel and for a second , thought he was looking into the mystical grey eye of Shouto . The shape of the face , the hair , even the expression for a second looked strikingly similar . 
"
14763564,13,178,"Instead , he found the felt he was seeing a ghost . 
"
14763564,13,179,"`` No fucking way ... '' He whispered . `` Queen - '' 
"
14763564,13,180,"`` That 's right . '' She smiled , eyes wrinkling in the corners . `` Guess I do n't have to explain after all . ''
