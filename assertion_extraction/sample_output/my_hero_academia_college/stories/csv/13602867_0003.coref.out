"
13602867,3,2,"Sucking noises were echoing the room . 
"
13602867,3,3,"STOP ! PLEASE STOP ! 
"
13602867,3,4,"The man beneath the stranger wasn t noticing the screams . 
"
13602867,3,5,"GET AWAY! 
"
13602867,3,6,"A man with spiky red hair had immediately stopped his attempts on pleasuring his partner , only just realizing the situation . 
"
13602867,3,7,"Shit ! I m so sorry man . I. . I didn t realize ! Are you ok 
"
13602867,3,8,"Christ your teeth ! the stranger had started to buckle his pants . 
"
13602867,3,9,"Wait , what are you doing ? 
"
13602867,3,10,"I can t do this ! It s too bloody painful . 
"
13602867,3,11,"Wait! I haven t done it for so long ! I need you ! 
"
13602867,3,12,"You need a bloody sadist ! If you can t control how you use your teeth than I ain t staying to see when you lose control of your gift . 
"
13602867,3,13,"I m really sorry . I hope I didn t - . The stranger had walked out of the huge tent , leaving the red head with an erection . 
"
13602867,3,14,"He sighed and forced his hand to give him his needed release . By the end of it , the red-haired man found himself unsatisfied once again . 
"
13602867,3,15,"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
"
13602867,3,16,"Where the fuck is he ? 
"
13602867,3,17,"Well , I saw him take a pretty guy with him to his tent . You and I both now what that means ? 
"
13602867,3,18,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) was ready to shoot lasers out of his ($_katsuki) eyes towards the pink demon like girl . 
"
13602867,3,19,"I FUCKING DIDN T NEED TO KNOW THAT MUCH ! JUST SAY HE ($_katsuki) S BUSY IN HIS ($_katsuki) TENT NEXT TIME ! 
"
13602867,3,20,"What? You permitted same sex activities in the_tribe ($_the) . I wouldn t think the_great_King ($_the) would be so flustered to hear that it would actually be going on with his ($_the) subjects . 
"
13602867,3,21,"I allowed it so no good fighters gets killed because of something so stupid . People shouldn t have to die based on who they want to mate with , Katsuki ($_katsuki) starts pulling at the girl s hair , but that doesn t mean I want to know when they are doing it Black Eyes . 
"
13602867,3,22,"The girl yelped until Katsuki ($_katsuki) let girl . Out of anger she responded the darkest secret she knew she shouldn t have said . 
"
13602867,3,23,"Mate ?! Your thinking more Dragon_than_Human ($_than) , and you re especially thinking about it ($_than) towards a green haired man . 
"
13602867,3,24,"The fuck you said Pinky ?! 
"
13602867,3,25,"You think I didn t notice why you check every Green Haired guy before we make them into slaves or feed them to the dragons ? This isn t because of a green fetish harem , you re looking for a specific greeny ! And you re not doing it to reunite yourselves just as friends . Your planning to do a dragon bond the moment you get your hands on him . 
"
13602867,3,26,"And what makes you such a fucking expert ? 
"
13602867,3,27,"Three clues ! One , you never ask anyone to be with you at night . So , without a doubt , our_great_King ($_king) s a virgin , saving himself ($_king) for a certain someone . Two , the only people you ever have interest in is green haired dudes who you need to check before we do anything to them , which you have denied every-one we bring , which support my belief that there is a certain someone you re saving youself for . And three , you ve ordered the great Warlord Tokoyami to learn every Dragon Ritual that involves a second participant . 
"
13602867,3,28,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) stared at her ($_katsuki) , a look that said murder was spread all over his ($_katsuki) face , the girl knew this was now her ($_katsuki) end . 
"
13602867,3,29,"Well , at least I was right 
"
13602867,3,30,"Your wrong . I am not looking for a Green Haired man to mate him ($_katsuki) . That one is dead , I am looking for the Green Haired man who is the reason for killing his ($_katsuki) own wife and son . 
"
13602867,3,31,"The pink girl started to feel heat and death surround her . 
"
13602867,3,32,"The Man who left his family alone to die , who decided to be a Knight and protecting others than doing a_Husband ($_a) s job of protecting his ($_a) family was the right choice . A Man whose only detail I have of him ($_a) , is that he ($_a) had Green Hair just like the rest of his ($_a) dead family , which I had to dig out from my old hag , is still walking around while he ($_a) let my Mate die . 
"
13602867,3,33,"Yep , this is how Pink girl was going to die , she felt it and knew that if it wasn t from a battle , it would be from her big mouth . 
"
13602867,3,34,"And what I had Emo-Bird do was to help me posses the Dragon s ability to temporarily see a person s past in every ritual I do with them . So , than I know for sure that the Man that fucked up my life with my Bride will not slip from my fucking hand just as he slipped out of my Bride s life and let him die ! 
"
13602867,3,35,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) than shot an explosion towards the direction of what would have been the red spiky haired man s tent . 
"
13602867,3,36,"I didn t think Ejirou ($_ejirou) deserved that . The pink girl figured those would be noble words to die on . 
"
13602867,3,37,"He shouldn t have decided to do his own business the same time we do our meetings . Katsuki ($_katsuki) than stormed out of the leaders circle within the forest . Leaving the pink girl on her ($_katsuki) own . 
"
13602867,3,38,"MINA ($_mina) ! Ejirou ($_ejirou) s voice screeched out . Oh god I am so sorry I m late ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) didn t burn anything because of me yet ? 
"
13602867,3,39,"Well , it may not have been because of you . Mina ($_mina) wasn t sure how she ($_mina) would explain the direction of the shot . 
"
13602867,3,40,"Oh god , where did he shoot this time ? Crap . Better pull it off quick like an arrow . 
"
13602867,3,41,"He shot towards your tent . Within that second , Ejirou ($_ejirou) ran right back from the direction he came from . Mina ($_mina) ran straight after him . 
"
13602867,3,42,"Was this seriously because I came a little late . I mean that s kinda crossing the line here . Ejirou ($_ejirou) asked while he ($_ejirou) ran . 
"
13602867,3,43,"It may have been my fault he ($_ejirou) shot it at your tent . 
"
13602867,3,44,"The Fuck ! What did you say ? 
"
13602867,3,45,"Mina ($_mina) s face was started to go red , and it wasn t because of running to start with , I did mention that you were having fun with a cutie . 
"
13602867,3,46,"Oh , well thanks for having my bloody back traitor . 
"
13602867,3,47,"That s not the bit way he ($_ejirou) tried to burn your tent . The both continued towards his ($_ejirou) tent , not far long until they get to see the damage . 
"
13602867,3,48,"Than what s the bloody bit ! 
"
13602867,3,49,"It was because I tried to talk to him ($_ejirou) about the green haired man he ($_ejirou) s looking for . 
"
13602867,3,50,"And! What did you say ?! 
"
13602867,3,51,"I asked him ($_ejirou) if he ($_ejirou) was looking for a lover who he ($_ejirou) will do a dragon bond with ! 
"
13602867,3,52,"They both finally made it to Ejirou s tent , they found that the smoke was coming a little further away from his tent . Was that an accident or on purpose ? 
"
13602867,3,53,"So what , you found out about it and he thought I told you ? That s the reason he almost tried to kill me ? I mean what if I was actually in there with a guy and he actually did land that fireball on us ? 
"
13602867,3,54,"Wait , what do you mean found out ? You know about it ? 
"
13602867,3,55,"Yeah , the green haired kid at what used to be Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) . He was the same age as us and he only played with Katsuki ($_katsuki) as kids , I never met him , but back then I didn t even meet Katsuki ($_katsuki) . Only word about the Dragon ($_dragon) heir befriending an outsider was still good gossip for every mom in the_tribe ($_the) . That s how i already know about the two of them beforeI even met them . 
"
13602867,3,56,"Mina ($_mina) got a little confused at the mention of the_old_village ($_mikumo) . Explain Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) ! It s the place we re at now ? So what happened to the kid ? 
"
13602867,3,57,"Well , we re kinda at Mikumo ($_mikumo) , we re just a little further away on the side of where Mikumo ($_mikumo) used to be . Katsuki ($_katsuki) couldn t stand what happened to it or stay right at the place where he ($_mikumo) lost the kid that used to live there , so he ($_mikumo) laid our tribe to stay around the cave closet to it . 
"
13602867,3,58,"I know that the cave he ($_mikumo) s living in now is what he ($_mikumo) marked the end of the_tribe ($_the) s radius . I don t need that explanation ! I want tot know what happened to the actual village ! 
"
13602867,3,59,"Oh Ejirou started to show a grimm expression . It happened before you joined our Tribe . You see , when the_Tribe ($_the) came back to Mikumo . The_village ($_mikumo) was covered between smoke and carcases . The_village ($_mikumo) was burnt down . As if a_Dragon ($_a) had actually devoured the_whole_village ($_mikumo) . 
"
13602867,3,60,"So , a_Dragon ($_a) killed the_Dragon_King ($_the) s male Bride ? A little ironic? 
"
13602867,3,61,"No , it s not . Ejirou ($_ejirou) gave a harsh look at Mina ($_mina) , this was not a something to joke with . Apparently Dragon s do have the ability to look at a person s whole life from past to future . And , as much as those gossiping moms like dirt , word got around that Katsuki was planning to marry that kid . If that was true , then if one_dragon ($_the) did look at Katsuki ($_katsuki) s life , they ($_the) would know for sure of his ($_katsuki) intentions and how far they ($_the) would go . Being a soon to be Dragon ($_dragon) King , one of those_Dragons ($_the) must have thought it ($_the) best to instead of killing Katsuki ($_katsuki) and risk losing a powerful heir . That 
"
13602867,3,62,"Mina ($_mina) looked with her ($_mina) wide black eyes . There s no way an actual Dragon would - 
"
13602867,3,63,"They would do anything to protect the bloodline ! They do what they must to keep it pure and growing , anything that disrupts that will be what everything becomes when scorching flames are released onto it . That s why anyone who doesn t follow Dragon_law ($_law) must be sacrificed . 
"
13602867,3,64,"So , what about you then , you re only into guys ! If_Dragon_Law ($_law) says that two people of the same sex can t be together , how did Katsuki ($_katsuki) stopped them from killing you ? 
"
13602867,3,65,"Simple that law is not actual Dragon_Law ($_law) . The two same sex couples can t be together is the Akatani Tribe law , it was made to ensure that people didn t disobey the real Dragon law which is that those with dragon blood within the_tribe ($_the) must not weaken in numbers . The_dragons ($_the) made that law because they ($_the) are rare creatures who need protection from the all changing gifts that appear within each generation . People hunt Dragons as a mere game , and those who have Dragon blood like me can only sense when they are endanger . The_dragon_King ($_the) , however , can communicate to them and even command them if he ($_the) is respected amongst the_Dragons ($_the) . Katsuki ($_katsuki) managed to convince the_tribe ($_the) that killing me would be disobeying the real Dragon Law , and that if I am spared will not only keep the numbers of the dragon blood but allow me time to eventually conceive with a woman thus growing the bloodline . 
"
13602867,3,66,"But you can t do it with a woman ? Can you ? 
"
13602867,3,67,"It doesn t matter , I will have to force myself soon otherwise , others might take action onto their own hands to please the_Dragons ($_the) and kill me off before they end up doing to us what they did to Mikumo . 
"
13602867,3,68,"I thought Dragons ($_dragons) were kind creatures , I wouldn t of believed you if you told me before that a_Dragon ($_a) would really destroy a whole village because of young love . 
"
13602867,3,69,"Well , there was no denying the work of Dragons caused the death of all those people . I guess Katskui ($_katskui) is checking every Green haired guy in hope that he ($_katskui) somehow survived . 
"
13602867,3,70,"Mina ($_mina) drawled her ($_mina) eyes down , that was not what Katsuki ($_katsuki) had told her ($_mina) . 
"
13602867,3,71,"the kid s father , he ($_katskui) had green hair right ? 
"
13602867,3,72,"Oh the Dad . Well nobody s knows . 
"
13602867,3,73,"Other than Katsuki ($_katsuki) s Mom ? 
"
13602867,3,74,"Oh , defiantly not Katsuki ($_katsuki) s mom 
"
13602867,3,75,"Now this is getting confusing again . Why not? Wouldn t she ($_mina) have met the kid s dad when their sons were friends ? 
"
13602867,3,76,"No , because Katsuki ($_katsuki) s mom was from Mikumo ($_mikumo) s village and when she ($_mina) came back with Katsuki ($_katsuki) her ($_mina) friend at Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) also had a son . The Father of that s friend son , who is the green haired kid , had to leave to provide for his new family while the tribe doesn t even depend on money for survival and were able to stay all together and travel to Mikumo . 
"
13602867,3,77,"Wait , how Katsuki ($_katsuki) s mom meet the_previous_Dragon_King ($_the) . 
"
13602867,3,78,"She ($_mina) left the_village ($_mikumo) for an adventure when she ($_mina) in her ($_mina) twenties and found the_Akatani_Tribe ($_the) . That s the story of how the_previous_King ($_the) gave the_dragons ($_the) the next heir from a woman from Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) . She ($_mina) didn t return to Mikumo until after Katsuki ($_katsuki) was born and that was only because they decided to allow him ($_katsuki) to grow up there and be part of his ($_katsuki) mother s village before he ($_katsuki) starts his ($_katsuki) intense training and travelling with Dragons ($_dragons) . 
"
13602867,3,79,"Too fast! Use simpler sentence Ejirou . He ($_katsuki) rolled his ($_katsuki) eyes as he ($_katsuki) tried to clarify again . 
"
13602867,3,80,"The only reason the_tribe ($_the) went to Mikumo Village was only so Katsuki ($_katsuki) could grow in a stable place . And that all happened after he ($_katsuki) was born . Which meant that if the green haired kid was also already born and his ($_katsuki) father had to leave the Village way before the_Akatani_Tribe ($_the) ever made it to Mikumo . 
"
13602867,3,81,"Sooooo???. 
"
13602867,3,82,"So , the kid s father had never met anyone from the_tribe ($_the) . No-one knows what he ($_katsuki) looks like to even know if he ($_katsuki) had green hair . And Katsuki ($_katsuki) knows this very well because he ($_katsuki) nagged his ($_katsuki) mom over and over for more information on that kid way before he ($_katsuki) returned to the village and found out he ($_katsuki) was dead . OK! 
"
13602867,3,83,"Ok . . 
"
13602867,3,84,"Fucking perfect than! 
"
13602867,3,85,"But one more thing 
"
13602867,3,86,"WHAT? 
"
13602867,3,87,"Actually two more things ? 
"
13602867,3,88,"FUCKING WHAT!? 
"
13602867,3,89,"First , how do you know so much about this stuff ? 
"
13602867,3,90,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) didn t want the_Dragon ($_the) s to succeed in erasing everything about Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) , it ($_the) s connections to the Akatani Tribe and even who his friend was and how they played a roll in both Katsuki ($_katsuki) and his ($_katsuki) mom s life . I partly believe that Katsuki ($_katsuki) s mom had a lot to do with keeping Mikumo_Village ($_mikumo) s alive since both she ($_katsuki) and Katsuki ($_katsuki) were the ones who had added it ($_mikumo) s story to the tribes record keepers . And being made bloody sure that they spent every night of my bloody childhood telling stories of that damn villages and our connections to THEM ! AND I KNOW FOR BLOODY SURE THAT THE DAD WAS NEVER MENTIONED ! 
"
13602867,3,91,"Ok , and last one 
"
13602867,3,92,"WHAT! 
"
13602867,3,93,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) lied to me about trying to find the boy and was instead trying to find the father who he ($_katsuki) believed to also have green hair . Why would he ($_katsuki) say that ? 
"
13602867,3,94,"Ejirou ($_ejirou) was really confused about that one . Why would he ($_katsuki) say he ($_katsuki) looking for the father ? There is no way he ($_katsuki) could tell if he ($_katsuki) had green hair , especially when the stories were told that the green hair was from the mother . So , the father could easily have a different colour hair . Besides , he ($_katsuki) was Katsuki ($_katsuki) s closest friend , he ($_katsuki) already knew that the search for the_green_haired_man ($_katsuki) was only for the boy . 
"
13602867,3,95,"What else did he ($_katsuki) say ? 
"
13602867,3,96,"He ($_katsuki) said he ($_katsuki) was planning to find the father to kill him ($_katsuki) for not protecting his ($_katsuki) mate 
"
13602867,3,97,"Mate ? He ($_katsuki) used mate ? 
"
13602867,3,98,"Yeah , that is not a term Katsuki ($_katsuki) would use on that kid 
"
13602867,3,99,"well he ($_katsuki) said mate - 
"
13602867,3,100,"he ($_katsuki) calls him ($_katsuki) by Bride . The boy is only ever addressed as His Bride , to use Mate is the Dragon s way of saying wife . 
"
13602867,3,101,"So , he ($_katsuki) got the two mixed up 
"
13602867,3,102,"Ejirou ($_ejirou) knows better than that . 
"
13602867,3,103,"And he ($_katsuki) said he ($_katsuki) wants to kill the father of his ($_katsuki) bride . Katsuki ($_katsuki) only ever wanted to do was learn more about that kid , he ($_katsuki) wouldn t want to kill the only thing left of him ($_katsuki) . 
"
13602867,3,104,"He ($_katsuki) said he ($_katsuki) needed to die for not protecting his ($_katsuki) family 
"
13602867,3,105,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) s knows better than that . All he ($_katsuki) wanted to do was preserve as much of that kid as possible . Killing off his ($_katsuki) Dad would ruin all his ($_katsuki) attempts of knowing anything more about him ($_katsuki) . 
"
13602867,3,106,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) is a hot headed , he ($_katsuki) could just be saying that or even lying to throw me of after realising I knew the truth . 
"
13602867,3,107,"He ($_katsuki) s kept it secret that he ($_katsuki) was looking for his ($_katsuki) friend from the whole tribe . Did everything he ($_katsuki) could so people won t believe that he ($_katsuki) would ve married that kid if he ($_katsuki) did survive . But what he ($_katsuki) said to you isn t just to keep you from knowing all that . 
"
13602867,3,108,"All he ($_katsuki) ever said was that he ($_katsuki) wants to find that kid , right ? So , to change it around as finding the father instead may appear that he ($_katsuki) is losing hope . 
"
13602867,3,109,"it s been years right , eventually everyone would lose hope 
"
13602867,3,110,"Yeah , but when you lose hope you go into despair . 
"
13602867,3,111,"yeah . He ($_katsuki) ll pull through eventually . 
"
13602867,3,112,"that s what I m most afraid of . If he ($_katsuki) falls into despair , will he ($_katsuki) pull through ? Or would something more dangerous take advantage of him ($_katsuki) before he ($_katsuki) can get to . 
"
13602867,3,113,"it s not like anyone can actually hurt Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
"
13602867,3,114,"Physically , no . But mentally?????????
