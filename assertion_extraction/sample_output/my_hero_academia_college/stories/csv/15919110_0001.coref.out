15919110,1,1,"The click of wooden heels on cobblestone was the only indication of life in the silent town . Burn marks scorched the stone walls and the acrid smell of smoke permeated every inch of the town . Haze clung in the humid air and made it hard to see , buildings came in and out of view as the procession moved forward . The clicking grew louder as a patrol of palace guards turned the corner to enter the abandoned marketplace . 
"
15919110,1,2,"The company had marched their way from the capital to this small town on the outskirts of the kingdom to investigate this very square . Their green haired captain led the way , stepping carefully around the broken carts and boarded shops . Every officer followed his lead , avoiding burnt piles of debris as they walked . 
"
15919110,1,3,"The captain signaled for his small band to break up and search the site . His team scattered across the square in pairs , looking for any telltale sign of the offender . 
"
15919110,1,4,"Staying in the main area , he took slow steps as he circled the giant crater of scorched earth . He ran his gloved hand over the burnt stone . Soot collected on his white gloves and he rubbed his fingers together absently . The soot spread , stain sinking into the fibers , but he paid it no mind . Emerald eyes stayed transfixed on the rough painting of a dragon on vellum and nailed haphazardly to the wall . His woolen , black greatcoat pulled at the shoulders as he reached for one of the numerous wanted posters . 
"
15919110,1,5,"The captain eyed the poster , bold lines outlined the sharp claws and vicious fangs of an orange dragon . Under the picture sat angled text claiming a reward from King Endeavor himself for its head : the hand of the crown prince . 
"
15919110,1,6,"The yellowing vellum rustled in the gentle breeze and sounded almost calming to the captain s ears . A sound that belied the horror printed on each sheet . His nose wrinkled at the scent of death and smoke carried on the wind . He pulled his silk cravat over his nose to block the stench . 
"
15919110,1,7,"Izu - I mean , Captain Midoriya ! a voice called out . An officer with an identical red cravat but wearing grey greatcoat that told of her lower rank , jogged over . 
"
15919110,1,8,"Midoriya Izuku turned from the posters to raise an eyebrow at the officer . What is it , Uraraka ? 
"
15919110,1,9,"They ve found something , she panted . She must ve ran from the other side of the market to tell him with how out of breath she was . 
"
15919110,1,10,"Excitement and worry sprang up in his heart and Izuku nodded . Take me there . 
"
15919110,1,11,"
"
15919110,1,12,"The warning bells rang from the outskirts of the city and traveled their way to the castle , peeling out from the streets and ricocheting in a jumbled cacophony off the the castle walls . 
"
15919110,1,13,"Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) closed the shutters with a rattle , muffling the racket from the street below . Another dragon attack . He ($_shouto) d begged the royal priest to have the gods smite the dragon themselves , but it seems the gods did not listen to selfish requests . Shouto ($_shouto) s heart thumped against his ($_shouto) chest , its ($_shouto) true that his ($_shouto) uncharacteristic visits to the priest were not wholly on behalf of his ($_shouto) suffering populous . 
"
15919110,1,14,"Tugging on the embroidered bell pull twice , he ($_shouto) called his ($_shouto) valet . It was only a moment before a curt rapping sounded at the door . 
"
15919110,1,15,"Enter. 
"
15919110,1,16,"A young man similar in age and stature to the prince stepped through the carved doors . Besides those two features the prince s valet could not be more different than the prince himself . The valet was liken to a shadow at the prince s side . Slicked , black hair pulled away from a curved nose and high cheekbones . The valet s appearance was sharp and fierce and only made more so by an enormous black bird that sat on his shoulder . More than once a courtier had mistaken the bird for the valet s own head and fainted . 
"
15919110,1,17,"Thank goodness , Tokyo ! Dress me , I need to speak with father . 
"
15919110,1,18,"Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) bowed slightly , red eyes flashing . It might be unwise to approach his ($_tokoyami) majesty at this time . 
"
15919110,1,19,"Shouto ($_shouto) hesitated for a moment at his ($_shouto) servant and friend s warning , but ultimately shook his ($_shouto) head . I know , and I appreciate you trying to protect me . But this is my future at stake , I must try . 
"
15919110,1,20,"A red eye flicked to the black bird who seemed to shrug in answer . Fine , but let me send Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) with you . 
"
15919110,1,21,"Thank you , my dear friend . He squeezed Tokoyami_'s ($_tokoyami) free shoulder . The prince 's stiff shoulders relaxed and his eyes softened for an instant before his royal mask slid back in place . Now , let 's face the king . 
"
15919110,1,22,"King Endeavor stood in the center of the war room like a bonfire . Without having to do anything , he demanded attention from all present . The kingdom 's greatest knights and heroes encircled the strategy table arguing about how best to defeat a dragon . But , all paled to the king like river stones encircling a ruby . 
"
15919110,1,23,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) was tall for his nineteen years , yet he felt dwarfed by not only the size of the room 's occupants but also their power . He could feel it like a tangible thing , rolling off them in waves . 
"
15919110,1,24,"All speaking ceased and Endeavor ($_endeavor) raised a red eyebrow at his son 's entrance . 
"
15919110,1,25,"Shouto ($_shouto) looked for the shadow-like bird that perched on the rafters . Give me strength , he asked with his eyes . His silent plea seemed to be understood by Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) and Shouto ($_shouto) took comfort in its presence . Dual colored eyes locked on the king and he squared his shoulders . 
"
15919110,1,26,"I 've come to formally request that the dragon slayer be rewarded with my own personal treasure , Shouto_'s ($_'s) clear tenor rang pure against the sparsely decorated walls . 
"
15919110,1,27,"Endeavor 's countenance darkened and the room seemed to set ablaze under his piercing gaze . The reward has already been determined . I will not pass up this opportunity to find a powerful suitor to become your bride . 
"
15919110,1,28,"I should be able to find my own person in my own time . Why use our people as a means to ensuring the power in the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line ? Our people are not there as fodder for your trial and I refuse to be apart of it ! Shouto_'s ($_'s) voice rose against his ($_'s) will , anger fanning the flame inside him ($_'s) . 
"
15919110,1,29,"A crack rattled the few armaments that decorated the walls and Shouto thought a dragon attack was upon the castle . He ($_'s) looked around , but the room was whole and there was no sign of dragon fire . When he ($_'s) d spotted the source of the thunderous boom , he ($_'s) schooled his ($_'s) facial expression to one of cold neutrality , but fire burned behind his ($_'s) eyes . Two large dents , like craters under each hand , scared the wood of the war room table . The boom was the wood snapping under the king 's fists . 
"
15919110,1,30,"I will have you tried for treason to the crown if you say another word ! Endeavor_'s ($_endeavor) voice boomed in the small space , You will marry who I please and the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line will become more powerful . My word is law . 
"
15919110,1,31,"Shouto ($_shouto) shivered under the sheer force of his ($_shouto) father 's words . He ($_shouto) was careful not to reach for the scar on his ($_shouto) face . The one put there as a reminder that he ($_shouto) , too , would one day become a tyrant . 
"
15919110,1,32,"As you wish , father , he ($_shouto) spat . Ice spread across his ($_shouto) features , cold and unfeeling . 
"
15919110,1,33,"Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) swooped down , spreading its ($_shadow) enormous wings as it ($_shadow) landed on Shouto_'s ($_'s) shoulder . It ($_shadow) created a silhouette of an avenging angel and a few heroes averted their eyes despite themselves . Some stray black and glossy feathers fluttered to the ground before the bird screeched . Shouto ($_shouto) could see some of the heroes cover their ears before his ($_shouto) vision was engulfed by black wings . In a flurry of feathers and tendrils of shadow , Shouto ($_shouto) was swept from the room . The magic left an earthy musk behind . 
"
15919110,1,34,"Shouto ($_shouto) stood wide-eyed in front of Tokoyami , cold hatred melting into tears down his ($_shouto) cheek . 
"
15919110,1,35,"The mage opened his arms and Shouto ($_shouto) fell into them with silent sobs . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) stroked the soft white and red hair as he ($_tokoyami) sent Dark Shadow worried glances . 
"
15919110,1,36,"Altercations with his ($_tokoyami) father never left the prince in the best of conditions , but this seemed worse than ever . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) squeeze his ($_tokoyami) prince and childhood friend to his ($_tokoyami) chest . He ($_tokoyami) ran soothing circles across Shouto ($_shouto) s back and waited until the tears abated . With a soft voice like the flapping of wings , he ($_tokoyami) whispered , I ($_tokoyami) have an idea where you can do as your father commands and deny him ($_tokoyami) the joy of controlling you . 
"
15919110,1,37,"Shouto ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) head , eyes dry but the remains of his ($_shouto) breakdown still visible in the russet of his ($_shouto) cheeks and the pallor that dampened his ($_shouto) skin . Tell me ($_tokoyami) .
