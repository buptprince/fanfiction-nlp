15122435,3,1,"Goodness , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , you ($_katsuki) are such a fool ! What were you ($_katsuki) thinking , going out unannounced and shirking your ($_katsuki) duties ? You ($_katsuki) have a reputation to uphold . You ($_katsuki) have this family s name to uphold . 
"
15122435,3,2,"Yes , Mother ($_mother) Mother_,_Katsuki ($_mother) says , his head bowed to hide the irritated expression on his face as he half-heartedly listens to her ($_mother) lecture that , on a semi-related note , is not unlike the countless lectures she ($_mother) 's given him prior to tonight . I understand . Next time I ll announce my departure from the village . Would that help ease your ($_katsuki) worries ? 
"
15122435,3,3,"Well , yes , a heads up would be rather Wait , what do you ($_katsuki) mean next time ? Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) demands , glaring down at her ($_mother) son . She ($_mother) plants her ($_mother) hands on her ($_mother) hips , lips pursed . You ($_katsuki) are not to leave the village again unless it s an emergency , and , as I can likely guess She ($_mother) carefully examines Katsuki ($_katsuki) s form , ruffled hair and dirtied cape and all . What was it you ($_katsuki) were doing out there that put you ($_katsuki) in this disheveled state , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ? 
"
15122435,3,4,"Another man , is the smug reply that first come to_Katsuki ($_katsuki) s mind , and he has to fight the grin that forms on his lips . A rather successful mission it turned out to be , if I do say so myself . Out loud , he voices , Nothing . I was simply exploring the forest . Is that not allowed? 
"
15122435,3,5,"But he already knows the answer to that . 
"
15122435,3,6,"Technically ($_technically) , it ($_technically) is n't . However , as royalty Katsuki ($_katsuki) sees that he is above such distasteful rules . It ($_technically) wo n't be long until I m the one that will be making these rules Fitting . 
"
15122435,3,7,"For the people in this village , it s strictly forbidden , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) answers after a moment , confirming what Katsuki ($_katsuki) had already been thinking . For a_Bakugou ($_a) , it ($_a) is n't but who s to say I wo n't be able to simply take this right away from you ($_katsuki) should I feel it necessary ? 
"
15122435,3,8,"Mother ($_mother) 
"
15122435,3,9,"I will be having none of that , she interrupts , tone rising . Pointing an accusatory finger at him , she adds , You ($_katsuki) ve been doing this since you ($_katsuki) were a child , leaving for hours at a time and returning with no explanation , acting as if there was no need to justify yourself . What if you ($_katsuki) were to get harmed while on your ($_katsuki) own , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ? What would I ($_katsuki) do were a guard to find your ($_katsuki) rotting corpse while on morning rounds ? 
"
15122435,3,10,"Please do n't say such stupid things , Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps , lifting his ($_katsuki) head to meet her ($_katsuki) gaze . Insulted. How weak does she ($_katsuki) believe I ($_katsuki) am ? I m strong enough to journey on my ($_katsuki) lonesome . It s never been an issue and it should n't be considered an issue now . I ($_katsuki) fail to see what the problem is . 
"
15122435,3,11,"Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) groans . The problem is that you ($_katsuki) 're almost an adult . On your ($_katsuki) eighteenth birthday the village is going to be throwing an entire festival in your ($_katsuki) honor and I ($_katsuki) expect you ($_katsuki) to be present for it ! Once me ($_katsuki) and your ($_katsuki) father officially hand you ($_katsuki) the crown oh , pray to God we re making the right decision on this all sneaking around will be henceforth prohibited . You ($_katsuki) must stay with your ($_katsuki) people ! 
"
15122435,3,12,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) wants to make a retort about how stupid that is but resists , swallowing the rage and shoving it deep down . His ($_katsuki) fingers clench around the dirt , the compound digging into his ($_katsuki) nails . That s fair . 
"
15122435,3,13,"Good , I m glad we ve reached an agreement on that at least . Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) turns her ($_mitsuki) head and looks out the door . When your ($_katsuki) father returns from the nightly hunting expedition I ($_katsuki) want you ($_katsuki) to explain to us what it is you ($_katsuki) ve been doing in the woods all these years . 
"
15122435,3,14,"Wait, what? 
"
15122435,3,15,"You ($_katsuki) heard me ($_katsuki) . Did you ($_katsuki) expect me ($_katsuki) to simply drop the issue altogether ? Laughable. My ($_katsuki) poor , immature son , she mutters , the statement apparently meant for her ears only . She pinches her nose . I ($_katsuki) hope the wife you ($_katsuki) find will be able to control that temper of yours ($_katsuki) Seems unlikely . 
"
15122435,3,16,"Hah . Like Katsuki hasn t heard that line before . The whole ` many beautiful women will be attending the festival , therefore giving you ($_katsuki) a wide berth to choose a bride from suggestion has become increasingly annoying in the months his mother s been drilling it into his head . Like it s that easy to choose a person you ($_katsuki) re to spend the rest of your ($_katsuki) life with 
"
15122435,3,17,"For him , the night for him to make his choice on a bride looms impossibly closer and he can practically feel the weight behind it applying tons of weight on his shoulders . Not to mention that no one can know that his virginity is n't exactly intact for the wedding night , nor that the person in question he d lost his virginity to is a man . 
"
15122435,3,18,"He s certain that Izuku is a bad influence on him . Just the thought of making love to a woman makes me sick to my stomach when it should n't . In fact , the opposite should be true . I should be disgusted thinking about him , but I m. . . not. He sighs aloud . I only wish he could see it the same way . 
"
15122435,3,19,"What s on your mind ? Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) asks , having spotted the sudden change in his ($_mitsuki) mood . You look sad . Is there something you need to discuss ? 
"
15122435,3,20,"No , do n't be stupid ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps , returning to his ($_katsuki) regular demeanor . He ($_katsuki) gets to his ($_katsuki) feet and brushes off the dust coating his ($_katsuki) hands , giving her ($_katsuki) the best glare he ($_katsuki) can muster . Mind your own damn business . 
"
15122435,3,21,"Do n't you dare talk to your mother that way ! Jeez , one would believe that I 've raised you better than this . Leaving your home , disregarding your people and failing to complete your duties as king What happened to you that made you this way ? 
"
15122435,3,22,"Deku . 
"
15122435,3,23,"There s no other reason . 
"
15122435,3,24,"It s like since the day we met his mere presence has had an everlasting effect on my life and the choices I make as a king . I should be horrified by the fact that this is horrible and he s right when he says it d be smarter to stop but he keeps drawing me back in with those eyes and I ca n't resist God , I ve turned into a monster . 
"
15122435,3,25,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) s so lost in thought he ($_katsuki) does n't notice Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) watching him ($_katsuki) , searching for an answer in his ($_katsuki) posture . 
"
15122435,3,26,"Then , as if by fate , the door to the hut slams open and Mina_Ashido ($_ashido) pokes her ($_ashido) head inside a member of the hunting group Masaru had left with . She ($_ashido) glances between Katsuki ($_katsuki) and Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) for a moment before seeming to remember her ($_ashido) place and bowing , announcing , My queen , my king there is news I would like to share . It s about King Masaru s group . We ve found something quite disturbing . 
"
15122435,3,27,"Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) is instantly on edge . What is it ? she ($_ashido) demands , stepping closer to the young woman in question . Where is my husband ? 
"
15122435,3,28,"He and the rest have n't returned yet pending an impromptu investigation , Mina ($_mina) explains formally , keeping her ($_mina) mannerisms at their peak . Her ($_ashido) hands are held together at her ($_ashido) front . They sent me to deliver a message ; we suspect there may be intruders coming suspiciously close to the village and , based on what we found It was n't a very pleasant sight . 
"
15122435,3,29,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) freezes . Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) asks , Well , what was it you ($_mitsuki) found ? 
"
15122435,3,30,"Mina ($_mina) takes several heartbeats to respond , an interval in which Katsuki ($_katsuki) internally panics . Shit , did they find the trap Deku fell in ? I made sure to repair it after I dropped him off at his village , but it s possible they may have found a disturbance . Damn it ! 
"
15122435,3,31,"It was a body . A dead body , Mina ($_mina) replies , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) s fear is replaced with shock . Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) claps a hand over her ($_mitsuki) mouth . We found it not too far north It was a young man , it seems , that was killed , but he s impossible to make out . Whoever killed him used fire his skin is so marred it 's unidentifiable . Not one of our kind , thank goodness , but there was something amiss . It might be a warning . 
"
15122435,3,32,"A warning ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) echoes . A warning for what ? 
"
15122435,3,33,"Well , Mina ($_mina) says nervously , a warning for us . At least , we assume so . The killer left a message behind . Scorched onto the tree were the words Leave our territory . 
"
15122435,3,34,"It s getting late . Katsuki ($_katsuki) can see the sun beginning to dip below the horizon as he ($_katsuki) swings at the overhanging vines with his ($_katsuki) sword , satisfied as the blade slices through them easily . The hit the ground and lie limp , dead , and he ($_katsuki) steps over them in a childish display of dominance . 
"
15122435,3,35,"Finding an animal , a task that should ve been simple in theory , is proving to be harder the longer he ($_katsuki) s out here . Almost nothing has appeared for him ($_katsuki) to slay , the two creatures he ($_katsuki) has spotted a deer and a bear being scared away due to his ($_katsuki) inability to shoot an arrow property though , in his ($_katsuki) defense , the second arrow had nearly nicked that bear . 
"
15122435,3,36,"Mother and Father will be wondering where I am soon , he ($_katsuki) thinks , and apts to find something prior to it getting completely dark . He ($_katsuki) walks slowly , keeping the sound he ($_katsuki) s making to a minimum , and ducks behind a bush to see if anything will come into view . He ($_katsuki) places his ($_katsuki) sword at his ($_katsuki) side in favor of grabbing the bow slung over his ($_katsuki) shoulder instead , inserting an arrow and waiting patiently . 
"
15122435,3,37,"Semi-patiently. 
"
15122435,3,38,"Not too patiently. 
"
15122435,3,39,"Impatiently. 
"
15122435,3,40,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) knees ache from digging into the ground , prompting him ($_katsuki) to shift slightly and readjust . Stupid animals , not wanting to be killed , he ($_katsuki) grumbles internally , huffing a frustrated breath . I need to do this . I need to prove I 'm a man , that I ll be the strongest king to have ever lived . If I don t , I ll be a failure . Mother would be so disappointed in me . Which is why he ($_katsuki) d appreciate it if the gods would bless him ($_katsuki) with something preferably large immediately . 
"
15122435,3,41,"So he ($_katsuki) waits . . 
"
15122435,3,42,"This outting is important for more than one reason , it being a rite of passage meant to represent his transition from boyhood to manhood . It 's meant to prove to his parents and his village that he s strong enough to become a proper ruler . But no one ever told me that waiting would be this loathsome , he thinks bitterly , hating that he has to remain in this uncomfortable position . 
"
15122435,3,43,"This is the first time he s been allowed to go out into Kage No Mori on his own , a great opportunity if there ever was one . Logically , there are precautionary measures set in place should he find himself in a bind and the situation goes from worse to worst , and his parents had advised it would wise to stay close to the village . Plus , should the case call for it , he can always use magic as a defensive mechanism . 
"
15122435,3,44,"Standing upright , he pads away to search for prey somewhere else . 
"
15122435,3,45,"He s been out hunting prior to today , having been out on several expeditions with his father s usual group . This is the reason behind him currently having the forest memorized , every step he takes being nothing less than certain and confident , further fueled by the fact that he will own it all one day . I ll be the person supervising the hunts and patrols , I ll make every major decision and my citizens will quickly be made the strongest in the world . 
"
15122435,3,46,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) continues strolling around for a while longer until he ($_katsuki) stumbles upon a small , circular clearing , the fireflies since coming out for the evening and providing an ominous illumination to the area . In a bout of childlike curiosity Katsuki ($_katsuki) grabs at one as its lit up , displeased as it escapes his ($_katsuki) grip by a hair and disappears . 
"
15122435,3,47,"There 's nothing interesting here , meaning it 's time to leave . Katsuki ($_katsuki) turns on his ($_katsuki) heels , heading out . It would be smart to return home so his ($_katsuki) parents do n't have to worry about him ($_katsuki) . 
"
15122435,3,48,"But , as if by some twisted , last-minute fate , a rustling sound begins to sound from the opposite end of the clearing and Katsuki ($_katsuki) goes on edge , scrambling to hide behind a tree and ready an arrow to shoot . He ($_katsuki) closes his ($_katsuki) mouth to keep his ($_katsuki) breathing quiet , heart thudding in anticipation . 
"
15122435,3,49,"A silhouette pushes through the thicket and enters the clearing clumsily , Katsuki ($_katsuki) loosing the arrow without thinking and watching as it catches his ($_katsuki) target s shoulder 
"
15122435,3,50,"Wait. That is n't right . 
"
15122435,3,51,"That s a person . 
"
15122435,3,52,"Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) satisfaction becomes a strong mortification as a blood curdling scream shakes the forest , chilling him ($_katsuki) straight to the bone . He ($_katsuki) rushes over to the figure , who has fallen to the ground and is writhing in pain , muttering half-hearted prayers in hope for mercy . 
"
15122435,3,53,"Oh my goodness , I did n't know anyone was out here ! I did n't mean to hurt you . Are you alright ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) s questions topple over each other as he ($_katsuki) approaches , extremely nervous . I never wanted to murder anyone ! 
"
15122435,3,54,"W-why ... why would you Ow , mutters the apparent victim , a boy seeming to around the same age as Katsuki ($_katsuki) . His hair is green and mussed , matching his eye color , and the clothes he wears signifies he s a peasant or someone else of the lower class . Someone Katsuki should not be associating with . 
"
15122435,3,55,"It was an accident ! No one is supposed to out here at night ! What are you doing ? 
"
15122435,3,56,"W-with friends , answers the boy , a hand planted over the injured shoulder . The arrow has gone through completely , a few inches over his chest , the pointed end being obscured from Katsuki ($_katsuki) s view . The blood that stains his shirt is black in the darkness . We w-were playing a game and I-I got lost . Thought I would find them but I got even more lost . Then ow this happened . You did this ! Ca n't you help me ? 
"
15122435,3,57,"I do n't know any healing magic , Katsuki ($_katsuki) retorts , feeling woozy just seeing the wound . Are n't you able to take it out yourself ? Why did n't you just make a light or something to find your friends ? It s basic magic . 
"
15122435,3,58,"The boy swallows , gaze half-lidded . Blood stains his fingertips as he pokes at the arrow , further cringing at the pain his touch ensues . T-that s I ca n't do any magic . 
"
15122435,3,59,"You ca n't what ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) , in full on panic mode , turns his ($_katsuki) head from side to side as if expecting assistance to show up at any second but , oh , right , they re the only two out here . He ($_katsuki) would have to return to his ($_katsuki) village and retrieve someone to remove the arrow and heal the boy s wound And yet It would be wrong to leave him ($_katsuki) here alone . 
"
15122435,3,60,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) bends down on his ($_katsuki) knees and gets a closer look at the penetrating arrow , not that examining it would be useful in this situation . Especially considering he ($_katsuki) knows next to nothing about medical magic . He ($_katsuki) ponders for a moment on what to do before an idea finally comes to mind . Albeit , a horrible one . 
"
15122435,3,61,"Hey , you , he ($_katsuki) says , we re gon na have to rip the arrow out . 
"
15122435,3,62,"The boy is instantly on edge , fighting against Katsuki ($_katsuki) s touch and slapping at his ($_katsuki) hands whenever they come near to the wound . No , you ca n't do that ! It s gon na hurt too much and I m gon na bleed ! Up close Katsuki ($_katsuki) can see that he ($_katsuki) s crying , tears staining his ($_katsuki) cheeks in twin streams . I never wanted this to happen ! I 'm too young to die ! 
"
15122435,3,63,"Quit being overdramatic , Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps , placing his ($_katsuki) weapons on the ground . You re not gon na die . I 'm not gon na let you die , you hear ? We just have to figure out a way for you to His ($_katsuki) gaze flickers to his ($_katsuki) bow . Wooden. He ($_katsuki) ponders . Hmm. 
"
15122435,3,64,"Then it hits him ($_katsuki) . Hold on a second , he ($_katsuki) tells the boy , and runs towards the nearest tree . Having to get on his ($_katsuki) tiptoes to reach the lowest branch , he ($_katsuki) snaps it off and quickly returns . Holding it over the boy s face , he ($_katsuki) says , I want you to bite on this . It s gon na hurt when I pull the arrow out . 
"
15122435,3,65,"W-what ? No , there has to be another way , there s no way I 'm doing that , I can t But the protest is cut off as Katsuki ($_katsuki) unceremoniously shoves the stick in his ($_katsuki) mouth and places both his ($_katsuki) hands on the arrow , one on the base where it digs into the boy s shoulder and the other at the end . Taking the hint , the boy bites down on the stick and squeezes his eyes shut , obviously prepared for the worst . 
"
15122435,3,66,"Okay , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says , I ll count . Three he tightens his grip , readying himself two the boy s expression tightens , likely out of fear one . And , in a single , swift motion he tugs the arrow out , the scream that the boy manages being stifled by the stick . 
"
15122435,3,67,"Letting the bloodied arrow drop to the ground , Katsuki ($_katsuki) immediately begins to apply pressure to the wound and keeps pressing down until the bleeding calms a little . The boy mutters something incomprehensible , prompting Katsuki ($_katsuki) to take the stick out his ($_katsuki) mouth . I-it s blood , I m bleeding I do n't want to 
"
15122435,3,68,"Shut up , I know . I can clearly see the blood , Katsuki ($_katsuki) replies , nodding towards his ($_katsuki) stained hands . That 's why I 'm gon na stop it from bleeding , then you 're gon na be fine . Holding an arm to his ($_katsuki) chest so the sleeve can hang loose , Katsuki ($_katsuki) uses his ($_katsuki) sword to cut it off and wrap up the boy s wound , looping the fabric around his ($_katsuki) armpit and over the shoulder . 
"
15122435,3,69,"Then , wiping the sweat from his ($_katsuki) forehead and not caring that it s leaving behind blood stains , Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks , How are you feeling ? 
"
15122435,3,70,"Like crap , replies the boy weakly , splaying his fingers over the makeshift bandage , a frown plastered over his features . His face is still exceptionally pale and his breathing is labored , but Katsuki ($_katsuki) can see that he is n't in as bad a condition as a few minutes ago , that which is a relief . 
"
15122435,3,71,"So , to get to the important part 
"
15122435,3,72,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) leans forward , gazing at the boy quite seriously . What are you ($_katsuki) doing out here ? 
"
15122435,3,73,"The boy flinches , caught off guard . I-I told you ($_katsuki) already that I was playing a game 
"
15122435,3,74,"Yes , I heard that part , but villagers are n't supposed to be wandering around the forest , especially at night ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps . Internally , he ($_katsuki) s excited he ($_katsuki) gets to put his ($_katsuki) royal command to use . Wait a second . I do n't think I 've seen you ($_katsuki) around the village before . Where do you ($_katsuki) live ? 
"
15122435,3,75,"The boy has to consider the question , eventually responding , I live in the village . Like you ($_katsuki) , do n't I ? 
"
15122435,3,76,"No , you ($_katsuki) don t , because I do n't recognize you ($_katsuki) , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says suspiciously , taking a step backwards . Did he ($_katsuki) just assist an intruder ? Does that make him ($_katsuki) disloyal to his ($_katsuki) people ? But I was only trying to help . After all , he ($_katsuki) s young like me Where are the friends you ($_katsuki) were talking about ? Who are they ? Who are you ($_katsuki) ? 
"
15122435,3,77,"Oh. Me ? I m Izuku . Izuku Midoriya . 
"
15122435,3,78,"The gears in Katsuki ($_katsuki) s head turn as he ($_katsuki) attempts to place the_name ($_the) , having memorized most family names in the village . Nothing . Nobody there has the_last_name_Midoriya ($_the) . 
"
15122435,3,79,"And ... and what about your ($_katsuki) friends ? 
"
15122435,3,80,"It hardly matters , Izuku ($_izuku) murmurs , rubbing his ($_izuku) injured shoulder with some discomfort , because I can already see that you ($_katsuki) have no idea who I am . I do n't know who you ($_katsuki) are , either . Are you ($_katsuki) sure we live in the same village ? 
"
15122435,3,81,"Well , it would make no sense if we did n't . There s only one village located in Kage No Mori , and it 's mine . 
"
15122435,3,82,"Yours ($_katsuki) ? Izuku ($_izuku) questions , tilting his ($_izuku) head . 
"
15122435,3,83,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) opens his ($_katsuki) mouth to answer , but Izuku ($_izuku) grunts and he ($_katsuki) stops , moving closer . What happened? Does your ($_katsuki) shoulder hurt ? 
"
15122435,3,84,"Izuku ($_izuku) nods . I feel like I 'm gon na die . 
"
15122435,3,85,"Do n't say that , you ($_katsuki) idiot ! You ($_katsuki) 're not gon na die , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says . You ($_katsuki) should listen to me when I tell you ($_katsuki) to do something . He ($_katsuki) swallows and glances upwards . It s gone dark . Come on , I should take you ($_katsuki) back to the village . A medical magic user there will fix you ($_katsuki) right up . He ($_katsuki) bends to retrieve his ($_katsuki) weapons . 
"
15122435,3,86,"I do n't wan na there s not quite right , says Izuku ($_izuku) between breathless groans , sitting upright and rubbing his ($_izuku) injury . Your ($_katsuki) village is n't mine I do n't think . 
"
15122435,3,87,"Hah ? What do you ($_katsuki) mean ? 
"
15122435,3,88,"You ($_katsuki) said yours ($_katsuki) , but my village is n't owned by anyone , Izuku ($_izuku) explains , plucking at the grass as a means to distract himself ($_izuku) from the pain . Our village leader supervises us , guides us . He ($_izuku) doesn t own us . Plus , people in my village do n't let children use swords like yours ($_katsuki) . We must live in different places . 
"
15122435,3,89,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) squints . Yeah? Then where do you ($_katsuki) live ? 
"
15122435,3,90,"In Kage No Mori , like you ($_katsuki) . 
"
15122435,3,91,"But that is n't possible ! Swinging his sword , Katsuki ($_katsuki) points it dangerously close to Izuku s nose . You ($_katsuki) re speaking the words of an insane person ! Are you ($_katsuki) trying to trick me ? You ($_katsuki) should n't trick the person that s to be your ($_katsuki) future king ! 
"
15122435,3,92,"And that 's just it , Izuku ($_izuku) tells him , sounding frustrated . My village does n't have a king or queen . Listen , I do n't have a proper explanation for you ($_katsuki) right now , and I 'm sorry , he adds cautiously , backing up at Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) glare , b-but what I do know is that I need to find my friends so I can go home . Can you ($_katsuki) help me ? Please? He gazes at Katsuki ($_katsuki) with wide , pleading eyes , leaving Katsuki ($_katsuki) more uncomfortable than he 's willing to admit . 
"
15122435,3,93,"Eugh Fine , Katsuki ($_katsuki) spits , turning his face away . Why does he keep looking at me like that ? How long ago did you ($_katsuki) lose them ? 
"
15122435,3,94,"Not long before you ($_katsuki) shot me with your ($_katsuki) arrow , Izuku ($_izuku) answers simply , meaning they should be within the vicinity somewhere . 
"
15122435,3,95,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) grunts . That makes things easy , but he should be at his village already . He s sure his mother is worried sick . Besides , this could be a trick . This boy could be luring me into a trap . 
"
15122435,3,96,"Despite having that thought in mind , however , Katsuki ($_katsuki) waves a hand and motions for Izuku ($_izuku) to follow behind him ($_katsuki) , saying , Let 's go . He ($_katsuki) does n't wait for Izuku ($_izuku) to get up , walking ahead , and after several seconds he ($_katsuki) hears gentle footsteps approaching from behind him ($_katsuki) . 
"
15122435,3,97,"It was really nice what you ($_katsuki) did for me , taking the arrow out and stuff , Izuku ($_izuku) says , his ($_izuku) cheeks flushed as he ($_izuku) matches Katsuki ($_katsuki) s stride . What a brave , stupid peasant . My shoulder still hurts , but I 'd probably be very lost if it was n't for us meeting so thank you ($_katsuki) . 
"
15122435,3,98,"Heh , naturally , Katsuki ($_katsuki) dismisses , accustomed to such praise . I 'm amazing . Allowing small explosions to go off in his ($_katsuki) palm , it provides some light as they walk together . He ($_katsuki) notices Izuku ($_izuku) staring at his ($_katsuki) hand in apparent fascination , and he ($_katsuki) grins and asks , Are you ($_katsuki) impressed ? 
"
15122435,3,99,"Izuku ($_izuku) smiles . Yeah! 
"
15122435,3,100,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) hesitates . Is he ($_katsuki) making fun of me ? But all he ($_katsuki) manages is Oh . 
"
15122435,3,101,"It s mainly quiet as they continue their trek , the main source of noise being the normal , forest-y sounds that Katsuki ($_katsuki) finds solace in however , not the same can be said for Izuku , who glances around nervously and jumps at every little thing , having a hard time swallowing his fear . He mutters a prayer under his breath and Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares at him . 
"
15122435,3,102,"Stop doing that , it s distracting , he demands , and Izuku ($_izuku) covers his ($_izuku) mouth with his ($_izuku) hands . Anyway , what are your ($_katsuki) friends like ? 
"
15122435,3,103,"Oh , uh , Uraraka ($_uraraka) and Iida ($_iida) . Uraraka ($_uraraka) s a girl and she ($_uraraka) has brown hair and a round face . Iida ($_iida) wears spectacles , and he ($_iida) s smartest so he ($_iida) s probably in the lead . They 're both good with magic , so I was safe when I was around them 
"
15122435,3,104,"... Then you got lost 'cause you re useless , right ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) guesses , disinterested . Lower class problems hold no significance to him ($_iida) . 
"
15122435,3,105,"I. . . I mean , I guess . It certainly would be easier if I could do magic , but Yeah , I ca n't . Nobody really knows why . I 'm just not like the others . 
"
15122435,3,106,"That 's nice , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says distractedly , his ($_katsuki) attention deviated more focused on making sure they do n't bump into anything that is n't friendly . Well , if they did find a animal it would be good for his ($_katsuki) hunt He ($_katsuki) d have to make sure Izuku ($_izuku) stayed out of his ($_katsuki) way 
"
15122435,3,107,"It s raining . 
"
15122435,3,108,"Huh ? As the word leaves his ($_katsuki) lips Katsuki ($_katsuki) feels the lightest press against his ($_katsuki) nose , causing him ($_katsuki) to scrunch it instinctively . Then another drop hits his ($_katsuki) cheek and he ($_katsuki) reaches out to touch the spot , noting the water on his ($_katsuki) fingers , appearing red against the blood he ($_katsuki) has yet to wash off . Oh , he ($_katsuki) says , I guess it is raining . 
"
15122435,3,109,"Izuku ($_izuku) crosses his ($_izuku) arms over his ($_izuku) chest . I hope the others are doing alright How long do you ($_izuku) think it s gon na be until we find them ? he ($_katsuki) asks Katsuki ($_katsuki) . I 'm starting to get really worried 
"
15122435,3,110,"Well , we re in a bit of a predicament now , are n't we ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) responds sardonically , running a hand over his ($_katsuki) face as he ($_katsuki) considers what to do . Technically ($_technically) , it ($_technically) would be easier to wish Izuku ($_izuku) luck on his ($_katsuki) conquests and simply leave him ($_katsuki) here to find his ($_katsuki) own way , killing a small animal on his ($_katsuki) way home and explaining to his ($_katsuki) mother that it ($_technically) had been a slow day . Yeah , she ($_katsuki) d give him ($_katsuki) another shot . 
"
15122435,3,111,"Probably. 
"
15122435,3,112,"Yet Katsuki ($_katsuki) casts a sideways glance at Izuku ($_izuku) . That would n't be the morally acceptable way to go about the current scenario , would n't it ? As future king , it s his ($_katsuki) duty to guide and protect everyone . 
"
15122435,3,113,"The rain pours harder , leaving Katsuki ($_katsuki) little room to ponder over it thoroughly . His ($_katsuki) hair and clothes becoming soaked , he ($_katsuki) grabs Izuku ($_izuku) s arm and says , We can worry about your friends later . For now we need to find shelter . 
"
15122435,3,114,"A-alright , Izuku ($_izuku) relents , moving to keep up with him ($_katsuki) . Where are we going ? 
"
15122435,3,115,"Anywhere that is n't here , responds Katsuki ($_katsuki) vaguely , not relinquishing his ($_katsuki) hold on Izuku 's arm . Their feet squish against the wet ground and they break into a jog that then becomes a run , what had been a light drizzle seconds ago now a seemingly endless downpour , soaking Katsuki ($_katsuki) to the bone . He can only hope that he wo n't catch a cold due to this . 
"
15122435,3,116,"He has n't the faintest clue how long they 've been walking the interval being anywhere between five and twenty minutes , each second overshadowed by the fact that Katsuki ($_katsuki) is gradually becoming further and further from his ($_katsuki) village , fueling the ` This is somehow going to end badly for me ($_katsuki) premonition he ($_katsuki) s been keeping tucked away until Izuku ($_izuku) eventually points with his ($_katsuki) free arm towards something Katsuki ($_katsuki) ca n't see . Cave , he ($_katsuki) explains , and that 's all Katsuki ($_katsuki) needs to hear . 
"
15122435,3,117,"Inside it s cold and damp , though neither boy complains considering that it s better than waiting for the rain to stop out there . Katsuki ($_katsuki) lifts his ($_katsuki) lighted hand to better illuminate their surroundings and , despite it not giving them much to work with , Izuku ($_izuku) begins to wander further in . 
"
15122435,3,118,"Hey , wait , Katsuki ($_katsuki) whispers harshly , refusing to raise his ($_katsuki) voice , what are you doing ? Are you an idiot ? 
"
15122435,3,119,"It s too cold , complains Izuku ($_izuku) in response , his ($_izuku) voice coming from far away . 
"
15122435,3,120,"Yeah , but it ll be cold back there too ! Get over here , it s better if we stay together . Silently , Katsuki ($_katsuki) waits until Izuku ($_izuku) returns . God ($_god) , you re so frustrating . First you say you do n't know magic and then you ca n't listen to simple instructions . How are you not dead ? 
"
15122435,3,121,"I ve never really ... been on my own , Izuku ($_izuku) answers , taking a seat against the cave wall and closing his ($_izuku) eyes , assuming the feeble position knees brought to his ($_izuku) chest and arms wrapped around them , curling into a tight ball . We never meant to head this far in the forest . We should have been more careful . I 'm sorry if me getting lost was such a huge burden to you . 
"
15122435,3,122,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) presses his ($_katsuki) lips into a thin line , shining his ($_katsuki) explosion light over Izuku ($_izuku) to see him ($_katsuki) better . Izuku ($_izuku) does n't flinch , staring at the ground , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) says , It s fine , at least it added a little excitement to my ($_izuku) day anyway . I ($_izuku) was supposed to be hunting for an animal but I ($_izuku) was n't able to find one . My ($_izuku) village is going to be disappointed when I ($_izuku) return with nothing . I ($_izuku) might be as worthless as you are . 
"
15122435,3,123,"Uh thank you ? 
"
15122435,3,124,"Since it s obvious we must not live in the same village , Katsuki ($_katsuki) begins , what s it ($_katsuki) like where you live ? 
"
15122435,3,125,"It s nice . Y-you said your home rules with kings and queens , right ? Well , mine ($_izuku) is overseen by a village leader , Izuku ($_izuku) explains , tracing patterns in the dirt with his ($_izuku) shoe . That role is n't passed down through bloodline , additionally . The leader is given the task to choose his or her successor when they ve reached a point in their life when they think they 're no longer fitted to continue leading . 
"
15122435,3,126,"But what happens if the leader dies before they 're able to choose a successor ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks , genuinely intrigued . He ($_katsuki) 's never heard anything remotely like this before . 
"
15122435,3,127,"They usually have their successor chosen prior to retiring , actually , Izuku ($_izuku) says . No one knows how early in advance they choose that person , but apparently it s very hush-hush . Not even the person that s picked knows it 's them until the retirement or death , as you suggested . 
"
15122435,3,128,"Interesting. 
"
15122435,3,129,"Ha , yeah . Izuku shifts . Again , I 'm sorry if I bothered you at all . I mean , even though you were the one that put an arrow through my shoulder It was also kinda my fault for getting in your way . 
"
15122435,3,130,"Yes , I know . But it s fine , it happened . There s nothing we can do to change it now . Katsuki_,_pretending_to_find_interest_in_a_particular_rock ($_rock) , attempts to keep his ($_rock) tone casual as he ($_rock) asks , How s your wound doing ? 
"
15122435,3,131,"It s soaked 'cause of the rain , but it s fine . It does n't hurt too much . Well , compared to what it was when it happened . Katsuki ($_katsuki) can feel Izuku ($_izuku) watching him ($_katsuki) . You know , you re really amazing . It s pretty spectacular you can do magic like that , Izuku ($_izuku) says , likely referring to the miniature explosions in Katsuki ($_katsuki) s palm . I wish I could do magic . 
"
15122435,3,132,"What a stupid wish , Katsuki ($_katsuki) thinks , but does n't voice aloud . If you ca n't then you have no choice other than to accept it . It sucks , but that 's just how life works . 
"
15122435,3,133,"When I leave , Izuku ($_izuku) says after a while , lifting his ($_izuku) head and looking at the ceiling , is there a chance that I could maybe possibly come visit you again ? 
"
15122435,3,134,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) spins around to face him ($_izuku) . What did you just say ? 
"
15122435,3,135,"Oh , yeah I figured you would n't like it . 
"
15122435,3,136,"Why would you want to do that ? Like you ve kept repeating , I shot you with an arrow , Katsuki ($_katsuki) reminds him ($_izuku) . 
"
15122435,3,137,"Yes , but that was an accident and it hardly matters now . It s kinda boring being in the village all the time , and I love my friends but you 're different . You re allowed to go hunting on your own , for God ($_god) s sake ! You re everything all the kids my age dream to be . Uh , including me . 
"
15122435,3,138,"Katsuki_,_still_unsure_about_this_suggestion ($_still) , shakes his ($_still) head . That 's insane . How would you even want to meet up with me ? Where would we go ? 
"
15122435,3,139,"It seems pretty secluded here . 
"
15122435,3,140,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) opens his ($_katsuki) mouth to respond , but whatever he ($_katsuki) s about to say is cut off by an abrupt cry , startling him ($_katsuki) . 
"
15122435,3,141,"Izuku ($_izuku) ? Izuku ($_izuku) ! Are you here ? Izuku ($_izuku) ! The voice is undeniably female , coming from directly outside . Not wanting to be spotted , Katsuki ($_katsuki) takes a step closer to where Izuku ($_izuku) is sitting and practically flattens himself ($_izuku) against the wall , halting his ($_izuku) explosions . 
"
15122435,3,142,"Izuku ($_izuku) s expression brightens . Those are my friends ! That s Uraraka ($_uraraka) . Tears begin to well up in his ($_izuku) eyes . They came all this way to find me . 
"
15122435,3,143,"Then get out before they find us in here , you idiot ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps , and Izuku ($_izuku) nods . 
"
15122435,3,144,"Please tell me you ll at least think about it , Izuku ($_izuku) says , holding onto his ($_izuku) shoulder as he ($_izuku) stands . About wanting to see me again , that is . I know it sounds really sudden but maybe there s a reason why we met . 
"
15122435,3,145,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) chooses to neither confirm nor deny that final statement , instead grunting and managing , Fine . Tomorrow , when the sun is at its peak . I ll wait for about an hour or so . If you do n't show up on time I 'm leaving . 
"
15122435,3,146,"Izuku ($_izuku) smiles . Got it ($_izuku) , he replies , and leaves . At the cave entrance , he turns around and waves . I ll see you then ! 
"
15122435,3,147,"Do n't scream so loud where everyone can hear you . 
"
15122435,3,148,"Sorry , Izuku ($_izuku) whispers . I promise I wo n't tell anyone I met you , he adds as an afterthought , and disappears from view . 
"
15122435,3,149,"Outside , Katsuki ($_katsuki) can hear the female friend Uraraka , Izuku ($_izuku) said her ($_katsuki) name is cry out in relief , scolding , Izuku , I ca n't believe you wandered off on your own like that . You had us so worried ! Wait , what happened to your shoulder ? 
"
15122435,3,150,"Another voice , this one male , adds , Do you have any idea how dangerous it is when we re not in a group ? You re lucky it was only your shoulder that got injured . 
"
15122435,3,151,"Come on , Iida ($_iida) cast a searching spell . We should be able to make it back to the village with no problem . Then Recovery Girl can have a look at your injury . 
"
15122435,3,152,"How did that happen , anyway ? Iida ($_iida) asks , and Izuku ($_izuku) s answer is inaudible as they leave Katsuki ($_katsuki) s proximity . 
"
15122435,3,153,"Great . Katsuki ($_katsuki) groans , waiting a while longer before he ($_katsuki) leaves , as well . What the hell did I get myself into ? 
"
15122435,3,154,"What could they possibly mean when they say ` Leave our territory ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) demands at once , swiveling to face his ($_katsuki) mother . This is our territory , last I checked ! 
"
15122435,3,155,"It is ! Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) returns , sounding more nervous than angry . I have no idea what that could mean I do n't understand . She ($_mitsuki) lifts her ($_mitsuki) head and notices Mina , who remains standing in the doorway . Ah , yes , Ashido . Thank you for informing me about this incident . I ll speak to my husband about it further when his group returns from their investigation . 
"
15122435,3,156,"Hey , what about me ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) demands . Shouldn t I have a say in what to do about this , too ? 
"
15122435,3,157,"No , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) says , you should n't , because you 're irresponsible . You re returning to your hut immediately . Me and your father have the situation handled . She ($_mina) returns her ($_mina) attention to Mina . If you could escort him I would greatly appreciate it . Thank you . 
"
15122435,3,158,"No issue , Your Highness , Mina ($_mina) says politely , mainly ignoring that glare Katsuki gives her ($_mina) as she ($_mina) moves aside to allow him ($_mina) to exit first . She ($_mina) follows after him ($_mina) , closing the door on her ($_mina) way out . I see you re not very happy about the current proceedings , she ($_mina) adds , keeping a respectable distance behind him ($_mina) . 
"
15122435,3,159,"Of course I 'm not ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) groans , kicking at the dirt . They ($_katsuki) always treat me like a child , like it s not in my best interest to have a say in what s decided for the future . Hell , I am the future . I ll be a much better king than anyone in my family ever was . 
"
15122435,3,160,"That is quite the ambition , Mina ($_mina) comments , then remembers to tack on , my king . Besides , I do n't think it s that large a problem . Erm , well , I mean , the murder was really bad , but not the ` Leave our territory thing . The king and queen have dealt with pesky intruders in the past . For all we know this could be another mediocre magic user with too much pride , wanting to start a conflict . It s best not to get too many people involved . 
"
15122435,3,161,"Still , we ve never seen an asshole like that go so far as to kill a man , muses Katsuki ($_katsuki) , slightly perturbed at the mere prospect . What if this turns out to be serious ? Then , suddenly , another thought comes to mind , scaring him to the point he stops walking altogether and faces Mina ($_mina) . You said it was a young man s body that was found , right ? Are you sure you were n't able to make out any details ? 
"
15122435,3,162,"As I stated , his body was completely scorched . The only reason we were able to identify him as male was because we saw his , uh Mina ($_mina) presses the palms of her ($_mina) hands together . Either way , we should keep going . Best not to dawdle. 
"
15122435,3,163,"Right. Katsuki ($_katsuki) , shaking his ($_katsuki) head , shoves whatever worry he ($_katsuki) had felt a second ago aside . No , that would n't be possible . He ($_katsuki) went home right after Besides , he ($_katsuki) lives on the opposite end of the forest . There s no way he ($_katsuki) would be around to be killed like that . He ($_katsuki) runs a hand over his ($_katsuki) face . I 'm being paranoid . 
"
15122435,3,164,"I realize it s not my business , Mina ($_mina) says a moment later , but what were you and the queen talking about prior to my arrival ? You looked pretty angry , if I remember correctly . No , wait , do n't answer that , she ($_mina) bursts , and snaps her ($_mina) fingers . She ($_mina) was telling you off about how you left the village earlier today , right ? Is that it ? 
"
15122435,3,165,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) hesitates . How would she ($_mina) have ? 
"
15122435,3,166,"I have no idea what you 're talking about . 
"
15122435,3,167,"Oh , please , Mina ($_mina) counters , rolling her ($_mina) eyes . Everyone knows about it . King Katsuki , leaving his people every day for what ? A secret lover , mayhaps ? she ($_mina) teases , raising her ($_mina) brows . Katsuki ($_katsuki) scowls at her ($_mina) and she ($_mina) laughs . I m only kidding , there s no need to be defensive about it ! Plus , I think I might understand the real reason . 
"
15122435,3,168,"Yeah? And what would  that  be? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks , glad to be rid of the secret lover theory . 
"
15122435,3,169,"You need a break from the daily grind ! Mina ($_mina) says . It s understandable . It makes sense . All things considered , an important day is coming soon your eighteenth birthday . It s important to have some time to yourself before then , wander around Kage No Mori on your own and take advantage of your youth . If I was you I 'd probably do the same . So She leans closer . Did I get it right ? You ve just been walking around ? 
"
15122435,3,170,"""Yes. Katsuki ($_katsuki) lies . 
"
15122435,3,171,"Aha ! Sero ($_sero) owes me so much money , giggles Mina ($_mina) . Unless you do n't want me to tell anyone about that ? 
"
15122435,3,172,"That would be preferable . 
"
15122435,3,173,"Mina ($_mina) nods . Completely understandable , my king . We would n't want everyone to get the wrong idea about your intentions , and yet I am rather sure most people are convinced that you ve been gallivanting around , doing something illegal . Which I do find to be a ridiculous assumption ! You 're our ruler , but you also make sure to follow the rules , too . That s what we admire about you . 
"
15122435,3,174,"Thank you . 
"
15122435,3,175,"You re very welcome ! I figured the truth would help cheer you up a bit . You ve been looking down these past few months and it s upsetting . Me and the others have been wondering what was wrong , but it seems the problem you had has been resolved , meaning there s no longer an issue . 
"
15122435,3,176,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) casts her ($_katsuki) a side glance . You and the others ? 
"
15122435,3,177,"You know , me and Kirishima ($_kirishima) and Sero ($_sero) A few days ago , when you and Kirishima ($_kirishima) got back from your patrol , Kirishima ($_kirishima) had told us you were in a really bad mood and that it would be best to leave you alone . Me 'n Sero ($_sero) tried to get him to spill the beans about what happened to make you so upset , but he would n't budge . It was kinda weird , frankly , since nothing seemed to be out of place but , yet again , not my business . 
"
15122435,3,178,"It most certainly is n't your business , says Katsuki ($_katsuki) sternly . He ($_katsuki) did n't say anything about what happened ? Are you sure ? 
"
15122435,3,179,"All we got was that a trap was activated , Mina ($_mina) replies , but when you guys looked inside there was nothing there . It must ve just been faulty spellcasting on the trapper s part . 
"
15122435,3,180,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) was with me , Katsuki ($_katsuki) thinks , and saw him ($_deku) , but he ($_deku) chose to lie for my sake . Now that I look back He ($_deku) had n't even asked about who Deku ($_deku) was , just simply accepted that there was a person on our territory and that I wanted to return him ($_deku) home rather than take him ($_deku) in . Logically , though , there came the question There 's another village in the forest ? which Katsuki ($_katsuki) had to answer yes , yes there is , and it 's better to keep quiet about it but still , it was odd how well Kirishima ($_kirishima) had taken this information . 
"
15122435,3,181,"Would you look at that , Mina ($_mina) says , stopping , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) follows suit . We re here . Sure enough , there is Katsuki ($_katsuki) s hut , clear as day , large and regal as it 's always been . 
"
15122435,3,182,"Yet...
"
15122435,3,183,"Katsuki , after pondering for a moment , says , I want you to keep watch , make sure no one goes inside . If they ask about what I m doing , tell them I 'm asleep . 
"
15122435,3,184,"Mina ($_mina) blinks . I , uh , yes , my king but why ? 
"
15122435,3,185,"That s none of your damn business . Just do what you 're told . Not waiting for her ($_mina) to agree , Katsuki ($_katsuki) steps around and behind his ($_katsuki) hut so he ($_katsuki) is n't spotted in the village centre . 
"
15122435,3,186,"He ($_katsuki) can hear Mina ($_mina) calling out to him ($_katsuki) as he ($_katsuki) enters the forest for the second time that night , her ($_mina) hands clasped around her ($_mina) mouth . You 're making a mistake ! 
"
15122435,3,187,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) ignores her ($_mina) , more so focused on getting to where he ($_katsuki) needs to be . It is n't a long walk at all , and in the blink of eye he ($_katsuki) s arrived at the dragon s nest . 
"
15122435,3,188,"It s a small field not far from the village that , from a distance , looks abandoned , the houses here old and rundown , covered in moss and mold for not being cleaned in so long , a place one would prefer to avoid but , upon closer inspection , hosts a small group of dragonfolk that take their human forms to sleep in the huts at night and take to their dragon forms to stretch their wings and travel during the_day ($_the) . 
"
15122435,3,189,"Being that it s evening currently 
"
15122435,3,190,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) presses two fingers to his ($_katsuki) lips and whistles , the sound echoing before he ($_katsuki) hears several loud , displeased groans , that which he ($_katsuki) disregards and taps his ($_katsuki) foot impatiently , having made his ($_katsuki) demand very clear . 
"
15122435,3,191,"He ($_katsuki) s about ready to give up and return home when he ($_katsuki) feels a hand on his ($_katsuki) arm and he ($_katsuki) spins around , already on the alert . Then , when he ($_katsuki) sees it 's just Kirishima ($_kirishima) in human form , glowers at him ($_katsuki) and hisses , You ($_katsuki) idiot ! What the hell do you ($_katsuki) think you ($_katsuki) 're doing ? 
"
15122435,3,192,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) laughs , holding up his ($_kirishima) hands in mock surrender . Hey , you ($_katsuki) were the one that came here . What s wrong ? Did something happen ? he ($_katsuki) asks , becoming gravely serious . 
"
15122435,3,193,"Well , a dead body was found outside the village today , Katsuki ($_katsuki) begins , overly casual about the topic . We have no idea who it ($_katsuki) is that was killed , but they do n't seem to be one of our people but that s not what I wanted to talk about . He ($_katsuki) narrows his ($_katsuki) eyes . How much have you ($_katsuki) been saying about what occurred during our hunt the_other_day ($_the) ? 
"
15122435,3,194,"Oh , that Yeah . I figured you ($_katsuki) would n't be too happy about it , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , running a hair through his hair awkwardly . Listen , I know about as much about that entire interaction as everyone else does that is to say , not a lot . There s still a whole lot that does n't make sense and I do n't get it , but That boy we helped what did you ($_katsuki) call him ? Deku ($_deku) ? lives in another village . In Kage No Mori . To be honest , I knew about it before you ($_katsuki) told me . It s hard to miss when you ($_katsuki) spend most of your ($_katsuki) time flying around . 
"
15122435,3,195,"Katsuki ($_katsuki) clicks his ($_katsuki) tongue . It definitely explains why Kirishima ($_kirishima) had taken the news as well as he ($_katsuki) had . I ve known since I was a kid . I figured it had to have been a secret , but I do n't really understand why . I do n't even know if my parents know about it .

15122435,3,196,"Kirishima ($_kirishima) exhales deeply , sounding utterly exhausted . It ($_kirishima) s an old story , apparently . I ve heard many varying versions of it ($_kirishima) , and I 'm not sure which is true . Regardless , the separation exists for a reason and maybe that reason is n't our concern , but it s best not to mess with it . That Deku kid we helped

He s useless . He ca n't even control his magic . He would ve hurt himself if we left him in that trap . As in , more hurt than he was when we arrived .

15122435,3,200,"What do you ($_katsuki) mean ?

15122435,3,203,"He ca n't control his magic . Whenever he uses it , even if it 's just a simple spell , it breaks his body .

"
15122435,3,208,"Well , more of a half-truth . Technically he ($_katsuki) had , but that threat comes off as a moot point pending the continuation of their sexual interactions . 
"
15122435,3,209,"And Katsuki ($_katsuki) is n't stopping . Not again.
