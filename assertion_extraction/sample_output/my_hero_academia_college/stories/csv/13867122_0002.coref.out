13867122,2,1,"After discovering that room I ($_i) took as many scrolls as I ($_i) could carry , any food I ($_i) could carry , fed my ($_i) horse and then rode to north . 
"
13867122,2,2,"It was strange , living on the road for months but I ($_i) had no choice if I ($_i) wanted to get my ($_i) revenge on Tomura Shigaraki . So I ($_i) did what I ($_i) had to , eat when I ($_i) could and did small jobs to earn food or money for my ($_i) travels in different towns . 
"
13867122,2,3,"Every time I ($_i) had time to rest , I ($_i) d use it to read about the legend of the dragon riders . 
"
13867122,2,4,"The scrolls were old but despite their age , in a really good shape . From what I ($_i) had gathered so far , I ($_i) could tell that the dragon riders were a strong and prideful folk . With their help , my ($_i) ancestor conquered and built his kingdom . I ($_i) still wasn t sure what the fire in the painting had meant but I ($_i) decided it most likely was just a metaphor for sharing power or something . 
"
13867122,2,5,"Some of the old tales were written in letters , some were painted . It was hard to interpret but not impossible . 
"
13867122,2,6,"There was a part which was missing so I ($_i) wasn t sure why but for some reason dragon riders all disappeared . My ($_i) ancestor gave them something in return for their service and then they were never seen again . 
"
13867122,2,7,"From what I ($_i) could translate , it seemed like the dragon riders hid from humankind in the strange land hidden behind the northern mountains . 
"
13867122,2,8,"I ($_i) had a plan , no matter how crazy it sounded . Honestly , I ($_i) had nothing to lose at this point . I ($_i) was planning to find these dragon riders , ask them to help my ($_i) family once again . Ask them to stop the darkness that was looming over our world . 
"
13867122,2,9,"I ($_i) mean , obviously the man , Tomura , was trying to find this information too . Why else come to my ($_i) home and destroy everything , this information was important . It had to be ! I ($_i) refused to believe that my ($_i) family died for nothing . 
"
13867122,2,10,"The only thing that made sense was that the dragon riders were real or at least the villain believed them to be . 
"
13867122,2,11,"The horse I ($_i) stole came to snuffle my ($_i) hair , we had become pretty close with each other . I ($_i) named him Damian , ironically the same name that one of my ($_i) brother s had . Damian Todoroki , funny right ? But my ($_i) mother was a foreigner , that s where the name came from . 
"
13867122,2,12,"Damian ($_damian) was the quiet little brother who enjoyed reading old languages with me ($_i) , the horse counterpart seemed to enjoy hearing me ($_i) read as well . 
"
13867122,2,13,"I ($_i) noticed was that the paintings were actually done by my ($_i) ancestor . I ($_i) saw his signature in every artwork . Sadly I ($_i) could not tell much from them except that they always had the same woman in them . A woman sitting by the rocks watching skies , standing in the water with her_dragon ($_the) . There were also some close portraits about her smiling , my ($_i) ancestor really seemed fond of her . 
"
13867122,2,14,"Her eyes were red like the_dragon_she_rode ($_the) . She seemed powerful too , maybe someone my ($_i) ancestor was in love with ? 
"
13867122,2,15,"I ($_i) huffed , she did look beautiful in a strange , foreign way . 
"
13867122,2,16,"Damian ($_damian) nickers , making me ($_i) feel self conscious . 
"
13867122,2,17,"Shut it . I ($_i) murmured face heating up and put the scroll down to throw more wood to the fire . Damian ($_damian) just smelled my ($_i) clothes and I ($_i) knew what he ($_damian) wanted . I ($_i) pulled out a small pouch with treats in it and gave some to him ($_damian) . He ($_damian) gently ate from my ($_i) hands , careful not to bite . 
"
13867122,2,18,"The fire danced on the campfire , creating shadows with it s light . I ($_i) stared at it in silence before yawning . I ($_i) felt tired , not much surprise there considering I ($_i) slept as little as I ($_i) could . Because whenever I ($_i) closed my ($_i) eyes , I ($_i) saw the rotting bodies in the ruins of my ($_i) home . 
"
13867122,2,19,"Damian ($_damian) poked me ($_i) with his ($_damian) muzzle , I ($_i) smiled at him ($_damian) . 
"
13867122,2,20,"I m fine Damian , no need to worry . It was strange , talking to a horse . Yet at the same time this horse was the only one I ($_i) could trust . There was no one else anymore . 
"
13867122,2,21,"Do you ($_i) think I ($_i) m crazy ? I ($_i) asked , Damian ($_damian) turned to look at me ($_i) with his ($_damian) usual curious eyes . Riding all the way to the north , I m lucky it s not winter . 
"
13867122,2,22,"Damian ($_damian) shook his ($_damian) head before going down to lay next to me ($_i) . I ($_i) smiled at him ($_damian) as I ($_i) pet his ($_damian) head . 
"
13867122,2,23,"I ($_i) turned to look at the scrolls again , it was much more interesting to me ($_i) than sleeping . 
"
13867122,2,24,"I ($_i) was fascinated with the female dragon rider who my ($_i) ancestor kept repeating in his stories . It was rather disappointing I ($_i) couldn t understand what her name was or how it was pronounced . I ($_i) noticed a tattoo on her shoulder and I ($_i) recognised it as the same symbol as the one that had been in the secret room s passage . My ($_i) father used to say this mark symbolises strength and that it was important for me ($_i) to remember . Never did he tell me ($_i) the reason for it . 
"
13867122,2,25,"You ($_i) re powerful then ? Or your ($_i) clan is ? I ($_i) wondered out loud as I ($_i) stared at her images . It was frustrating to say the least . At the end of the day all I ($_i) had was this symbol , knowledge that they reside in the north and that the hide behind the mountains . 
"
13867122,2,26,"Why are the hiding ? If they re so powerful and have dragons , hiding seemed really foolish for me ($_i) . Why weren t they joining the world ? 
"
13867122,2,27,"I ($_i) felt my ($_i) eyelids get heavier and my ($_i) vision got blurry . I ($_i) tried to fight the sleep like I ($_i) do every night but in the end , like every other night , I ($_i) fell asleep . 
"
13867122,2,28,"Shoto ! Take your siblings 
"
13867122,2,29,"Let them go ! 
"
13867122,2,30,"Nomu 
"
13867122,2,31,"I ($_i) gasp loudly as I ($_i) sit up to escape my ($_i) nightmare . I ($_i) take deep breaths to calm myself ($_i) before rubbing my ($_i) face . I m fine , it s fine . I m alive 
"
13867122,2,32,"I ($_i) exhale as my ($_i) breathing calms down , I ($_i) notice that the sun isn t yet up but it s definitely early morning . The fire had gone out leaving only a small , smoking pile . Damian ($_damian) seems to have woken up from my ($_i) panicking , I ($_i) calmly apologize and he ($_damian) puts his ($_damian) head back down . 
"
13867122,2,33,"I haven t even needed to tie him ($_damian) up to make sure he ($_damian) won t abandon me ($_i) , Damian ($_damian) seems to be very fond of me ($_i) as well . 
"
13867122,2,34,"I ($_i) look down , the voices never leave me ($_i) . I ($_i) can t sleep without being followed by them , not until I ($_i) get my ($_i) revenge . 
"
13867122,2,35,"I ($_i) bite my ($_i) lip and hug myself ($_i) , I ($_i) need to get a grip . Being this way isn t helpful at all , I ($_i) need to have faith that these scrolls mean something . 
"
13867122,2,36,"My ($_i) stomach crumbles and I ($_i) pull my ($_i) bag that s nearby , it s running empty . There s only one bread left and I ($_i) sigh in frustration . I ($_i) will need to visit another town again , luckily I ($_i) still have money left from my ($_i) last job . 
"
13867122,2,37,"Seems like we re going to have to make another stop Damian . I ($_i) say as I ($_i) stand up . Damian ($_damian) lifts his ($_damian) head before stumbling up and walking to me ($_i) as I ($_i) pack things . 
"
13867122,2,38,"I ($_i) kick rest of the campfire so it s out completely . This way there s no risk of a forest fire . I ($_i) jump to Damian ($_damian) s back , riding him ($_damian) has gotten much smoother after I ($_i) got the saddle . 
"
13867122,2,39,"I ($_i) press against Damian ($_damian) s sides gently to signal him ($_damian) to move forward . The nearest town wasn t too far away but it would take a while to get there . 
"
13867122,2,40,"I ($_i) take a bite from the bread on my ($_i) hand as we ride towards our destination . 
"
13867122,2,41,"I ($_i) hadn t taken into account how early on the move I ($_i) was . The sun hadn t even risen when we arrived . I sigh as I ($_i) drop down and proceed to walk Damian ($_damian) to where horses are supposed to be left when entering the bar that was literally the only place open . 
"
13867122,2,42,"Sorry Damian ($_damian) . I ($_i) say as he neighs to me ($_i) , annoyed for being tied to the nearby post . They don t like horses being freely here . I ($_i) ll just buy something and come back . 
"
13867122,2,43,"I ($_i) could swear that Damian ($_damian) was frowning , not that I ($_i) could confirm how horses frowned . 
"
13867122,2,44,"When I ($_i) entered the bar it was surprisingly crowded . I ($_i) walk to the counter and this only slightly older man turns to me ($_i) . The bar probably belongs to the father or then he s very young bar owner . 
"
13867122,2,45,"Hello , I ($_i) d like to buy some food and water from my ($_i) travels . I ($_i) say politely , he looks at me ($_i) and arches a brow . 
"
13867122,2,46,"Only water , you come to the bar to buy water ? He says , sounding slightly amused . 
"
13867122,2,47,"This is the only place open . I ($_i) say , he huffs but nods . I ($_i) sit to wait as he goes get some water and food for me ($_i) . 
"
13867122,2,48,"I ($_i) sigh and look around , everyone seems to be mostly minding their own business . 
"
13867122,2,49,"A_boy ($_deku) sits next to me ($_i) , around the same age as I ($_i) am . I ($_i) notice his ($_deku) unusual hair color , it s dark green . 
"
13867122,2,50,"Hey Gabriel ! The usual please. The boy shouts and I ($_i) hear the man from earlier to shout back to him ($_deku) . 
"
13867122,2,51,"The_boy ($_deku) chuckles and then turns to smile at me ($_i) . 
"
13867122,2,52,"You don t look like a local . He ($_deku) says , breaking the silence between us . 
"
13867122,2,53,"I ($_i) realize he ($_deku) s noticed I ($_i) ve been staring so I ($_i) turn to look away . 
"
13867122,2,54,"Yes , I m not from around here . I ($_i) say and turn to him ($_deku) again . He ($_deku) smiles at me ($_i) and nods . 
"
13867122,2,55,"I ($_i) thought as much , you have southern clothing . I ($_i) m called Deku ($_deku) , it s a nickname that I m quite fond of . Deku ($_deku) says to me ($_i) . I ($_i) have no idea why would he ($_deku) like to be called by his ($_deku) nickname by a total stranger but I ($_i) lift my ($_i) hand to shake his ($_deku) . 
"
13867122,2,56,"I m Shoto ($_shoto) . I ($_i) say , careful not to reveal my ($_i) surname . He ($_deku) doesn t seem to mind as he ($_deku) shakes my ($_i) hand as well . 
"
13867122,2,57,"Then I ($_i) see it , a small necklace around his ($_deku) neck . It usually wouldn t stick in my ($_i) mind but I ($_i) recognised the symbol on it . Strength , just like on that girl s shoulder and under my ($_i) home . 
"
13867122,2,58,"That necklace , where did you ($_i) get it ? I ($_i) ask , the_boy ($_deku) seems to flinch . 
"
13867122,2,59,"Ah this , it s a gift . He says nervously . It s just a small thing , nothing too impressive but I ($_i) like it . 
"
13867122,2,60,"He was not telling me everything . This necklace , this person was my only solid clue in months ! 
"
13867122,2,61,"It looks beautiful . I finally say after realizing how uncomfortable_Deku ($_deku) seemed to become . I can t scare him away , not now . Deku ($_deku) smiles to me awkwardly , he then stands up when Gabriel ($_gabriel) returns . 
"
13867122,2,62,"Here you go Deku ($_deku) . He says and gives Deku ($_deku) this big bag . 
"
13867122,2,63,"Thanks , it was nice talking with you Shoto ($_shoto) . Deku ($_deku) says and pays Gabriel ($_gabriel) before leaving . 
"
13867122,2,64,"So we got bread or meat , which one would you want ? Gabriel ($_gabriel) asks me as I suddenly stood up . 
"
13867122,2,65,"Sorry , I ll come back later . Something came up ! I say and quickly leave the bar . Gabriel ($_gabriel) shouts something after me but I have no time to stay and listen . 
"
13867122,2,66,"I see Deku ($_deku) getting up on a horse and he ($_deku) notices me and I can swear I saw him ($_deku) curse under his ($_deku) breath . 
"
13867122,2,67,"Deku ($_deku) quickly signals his ($_deku) horse to start running . He ($_deku) definitely wants to hide something and it must have something to do with that necklace , he ($_deku) became scared the moment I mentioned it . 
"
13867122,2,68,"I ran to Damian and quickly freed him ($_deku) before getting up on his ($_deku) back . 
"
13867122,2,69,"Damian ($_damian) is a strong horse and because of that he ($_damian) s also very fast . It didn t take me long to see Deku ($_deku) again , he ($_damian) was riding in to the forest . I can t lose him ($_damian) so I urge Damian ($_damian) to ride faster . Deku ($_deku) turns to look back but I m riding off road , mixed within the trees . 
"
13867122,2,70,"Damian ($_damian) is able to keep up with Deku ($_deku) easily , he ($_damian) s used to running in uneven ground . 
"
13867122,2,71,"I see Deku ($_deku) stop riding and I slow down as well . He ($_damian) stopped on a cliff , I try to see better what he ($_damian) s doing but don t dare to bring Damian ($_damian) too close . 
"
13867122,2,72,"There is a huge waterfall in front of the cliff , I can t understand why Deku ($_deku) would stop there . 
"
13867122,2,73,"Deku ($_deku) takes his ($_deku) necklace and lifts it up in the air . Suddenly the water splits apart , showing a path inside the waterfall that goes right through the mountain . 
"
13867122,2,74,"I feel shocked as Deku ($_deku) begins to ride past it . I realize I can t waste time so I gently kick Damian ($_damian) to make him ($_damian) run . 
"
13867122,2,75,"Waterfall starts to return to normal right before I reach it so I signal Damian ($_damian) to jump in . 
"
13867122,2,76,"Right before it closes , Damian ($_damian) reaches the other side and water hits him ($_damian) in the tail . Damian ($_damian) seems slightly distressed so I hush him ($_damian) to calm him ($_damian) down . 
"
13867122,2,77,"I lifted my eyes to see where Deku ($_deku) went but don t see him ($_damian) anywhere . I hope I didn t lose him ($_damian) already . 
"
13867122,2,78,"After getting out of the cave , I gasp when I see snow on the other side . Snow everywhere but it s not cold , it s strange but it s. . . warm snow . 
"
13867122,2,79,"We walk slowly with Damian ($_damian) , then I notice Deku ($_deku) climbing up the mountain road with his ($_deku) horse . 
"
13867122,2,80,"I urge Damian ($_damian) to run again so that we d catch up with him ($_deku) . Deku ($_deku) notices me and his ($_deku) expression turns shocked . 
"
13867122,2,81,"Wait! Don t come - ! Deku ($_deku) shouts out and I ($_deku) look up to him ($_deku) . Then Damian ($_damian) lets out a loud whine when the ice under us breaks . Deku ($_deku) looks like he ($_deku) turns the horse around to get to us but it s too late . Shoto ($_shoto) ! 
"
13867122,2,82,"Damian ($_damian) looks horrified when we fall to the running water . I try to get to him ($_deku) to save him ($_deku) , but Damian ($_damian) accidentally kicks me in the head while trying to swim to safety . 
"
13867122,2,83,"I felt light headed and I sink underwater , I remember cursing in my mind that this seemed to become a habit . 
"
13867122,2,84,"I try to get back to the surface before I run out of air but the water froze already . It shouldn t , not that fast ! I hit against the ice , I get pulled back to the bottom by the current . 
"
13867122,2,85,"I hope Damian ($_damian) got to the shore . 
"
13867122,2,86,"Suddenly the ice breaks as someone jumps into the water with me . I see flash of blonde hair before my vision blurs and I lose consciousness . 
"
13867122,2,87,"Next part is a little fuzzy to me , I recall waking up for a moment . I felt strangely warm , but I can t remember that well . I look up to see color red , everywhere . I groan and then fade out again . 
"
13867122,2,88,"Shoto ($_shoto) . 
"
13867122,2,89,"Shoto ($_shoto) you need to take your siblings 
"
13867122,2,90,"Shoto ($_shoto) . 
"
13867122,2,91,"SHOTO ($_shoto) ! 
"
13867122,2,92,"I shout out and sit up , body covered in sweat . No , it isn t sweat ... I m completely wet . 
"
13867122,2,93,"I blink few times before I realize bunch of unfamiliar faces surrounding me . 
"
13867122,2,94,"Who is he ? An older man asks from others . 
"
13867122,2,95,"We don t know , he followed Deku ($_deku) here . A tall woman next to him answers . 
"
13867122,2,96,"Not only do I notice that there isn t any snow anymore , I also realized something of the people around me . 
"
13867122,2,97,"they re all wearing strange clothing but that s not what catches my eye . It s their necklaces , all of them are wearing the same symbol . 
"
13867122,2,98,"You re the dragon riders I gasp , they look at me with confused looks . 
"
13867122,2,99,"What do you think he knows ? The woman speaks again . I bite down angrily and get up , my legs feel little shaken up from what just happened . 
"
13867122,2,100,"You are them aren t you !? I ask , they turn to me and look little alarmed . 
"
13867122,2,101,"What do you know of us ? The older man speaks . I swallow down my nervousness . 
"
13867122,2,102,"My name is Shoto , I ve been looking for you for months ! I say , they don t look any less reserved . 
"
13867122,2,103,"The older man whispers something to the woman next to him and I feel little worried they don t trust me . Not that I can blame them , they seem little closed off and I m the outsider . 
"
13867122,2,104,"I have something important to tell your king , it s urgent ! I explained but it doesn t seem like they care . 
"
13867122,2,105,"Please! I speak out again , they just stare at me and I can feel the frustration rise from my chest . I need to speak with your king ! Please bring me to him ! 
"
13867122,2,106,"I step forward and they quickly pull out their swords but I refuse to be intimidated . I mean it , it s truly important ! I swear I mean no harm ! 
"
13867122,2,107,"They don t lower their swords . 
"
13867122,2,108,"Stay back ! The woman shouts and I get even more angry than I was before . 
"
13867122,2,109,"I said I don t mean no harm ! Just let me meet with your king ! I came all this way to meet with him ! I shout , stepping forward and they almost attack me . I flinch when they stop and turn to look up . 
"
13867122,2,110,"I hear strange flapping sound and notice the large shadow hiding the sun . I lift my head and my eyes widen in surprise , there s a large dragon circling us . 
"
13867122,2,111,"The people I had fought with just moments before kneeled down . I was still trying to progress the huge animal who dropped down escorted with the strong wind . The shock wave almost gets me off my feet but I manage to stay up . 
"
13867122,2,112,"Who seeks the king !? A woman s voice shouts and I realize there is a woman riding the dragon . She drops down and now I see her properly , shock fills my expression . 
"
13867122,2,113,"Her body is well toned , she looks wild and powerful . Her short hair blonde and spikey , eyes sharp red . Around her shoulders is a big red cape with fur around the neck . Her clothing is unusual but it suits her wild outlook . Shorts showing her thighs and short tube top showing off her midriff . 
"
13867122,2,114,"Words escape my mind when she walks over to me . She puts her hand on her hip and I can see that her teeth are slightly sharp when she grins curiosity showing in her eyes . The people are still bowing and something in me wants to bow too , this woman was influential . Important and then it hits me . That tattoo on her shoulder . I know this woman . 
"
13867122,2,115,"I know her because I ve watched her face every night and day . 
"
13867122,2,116,"I know her because my ancestor painted her over and over . 
"
13867122,2,117,"I know she shouldn t be alive . 
"
13867122,2,118,"I know she s more gorgeous in real life . 
"
13867122,2,119,"Then she speaks loud and clear . 
"
13867122,2,120,"I am the Queen !
