13794855,3,1,"The_last_customer_of_the_day ($_'s) drops his ($_'s) payment on the counter , the coins clinking against each other . With his ($_'s) other hand , he ($_'s) picks up the brown paper bag containing his ($_'s) purchase of various nuts and bolts . `` Between you and Bakugou Katsuki last week , '' he ($_'s) says conversationally . `` You two really stole the show . '' 
"
13794855,3,2,"`` Ah , Kacchan_'s ($_'s) fireworks display was something else , was n't it ? '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiles . No matter how many of his ($_midoriya) customers bring up the events of the festival night , he ($_midoriya) ca n't help but blush a little . 
"
13794855,3,3,"`` Sure was ! '' The_customer ($_'s) turns to go . `` But your platform was pretty impressive too . There 's no need to be so modest . '' He ($_midoriya) winks and the bell rings as he ($_midoriya) leaves the shop , an all-too-familiar chime . 
"
13794855,3,4,"It 'll be the last time Todoroki ($_todoroki) hears that sound in a long while . 
"
13794855,3,5,"Of course , neither he ($_midoriya) nor the friendly tinker knows about their predicament yet . They chat easily as Midoriya ($_midoriya) collects the payment and locks the cash register . The mechanical cuckoo pops its head out . `` 6:02 in the evening , '' it chirps . 
"
13794855,3,6,"`` Right then , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) leaves the counter , keys in hand . `` I 'll be locking the back doors . '' They 're left unlocked during the day to make receiving wares easier , since they typically arrive in large crates . At any rate , the residents of Rosa are typically law-abiding folk , and only use back doors in emergencies . On normal days there 's no worries at all . 
"
13794855,3,7,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) watches as Midoriya ($_midoriya) disappears into the space behind the shop . It ($_todoroki) 's a mix of workshop and storeroom , where Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) tools have learnt how to coexist peacefully with the towering crates of stock for the shop . It 's organized , the shop owner insists to anyone and everyone that comments on the clutter . There 's a system here . And so it stays a controlled chaos , the pattern a mystery to everyone but the person responsible for it . 
"
13794855,3,8,"The bronze feather presses against the dome and Todoroki ($_todoroki) taps the glass , returning the friendly gesture . It ruffles itself and settles down , satisfied . They get along pretty well , all things considered . 
"
13794855,3,9,"`` Oh , what do we have here ? '' A harsh voice drawls gratingly out of sight . Startled , Todoroki ($_todoroki) turns to see Midoriya ($_midoriya) backing into the shop , a stranger holding him ($_midoriya) at gunpoint . `` Nice place you ($_midoriya) got . '' A second figure strolls in after him ($_midoriya) , eyes sweeping lazily over the shelves . 
"
13794855,3,10,"Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) heart freezes as he ($_midoriya) recognizes the garb of the intruders - rogues . The pieces of black cloth tied around their wrists mark them as members of the most notorious syndicate of them all - the Coal Dragons . The origin of the name is something of an unclear issue . Some say they chose the name themselves ; others are of the opinion that the public gave them the name , due to their way of working . 
"
13794855,3,11,"Burning . Arson . Explosives . 
"
13794855,3,12,"In short , fire . 
"
13794855,3,13,"At any rate , Todoroki ($_todoroki) can never forget the name even if he wants too . 
"
13794855,3,14,"His brothers ' shouts as they took up positions on either side of the main entrance , set on protecting their family . The sneers on the rogues ' faces as they tried to force their way in . The shrieks of the women , even as his mother ordered them to escape . The flash of black cloth . 
"
13794855,3,15,"What are they doing here ? The syndicate typically leaves the smaller towns alone , not bothering their simple but carefully-maintained lives . Vicious , vile people like them thrive in the Capital . 
"
13794855,3,16,"The man with the gun shoves Midoriya ($_midoriya) behind the counter roughly . Midoriya ($_midoriya) crashes against the shelves with enough force to knock Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) dome from its ($_todoroki) place . The world spins before hitting the floor , the impact still jarring enough to daze Todoroki ($_todoroki) . The globe lies on its side on the stone . 
"
13794855,3,17,"`` Todoroki_..._''_Midoriya ($_'') calls out weakly . Todoroki ($_todoroki) looks up into bright green eyes , fearful at what he ($_'') can lose so easily . Midoriya ($_midoriya) is crumpled against the shelves , bits and pieces lying broken around him ($_'') . With a start Todoroki ($_todoroki) realizes that Midoriya ($_midoriya) knocked him ($_'') from the shelf on purpose , to hide him ($_'') from sight behind the counter . 
"
13794855,3,18,"The rogue gives Midoriya ($_midoriya) a violent kick and sends him sprawling . `` Midoriya ($_midoriya) ! '' Despite his panic , Todoroki ($_todoroki) remembers to maintain the illusion in the dome . He wishes he does n't have to . 
"
13794855,3,19,"`` I do n't have to tell you what 'll happen if you so much as think about yelling for help . After all , you 're not the type to get your friends into trouble , are you ? '' Crouching over him now , the man grabs Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) collar and punches him across the face , hard . Midoriya ($_midoriya) crumples , hanging heavily from the man 's grip on his collar . There 's blood on his face , now . 
"
13794855,3,20,"`` That should do it . '' The rogue grins and throws him onto the ground . Midoriya ($_midoriya) groans softly , barely audible , not wanting to give them the satisfaction . 
"
13794855,3,21,"That should do - do what ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) wants to yell . Why are you doing this ? There is literally no reason , no reason at all , for them to be here . 
"
13794855,3,22,"Of the attack - raid - on his house -LRB- or was it his town ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) can not remember -RRB- , there was only one escapee he 's sure of . Himself . His breath catches as a sickening , unwanted thought invades his mind . 
"
13794855,3,23,"`` Take whatever you want , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) manages . `` Just - Just leave u - me - alone . '' The barely bit back ` us ' tears at Todoroki ($_todoroki) , especially when he knows the syndicate would n't make such a low-key attack for mere robbery . No , they 're after something else . 
"
13794855,3,24,"Are they after me ? 
"
13794855,3,25,"He can not see the men prowling around the shop , but he can hear them . `` These shelves are wooden , '' one notes with glee . `` They will burn nicely . '' 
"
13794855,3,26,"Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) heart plummets . 
"
13794855,3,27,"Cans of petroleum are dragged , scraping , into the space , along with a bulky-looking sack . They must 've been waiting in the alley . Midoriya ($_midoriya) blanches and tries to stand up . He ($_midoriya) manages it , but only just . `` Please ... '' He ($_midoriya) has to lean against the shelf , gripping it so desperately his ($_midoriya) knuckles turn the colour of freshly-fallen snow . `` Stop this , whatever it is ... '' 
"
13794855,3,28,"`` No can do , buddy . '' The man with the gun hits Midoriya ($_midoriya) across the face with it , smirking . `` Why do n't you just stay down quietly ? '' 
"
13794855,3,29,"And Midoriya ($_midoriya) does just that , unable to get up from his ($_midoriya) shop floor one more time . It is n't by choice - Todoroki ($_todoroki) knows that given half the chance , he ($_midoriya) 'd stand up and fight his ($_midoriya) damnedest . 
"
13794855,3,30,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) presses his ($_midoriya) hands to the glass as the tinker glances at him ($_midoriya) . `` Do n't give yourself away , '' Midoriya ($_midoriya) whispers , voice firm . The determination in his ($_midoriya) eyes is there , even when they hear the sound of liquid sloshing around . Todoroki ($_todoroki) is unable to smell the sharp tang of fuel in the air , but he ($_midoriya) knows what it ($_todoroki) promises . He ($_midoriya) hates himself ($_midoriya) for being unable to do anything , for being helpless at a time like this . 
"
13794855,3,31,"`` Stay alive . We 'll be fine . '' 
"
13794855,3,32,"Stay alive , Shouto . We 'll meet again , okay ? 
"
13794855,3,33,"Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) had tears in her ($_fuyumi) eyes when she ($_fuyumi) said that , so long ago . Like she ($_fuyumi) was clinging to a hope , or the possible existence of one . He ($_midoriya) regrets being unable to hold her ($_fuyumi) hand , even so far back then . She ($_fuyumi) gave him ($_midoriya) a fleeting smile even as cold air swirled around her ($_fuyumi) , ready to create a diversion so her ($_fuyumi) little brother could escape the rogues . 
"
13794855,3,34,"The rogues from the very same syndicate now setting fire to Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) shop . 
"
13794855,3,35,"The feather trembles at the gradual rumbling of igniting petroleum , but has the sense to stay immobile . A choked '' Why ? '' escapes Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) lips , and Todoroki ($_todoroki) thinks it a miniscule mercy he ($_midoriya) can not see what is happening out there , to the place he ($_midoriya) 's grown so fond of . 
"
13794855,3,36,"A quiet voice floats over the counter . `` It is you the leader wants , Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) , '' the other laid-back rogue states . `` He ($_midoriya) requires ... your services . '' 
"
13794855,3,37,"They 're not here for you , says the cruel voice of hope . They 're not here for you , says the gentle voice of despair . 
"
13794855,3,38,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) does n't register relief at all . 
"
13794855,3,39,"`` People will notice I 'm gone , '' Midoriya protests weakly , even when he ($_midoriya) 's dragged out from behind the counter , the strength of the rogue not allowing any resistance . 
"
13794855,3,40,"`` We got that covered , do n't worry . '' 
"
13794855,3,41,"His ($_midoriya) fingers brush against Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) glass . Then he ($_midoriya) is gone , disappearing into the back room , into the alley , and the young night beyond . Bound , gagged , stashed somewhere , to be transported somewhere he ($_midoriya) has no wish to be . 
"
13794855,3,42,"`` What 's this ? '' Having returned , the rogue notices Todoroki ($_todoroki) on the floor . For the second time , Todoroki ($_todoroki) remembers to maintain the illusion in the dome . For the second time , he ($_midoriya) wishes he ($_midoriya) does n't have to . 
"
13794855,3,43,"The rogue kicks the globe hard , sending Todoroki ($_todoroki) against the shop wall , and - oh , heavens - everything is so loud and bright , does fire make that much noise ? The globe rolls to a stop and Todoroki ($_todoroki) finds himself with a front-row seat to the shop burning . So much for that one tiny mercy , which has abandoned him with just a careless action from the stranger . 
"
13794855,3,44,"The wooden shelves are barely recognizable now , blurs of oranges and yellows blooming everywhere in the space . The flames lick at whatever they can get their hungry maws around , devouring Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) home panel by panel . The bell is missing from its place above the door . The wood crackles , pained groans at this ruthless treatment . And who can blame them ? 
"
13794855,3,45,"In the middle of all this the quieter , but by no means less dangerous rogue crouches , opening the coarse sack . He pulls out a black mass and it takes Todoroki ($_todoroki) several mind-numbing moments to process what he 's seeing . He understands now why they 're not worried about anyone investigating Midoriya_'s ($_midoriya) disappearance . 
"
13794855,3,46,"The bastards have brought a corpse with them . 
"
13794855,3,47,"`` The leader 's really amazing , is n't he ? Coming up with a thing like this . '' The rogue with the gun muses . `` Mind-blowing , what a little magic can do . Create a bloody corpse out of animal parts . '' 
"
13794855,3,48,"`` Convincing , hm ? '' The other stands , slinging the now empty sack over his shoulder . He kicks the charred body at his feet , and Todoroki ($_todoroki) has to keep from gagging as the flesh gives . He can only pray the ... thing on the ground burns into ashes before anyone else can see it . `` Now let 's go - I reckon our work here is done . '' 
"
13794855,3,49,"They leave . 
"
13794855,3,50,"The whole place is engulfed in flames . Todoroki ($_todoroki) watches in terrible , horrified awe at the conflagration . The flames are burning in morbid stubbornness , breathtaking flowers of the inferno despite the pain threatening to collapse_Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) heart . 
"
13794855,3,51,"But then again , fire has always been beautiful . 
"
13794855,3,52,"Amid the noise of the burning taking apart his home , Todoroki_,_strangely_enough ($_todoroki) , hears nothing . Everything sounds miles away , submerged in an ocean of water . He falls to his knees when the clock crashes down from the wall into a miserable-looking heap of scrap metal on the floor , the mechanical cuckoo inside wailing . Even then , the cries are barely audible amidst the roaring of the fire . 
"
13794855,3,53,"`` You should go , too . '' The feather zips around his globe in panicked motions . Todoroki ($_todoroki) almost does n't recognise his own voice . When it ($_todoroki) hesitates , he finds that he can not muster up enough strength to demand it ($_todoroki) save itself ($_todoroki) . The bronze feather spins around once in the unbearable heat and flies out through the open back entrance , not without regret . 
"
13794855,3,54,"The other denizens of the shop , with no ability to form thoughts and make decisions for themselves , resign helplessly to their inevitable demise together . Todoroki ($_todoroki) nearly envies them . Then , like their final owner , they too disappeared . 
"
13794855,3,55,"Nothing has changed . Not a single thing , since that day when he stumbled into his father 's basement . And nothing ever will , if he stays in the globe . It 'll always be only a piece of ornament , and what good can he do by making it snow ? A cruel joke ; he ca n't even attempt anything to save the things he holds dear . 
"
13794855,3,56,"The inside of the globe stays maddeningly cool and safe , and Todoroki ($_todoroki) hates - no , despises - it for the protection it gives so consistently , so inconsiderately . He has never felt more weak and vulnerable and trapped , here in his indestructible and unfailing prison . Todoroki ($_todoroki) slams his fist against the glass , just once , and yells , an inhuman sound he never thought he 'd make . Just as the cuckoo 's cries before him were swallowed , the inferno pays no heed to his frustrations . 
"
13794855,3,57,"And all around him , everything he 's learnt to love burns .
