13867122,6,1,"Where am I ? 
"
13867122,6,2,"It s pitch black no matter where my eyes look . 
"
13867122,6,3,"Shoto ($_shoto) ! 
"
13867122,6,4,"Who???? 
"
13867122,6,5,"Shoto ($_shoto) please ! 
"
13867122,6,6,"Is that my sister ? 
"
13867122,6,7,"The moment I move forward , a bright light shines to my face . I lift my hands to shield my eyes and as I lower them , my sister appears . 
"
13867122,6,8,"Her body looks half rotten , her once beautiful hair sliding off her skull as the skin drops to the ground . 
"
13867122,6,9,"Her other eye socket is empty and I flinch when a centipede comes out of it . 
"
13867122,6,10,"She opens her mouth and spits black liquid on me and I fall to the ground . I try to get away from her . 
"
13867122,6,11,"I m sorry . 
"
13867122,6,12,"She drops to her knees and grabs my legs . My whole body starts to shake . 
"
13867122,6,13,"Shoto ($_shoto) 
"
13867122,6,14,"Oh god , I m so sorry . 
"
13867122,6,15,"Shoto ($_shoto) why didn t you ($_shoto) help us ? 
"
13867122,6,16,"I m sorry . 
"
13867122,6,17,"She crawls over me , looking down on my fearful face . The blackness from her throat starts to drop on my face as I stare at her unforgiving eyes . 
"
13867122,6,18,"YOU LET US DIE ! 
"
13867122,6,19,"Hey! 
"
13867122,6,20,"My eyes open wide as I tear myself from the nightmare . I see confused look that shines from Bakugou ($_bakugou) s two red orbs as she ($_bakugou) s leaning over me . She ($_bakugou) must have tried to wake me up . I lift my hand to my forehead and sigh . Of course , it was just a dream . I must have fallen asleep at some point . 
"
13867122,6,21,"She ($_bakugou) s still looking at me , waiting for an answer . I don t want to give her ($_bakugou) one . 
"
13867122,6,22,"You were dreaming . She ($_bakugou) says and I close my eyes for a bit before groaning loudly . She ($_bakugou) then pulls away from me as I sit up . She ($_bakugou) sits in front of me and for some reason she ($_bakugou) looks like a cute curious puppy , as strange as it sounds . A nightmare ? 
"
13867122,6,23,"Yeah. I rub my forehead , I hope I won t get a migraine . I haven t had this bad nightmare in a while . 
"
13867122,6,24,"She ($_bakugou) s still waiting so I just get up and stretch a little bit . She ($_bakugou) sighs and stands up too . 
"
13867122,6,25,"I look at the sun and notice it s not too late in the morning . I woke up in a perfect time to get going . 
"
13867122,6,26,"We should get going , we need to go to the nearest town to get slightly more supplies since all we have were meant for one person only . Besides , after that it will take some time to reach the next town . I explain and Bakugou ($_bakugou) silently nods . She ($_bakugou) s being oddly quiet now , usually she ($_bakugou) s more aggressive . 
"
13867122,6,27,"I start to wonder if she ($_bakugou) s slightly worried of me after my nightmare . 
"
13867122,6,28,"Maybe not. 
"
13867122,6,29,"We get up on the horse and she ($_bakugou) seems still quite stiff but not as much as yesterday . 
"
13867122,6,30,"My mind wanders as we ride , she ($_bakugou) sometimes gives me directions but doesn t really speak . I m still thinking about the last night , the information given to me . 
"
13867122,6,31,"It all seems so wrong , all my life I had been taught my ancestor Todoroki Shoto was a great king who kept our country at peace and now 
"
13867122,6,32,"I didn t know what to think of him really . 
"
13867122,6,33,"I looked at the Queen in front of me . She ($_bakugou) seemed to be in thought as well and all I could imagine was the conversation we had had the night before . 
"
13867122,6,34,"She ($_bakugou) refused to talk about it before and I didn t want to push her ($_bakugou) to talk more than she ($_bakugou) already had , but I just had so many questions . 
"
13867122,6,35,"Bak - 
"
13867122,6,36,"Hey look! She ($_bakugou) interrupts me right as I m about to speak . I then look to where she ($_bakugou) s pointing and see village nearby . She ($_bakugou) turns to me and grins . shouldn t we stop and get supplies for the journey right ? 
"
13867122,6,37,"She ($_bakugou) looked surprisingly excited over spotting it and I can t help but to give a faint smile . 
"
13867122,6,38,"Good idea , we should be prepared since who knows how long it will be until we reach the next village . I say and she ($_bakugou) nods before turning around . 
"
13867122,6,39,"When we get to the town I realize I hadn t thought this through . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s clothing stuck out like a sore thumb . Her ($_bakugou) red cape especially was pretty eye catching not to mention her ($_bakugou) exotic look . I pull Damian ($_damian) along with us , I don t dare to leave him ($_damian) tied up anywhere . I take a hold of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulder and she ($_bakugou) looks up to me confused . 
"
13867122,6,40,"Just , follow my lead for a bit . I say and she ($_bakugou) frowns . 
"
13867122,6,41,"Why the hell should I follow you around like a lost puppy ? She ($_bakugou) asks , expression sour . 
"
13867122,6,42,"You haven t been out in human towns in a while , no one knows about dragon riders so you look little out of place . I explain and she ($_bakugou) then groans but nods . I think we should buy a map . 
"
13867122,6,43,"Are you implying I don t know where we re going ? She ($_bakugou) asks and I swear I m jumping from a mine to another . 
"
13867122,6,44,"That is not it , it s just means that we would know where the closest towns are . I explain and then I pull out my money pouch from our bag . I look in it , I still got a decent amount of money . Should be enough for supplies and a map , not enough for another horse though . 
"
13867122,6,45,"I got money too you know ? I look at her ($_bakugou) and she ($_bakugou) then unwraps a small pouch on her ($_bakugou) hip . She ($_bakugou) gives it to me and I look inside it . I sigh and Bakugou ($_bakugou) tilts her ($_bakugou) head in confusion . 
"
13867122,6,46,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) - 
"
13867122,6,47,"Queen Bakugou . 
"
13867122,6,48,"Well since I_m ($_i) technically a king I m pretty sure we can call each other just with our names without titles right ? I say with a frown and she ($_bakugou) looks at me little pissed off . 
"
13867122,6,49,"You lost your kingdom . She ($_bakugou) says , hands on her ($_bakugou) hips . 
"
13867122,6,50,"So did you . I throw back to her ($_bakugou) and she ($_bakugou) then looks away with an irritated expression . 
"
13867122,6,51,"Whatever Half-and-half bastard . She ($_bakugou) then says . 
"
13867122,6,52,"Todoroki Shoto . 
"
13867122,6,53,"I_m ($_i) not calling you that . 
"
13867122,6,54,"I sigh and then give her ($_bakugou) her ($_bakugou) pouch back . 
"
13867122,6,55,"Anyway , this money is outdated . No one uses spirit stones as currency anymore . I explain and she ($_bakugou) looks at the pretty vivid colored stones in her ($_bakugou) pouch . 
"
13867122,6,56,"Huh . Well I never needed to go outside world since we could grow everything in my home . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and I chuckle at her ($_bakugou) cluelessness . It was cute in a way . 
"
13867122,6,57,"Deku ($_deku) never told you ? He ($_deku) uses gold . I ask and she ($_bakugou) then shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
"
13867122,6,58,"Deku ($_deku) was the only one who visits outside world . I never asked him ($_deku) what he ($_deku) was doing , just gave him ($_deku) the whistle to blow into in case he ($_deku) needed me . She ($_bakugou) explains . 
"
13867122,6,59,"I nod in understanding and turn to look at one of the stalls . I can still feel people s stares on us and it feels slightly uncomfortable after living as nobody for half an year . 
"
13867122,6,60,"I notice Bakugou ($_bakugou) looking at necklaces and that makes me think of the fact that she ($_bakugou) uses a lot . 
"
13867122,6,61,"More stares. I start to think it would have been better for make her ($_bakugou) stay and wait for a bit . 
"
13867122,6,62,"After a while I finally find a stall that sells maps . After taking one on my hand I realize it s much more updated than the one I had used when I was looking for the Dragon riders in the first place . 
"
13867122,6,63,"I then notice something , on the map it speaks of the hidden path between the mountains . One that usually travellers used , I need to ask Bakugou ($_bakugou) where on the map Evergarden should be . Maybe we could use this path and save us some time ! 
"
13867122,6,64,"Your wife left . Is that okay? 
"
13867122,6,65,"I lift my eyes from the map when I m spoken to . The salesman smiles to me rather kindly . 
"
13867122,6,66,"I m sorry ? I ask , little dumbfounded . 
"
13867122,6,67,"Your wife , the woman who travelled with you . 
"
13867122,6,68,"I turn to look behind myself and groan . Of course , all I asked was for her to stay close to me and of course she wouldn t listen to me . 
"
13867122,6,69,"I m sorry , how much for this map ? I ask . 
"
13867122,6,70,"Bitch what did you say !? 
"
13867122,6,71,"I manage to find her not too far away after buying all the supplies we needed . She s standing near the wall surrounded by three big guys , it takes me a moment to notice the young looking girl sitting behind her . 
"
13867122,6,72,"I start to see what s going on . 
"
13867122,6,73,"Want me to repeat to you ? I can see you re dumb but didn t expect you to be deaf as well ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouts hands on her ($_bakugou) hips . 
"
13867122,6,74,"Great . This is great . This is really subtle . 
"
13867122,6,75,"People are starting to gather around , curious of what s with all the ruckus and it s definitely not what we needed . 
"
13867122,6,76,"The man becomes all red and I can just see the anger fuming inside him . 
"
13867122,6,77,"Suddenly he brings up his fist and I almost drop the bag I m holding . I don t manage to do anything when she ($_bakugou) easily dodges and grabs the man s wrist . His friends look little shocked . 
"
13867122,6,78,"I see , you are deaf after all . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and then proceeds to kick the man twice her ($_bakugou) size in his abdomen . 
"
13867122,6,79,"He grunts and his friend tries to attack her ($_bakugou) now too . I drop the bag on the ground and tell Damian ($_damian) to stay put . 
"
13867122,6,80,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) dodges another hit and then strikes him with an uppercut . When he stumbles back she ($_bakugou) grins wildly . 
"
13867122,6,81,"She ($_bakugou) doesn t pull out her ($_bakugou) sword which I know is bad news . 
"
13867122,6,82,"There comes one spark right as I manage to grab her ($_bakugou) hand . She ($_bakugou) turns to me looking shocked and I m about to speak when I get a hard hit on my face from one of the thugs . 
"
13867122,6,83,"I fall on my knees on the ground with a hiss escaping my lips . 
"
13867122,6,84,"Half-and-half bastard !? She ($_bakugou) shouts and turns around . You ($_bakugou) little shit - 
"
13867122,6,85,"Don t ! 
"
13867122,6,86,"She ($_bakugou) turns to me when I shout . I then notice all the people looking at us confused . 
"
13867122,6,87,"They re whispering , they must have seen that she ($_bakugou) was about to do something . That or they saw the first spark from her ($_bakugou) explosion power . 
"
13867122,6,88,"The girl who is sitting next to me looks little surprised and I urge her ($_bakugou) to run already . She ($_bakugou) quickly whispers her ($_bakugou) thanks before making a break for it . 
"
13867122,6,89,"I then quickly get up on my feet and Bakugou ($_bakugou) prepares to fight when I grab her ($_bakugou) hand . 
"
13867122,6,90,"She ($_bakugou) turns to look at me surprised when I look at her ($_bakugou) with dead panned expression . 
"
13867122,6,91,"Let s run . 
"
13867122,6,92,"Wha - !? 
"
13867122,6,93,"I pull her ($_bakugou) with me without warning and the three guys look surprised to see us run . They then start to shout after us , I do n't stay to listen . I grab my bag from the ground and whistle for Damian who begins to follow us . 
"
13867122,6,94,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouts curses to me but I don t have time to stay and listen . 
"
13867122,6,95,"I finally stop to catch my breath when we re in a good distance . Damian ($_damian) comes to snuffle my hair to see if I m alright , he ($_damian) doesn t seem to understand what was the matter . 
"
13867122,6,96,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) sounds a little out of breath too as her ($_bakugou) curses had quieted down . She ($_bakugou) then noticed that we re still holding hands and pulls her ($_bakugou) hand free . When I lift my eyes from the ground I realize how flushed her ($_bakugou) cheeks are . 
"
13867122,6,97,"Why the hell we ran !? She ($_bakugou) questions . We could have easily taken them on , or I could have at least . 
"
13867122,6,98,"I don t doubt that at all . I respond , trying to steady my breathing . I then swallow a bit before exhaling loudly . But that wasn t the problem . 
"
13867122,6,99,"Then what was !? She ($_bakugou) asks , throwing her ($_bakugou) hands around . 
"
13867122,6,100,"Bakugou ($_bakugou) , you ($_bakugou) do understand that the magic isn t exactly common anymore ? I ask . 
"
13867122,6,101,"Obviously , since my father put the well to sleep for hundreds of years . She ($_bakugou) says with arched brow . 
"
13867122,6,102,"Right. So you ($_bakugou) do know that you ($_bakugou) can t use magic out in public ? 
"
13867122,6,103,"Why not? Why should I care ? She ($_bakugou) asks with a sour expression . 
"
13867122,6,104,"Because they will not understand ! 
"
13867122,6,105,"I take a deep breath , I then apologize and I half expect her ($_bakugou) to lash out on me . She ($_bakugou) doesn t , she ($_bakugou) stands there waiting for the explanation . 
"
13867122,6,106,"I just , they don t understand your power . They might think you re someone dangerous , who knows they might even attack you . Before Tomura attacked my kingdom we only spoke of magic as something dark and evil . Given to humans by devil . I explain . 
"
13867122,6,107,"Do you think that way ? She ($_bakugou) asks me and I turn to her ($_bakugou) surprised . 
"
13867122,6,108,"I don t know enough about magic to make that conclusion . I say and she ($_bakugou) shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
"
13867122,6,109,"That s not what I meant . Do you think I m a witch or evil ? She ($_bakugou) asks and I stare at her ($_bakugou) for a moment . 
"
13867122,6,110,"Of course not . You are short-tempered for sure - I begin and she ($_bakugou) looks a little pissed off . - but you don t seem like the type of person to use your powers for evil . 
"
13867122,6,111,"Her ($_bakugou) eyes widen a bit and then she ($_bakugou) turns away clicking her ($_bakugou) tongue . 
"
13867122,6,112,"How cheesy. She ($_bakugou) says and turns to Damian . I look at her ($_bakugou) confused as she ($_bakugou) walks over to the horse . But fine , whatever you say . I try not to use my powers unless it s an extreme emergency . 
"
13867122,6,113,"I blink few times before sighing in relief . I thank her ($_bakugou) as she ($_bakugou) carefully places her ($_bakugou) hand on Damian ($_damian) s head . Patting him ($_damian) awkwardly . 
"
13867122,6,114,"He ($_damian) 's a strong horse . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and I nod in agreement . What do you call him ($_damian) ? 
"
13867122,6,115,"I don t know what his ($_damian) real name is , but I 'm used to calling him ($_damian) Damian ($_damian) . I explain . She ($_bakugou) just nods , acknowledging my words . I can t help but to smile a little , maybe she ($_bakugou) 's getting over her ($_bakugou) fear of horses . I then remember the map and bring it to her ($_bakugou) . 
"
13867122,6,116,"Do you think you can tell where the Evergarden used to be in this map ? I ask her ($_bakugou) and she ($_bakugou) leans in to see better . She ($_bakugou) studies it for a while , making me realize she ($_bakugou) might not have much idea of how much the world has changed since she ($_bakugou) was gone . 
"
13867122,6,117,"She ($_bakugou) then suddenly points at the certain point on the map and my mouth fall open in surprise . 
"
13867122,6,118,"You are kidding . There s nothing but wasteland here . I say and she ($_bakugou) shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
"
13867122,6,119,"Evergarden ($_evergarden) was hidden just like my ($_evergarden) home was . Of course it s not marked in the maps directly . Bakugou ($_bakugou) explains to me with a bored expression . We can use this passage to get to Evergarden ($_evergarden) quickest . 
"
13867122,6,120,"I turn to look at the route I had noticed earlier on the map , she ($_bakugou) 's right . We don t have to waste time on longer routes that would usually take us through the northern side of the country . 
"
13867122,6,121,"Now that I think about it , it s almost laughable that I 've spend half a year searching through all of north while looking for the dragon riders . 
"
13867122,6,122,"I hear Bakugou ($_bakugou) call out to me as she ($_bakugou) gets on the horse and I decide to look through the map a little more later . 
"
13867122,6,123,"As we ride , I flinch when Bakugou ($_bakugou) leans against my chest . I look down and notice that she ($_bakugou) s in fact fallen asleep . 
"
13867122,6,124,"Normally I would ride fast as we can t waste time but I slow down now . Her ($_bakugou) breathing is steady and I 'm glad she ($_bakugou) 's feeling relaxed on horseback compared to when we first rode together . 
"
13867122,6,125,"I smile bit before looking at the map on her ($_bakugou) lap . I then realize something when I look closer , this path . 
"
13867122,6,126,"This shortcut . 
"
13867122,6,127,"It s leading to south , towards the city of fire . 
"
13867122,6,128,"Shoto ! 
"
13867122,6,129,"My eyes look at the spot on the map , I should have known . My grip from the reins tighten . 
"
13867122,6,130,"My father like all the leaders before him , swore an oath to serve the Todoroki bloodline . 
"
13867122,6,131,"Of course there was a path leading straight to that place . 
"
13867122,6,132,"Leading straight to my home . 
"
