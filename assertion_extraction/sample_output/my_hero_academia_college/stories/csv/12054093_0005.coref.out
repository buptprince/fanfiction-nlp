12054093,5,1,"A few weeks had passed since Midoriya ($_midoriya) had come to be in Todoroki ($_todoroki) s service , and he ($_midoriya) was finally getting used to Enten s culture and the complexities that existed within the castle walls . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s head rested comfortably upon the plush pillows that littered his ($_midoriya) bed , a soft breeze blew in from the open balcony windows offering a nice reprieve from the hot nights . His ($_midoriya) chest rose and fell , soft sighs falling from his ($_midoriya) lips as dreams stirred in his ($_midoriya) mind . However , the dreams parted as his ($_midoriya) eyes snapped open and he ($_midoriya) jolted upright in bed ; the sound of a scream reached his ($_midoriya) ears . The sound liquified itself into his ($_midoriya) veins ; ice cold water that made his ($_midoriya) blood run cold and his ($_midoriya) heart fly up into his ($_midoriya) throat . The scream faded into silence , with a few terse seconds passing by before it came again . 
"
12054093,5,2,"It sounded like a wounded animal , a sound Midoriya had heard plenty of times before when he ($_midoriya) had accompanied All Might on a hunt and had to watch the man end the life of a wounded animal he ($_midoriya) had caught . Though the scream reminded Midoriya ($_midoriya) of that moment , there was a distinctly human quality to it that had his ($_midoriya) gaze being pulled toward the door that connected him ($_midoriya) to the prince s room . Without so much as a thought , he ($_midoriya) threw back the covers on the bed and raced toward the door on bare feet . Throwing open the door , he ($_midoriya) shouted for the_prince ($_the) as his ($_midoriya) gaze swiveled toward Todoroki ($_todoroki) s bed . 
"
12054093,5,3,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) bolted upright , sweat shining against his ($_midoriya) skin as he ($_midoriya) quickly clapped his ($_midoriya) left hand over the left side of his ($_midoriya) face to hide the flesh beneath it from Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes . 
"
12054093,5,4,"Your highness ? Worry threaded Midoriya ($_midoriya) s voice as he ($_midoriya) took a step towards the_prince ($_the) s bed . From his ($_midoriya) position Midoriya ($_midoriya) could see the slight tremor wracking Todoroki ($_todoroki) s body . 
"
12054093,5,5,"Get out. Those words came as a whisper , Midoriya ($_midoriya) craned his ($_midoriya) neck slightly forward to better hear them . A deep frown settled upon his ($_midoriya) face , his ($_midoriya) brows pinching together . 
"
12054093,5,6,"Your highness . Midoriya ($_midoriya) took a step forward , the action bringing out a whirlwind of fury from the prince that smothered him ($_midoriya) . 
"
12054093,5,7,"Get out! Todoroki ($_todoroki) roared , ice climbed up from his ($_tsuyu) right wrist to his ($_tsuyu) elbow , a chilly vapor curling off of him ($_tsuyu) as his ($_tsuyu) fingers dug into the fabric of his ($_tsuyu) bed . Get out! 
"
12054093,5,8,"Jumping slightly , Midoriya ($_midoriya) didn t waste a second as he ($_tsuyu) turned on his ($_tsuyu) heels and rushed out of the room , slamming the door connecting both of their rooms shut behind him ($_tsuyu) . His ($_tsuyu) heart throbbed rapidly in his ($_tsuyu) chest as he ($_tsuyu) leaned back against the door , pressing his ($_tsuyu) green curls into the rough grains of the wood . 
"
12054093,5,9,"What had just happened back there? 
"
12054093,5,10,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) didn t get much sleep after that ; the orange outline of the sun soon poked its head above the horizon , trails of rosy pink and reddish orange streaks littered to sky to inform him ($_tsuyu) that he ($_tsuyu) needed to start his ($_tsuyu) day along with the rest of the servants in the castle . He ($_tsuyu) quickly dressed and made his ($_tsuyu) way down to the kitchens where a smiling Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) quickly set about making the_prince ($_the) s breakfast and morning tea for him ($_tsuyu) . 
"
12054093,5,11,"Pressing his ($_tsuyu) hand against his ($_tsuyu) mouth , Midoriya ($_midoriya) loudly yawned , tears pricking the corners of his ($_tsuyu) eyes . 
"
12054093,5,12,"You look tired . 
"
12054093,5,13,"He ($_tsuyu) nodded , quickly wiping the tears from the corners of his ($_tsuyu) eyes away . I didn t get much sleep last night since the_prince ($_the) woke me up . 
"
12054093,5,14,"Was it the nightmares ? 
"
12054093,5,15,"The surprise on his ($_tsuyu) face must have been apparent as Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) answered the question that was beginning to form on his ($_tsuyu) lips . Almost all the entire castle staff knows about the_prince ($_the) s nightmares . Her voice dropped to a whisper . After all . I m usually the one who has to mix the medicine into the_prince ($_the) s tea so that he ($_the) calms down after he ($_the) has one . As if to show him ($_the) what she meant , she moved to a kitchen drawer , yanked it open and pressed her fingers underneath it . Midoriya ($_midoriya) heard a soft click as a secret compartment within the drawer opened . She reached into the drawer , lifting up a little panel of wood to expose a line of cream colored packets within . She directed Midoriya ($_midoriya) to grab the_prince ($_the) s cup and fill it ($_the) with freshly boiled water ; he ($_the) did so and placed the cup in front of her . 
"
12054093,5,16,"Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) went about preparing the_prince ($_the) s tea , retrieving a small golden orb she dropped in into the cup and slightly smacked it with the back of a spoon . Cracking open , the outer shell of the orb dissolved into the water , turning it a slightly golden color as small flowers and dried petals floated out across the surface . Retrieving a packet from the drawer , she ripped an end open and dumped the white , odorless powder into the tea . 
"
12054093,5,17,"Asui 
"
12054093,5,18,"Please call me , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) . The kitchen girl smiled at him ($_tsuyu) as she went about setting up the breakfast tray . 
"
12054093,5,19,"Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , has the_prince ($_the) always had these nightmares ? 
"
12054093,5,20,"She shrugged as she placed down a plate piled high with scrambled eggs down onto the wooden tray . I heard way before I began to even work in this castle that the nightmares only began after the queen left . Chef . The large man lifted tore his gaze away from the pot he was busily stirring . Isn t that right ? 
"
12054093,5,21,"The man nodded his head in confirmation . 
"
12054093,5,22,"What was the queen like ? For the prince to have such worrying nightmares regarding her ? 
"
12054093,5,23,"The chef s face paled at the question . I can t say . Besides it s better to put such questions away and never bring them up again . 
"
12054093,5,24,"Confusion swept over Midoriya ($_midoriya) again . Why? No one here to seems to even so much as mention the queen s name not to mention there s hardly any portraits within the castle walls of her visage and her thrown remains empty . Did something happ 
"
12054093,5,25,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) ! Chef roared his name in such a manner that it shook the very bones of his body . The man dropped his voice to a soft whisper . I beg of you , to never mention the queen within these walls much less to the prince himself , or else you re begging to have your head displayed on the walls . Do you hear me ? 
"
12054093,5,26,"He nodded as the chef implored Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) to hand him the tray so he could quickly leave the kitchen . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) complied , quickly placing the rest of the_prince ($_the) s breakfast onto the tray she handed it ($_tsuyu) over to him with an apologetic frown on her face . 
"
12054093,5,27,"Soothing her own feelings , he gave her a quick smile before leaving the kitchen and walking up the several flights of stairs that lead him up from the kitchen and toward the section of the castle that housed the_prince ($_the) s room . A trio of guards were patrolling the hallway , keeping his head bowed , he did his best to avoid being noticed by them . 
"
12054093,5,28,"It didn t seem to work . 
"
12054093,5,29,"As he and the guards passed by each other , the senior of the three a commander by the phoenix shaped badge on his chest reached out , smacking the tray out of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s hands , the cup of tea splashed against his tunic before falling to the floor and shattering in several pieces aside the food that now decorated the cobbled stone floor . 
"
12054093,5,30,"The commander , a man who appeared to be in his late twenties , had blond hair flowing down his back , giving him the appearance of a lion . Haven t they taught you servants to be more conscious of your surroundings ? 
"
12054093,5,31,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) said nothing as he ($_midoriya) bent down to the ground , picking up a shard of broken ceramic and tossing it onto the slightly cracked tray . A flash of anger swept across the commander s face , settling into a practiced mask of apathy as he ($_midoriya) lifted a boot covered foot and brought it down onto Midoriya ($_midoriya) s hand . He ($_midoriya) let out a sharp howl as the boot dug into his ($_midoriya) tender skin . A devilish smirk stretched across the commander s face . 
"
12054093,5,32,"Oops , he ($_midoriya) hissed , You should really be more careful where you put your hands , you could end up losing one of them if a guard just so happens to be swinging his sword around by accident . 
"
12054093,5,33,"Refusing to bow underneath the pressure of such a threat , Midoriya ($_midoriya) ignored his ($_midoriya) own steadily crumbling advice to lift his ($_midoriya) head in order to glare into the commander s eyes . A flicker of scorn flashed across the man s face , removing his foot from Midoriya ($_midoriya) s hands , he simply stared down at the servant . Attempting to clean up the mess now littering the floor , Midoriya ($_midoriya) didn t have so much as a moment to let out a yelp of surprise as his back and head smacked against the rough stones of the wall ; the air expelling from his lungs in a sharp wheeze . His teeth clacked together , the coppery taste of blood in his mouth welled upon the tip of his tongue . 
"
12054093,5,34,"Bringing their faces closer together , Midoriya ($_midoriya) grimaced in pain as the commander s bright green eyes , flecked with little spots of brown flickered over the expanse of his face . The fabric around the collar of his shirt , bunched up between the man s hands as his feet dangled a few inches off of the ground . 
"
12054093,5,35,"What is going on here? 
"
12054093,5,36,"Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) stood just a few feet away from the foursome , a scowl twisted on her ($_yaoyorozu) face as her ($_yaoyorozu) eyes raked over the spilt food on the floor , the shattered dishes and Midoriya ($_midoriya) pinned up against the wall . Eyes narrowing , she ($_yaoyorozu) took a threatening step forward as she ($_yaoyorozu) jerked her ($_yaoyorozu) chin in the commander s direction . What do you ($_yaoyorozu) think you ($_yaoyorozu) re doing to the prince s personal servant ? 
"
12054093,5,37,"The commander let go off Midoriya ($_midoriya) s collar , his hands jerking backward , fingers spread apart as he held up his hands in front of him . A sly smile stretched across his face as he looked in Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) s direction . His smile may have been friendly , but the coldness and disgust that burned in his eyes implicated his true feelings toward her ($_yaoyorozu) . Why nothing , just having a good , friendly chat with the servant . After all , it s our duty to make him feel welcomed to the castle . 
"
12054093,5,38,"He s had enough time to adjust to our culture within these castle walls , she ($_yaoyorozu) hissed out between her ($_yaoyorozu) teeth . I suggest you ($_yaoyorozu) continue your ($_yaoyorozu) rounds or else I ll have to report that you ($_yaoyorozu) re the reason as to why the_prince ($_the) s breakfast arrived so late . 
"
12054093,5,39,"The commander released a huff of incredulous annoyance , before motioning for the two other guards to follow him . Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) kept a steely gaze upon her ($_yaoyorozu) face as the guards passed by her ($_yaoyorozu) , however , the commander stopped in his tracks . Bringing his lips close to her ($_yaoyorozu) ears , he whispered a threat that even Midoriya ($_midoriya) could hear . 
"
12054093,5,40,"If I were you ($_yaoyorozu) , I would sleep with an eye open from now on . 
"
12054093,5,41,"The guards left , leaving Midoriya ($_midoriya) and Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) alone in the hallway . Straightening his rumpled clothing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) got down on his hands and knees , quickly reaching for the broken shards of plates and the tea cup . 
"
12054093,5,42,"Here. Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) was beside him , a tired smile stretched across her ($_yaoyorozu) face as she ($_yaoyorozu) handed him a larger broken shard from one of the plates . 
"
12054093,5,43,"He mumbled a thanks as he took the shard from her ($_yaoyorozu) hand and tossed it onto the tray . 
"
12054093,5,44,"It s rough being the new person in the castle , Midoriya ($_midoriya) glanced at Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) s face to see that she ($_yaoyorozu) was staring at him , her ($_yaoyorozu) eyes taking a misty , distant look to them , But you get used to it eventually . 
"
12054093,5,45,"You say that as if you ve had a lot of practice with it . Eyes narrowing , his lip stretched out into a thin line . And it doesn t seem like you re especially used to it . 
"
12054093,5,46,"She ($_yaoyorozu) hummed , a sound of displeasure rumbling in her ($_yaoyorozu) throat . Reaching up with her ($_yaoyorozu) hand , she ($_yaoyorozu) tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ($_yaoyorozu) ear . I m grateful to be working in the castle serving under the_Prince ($_the) , she ($_yaoyorozu) shrugged her ($_yaoyorozu) shoulders , it s better than probably being married off to a rich bastard by now and having my third kid . 
"
12054093,5,47,"What? His voice reverberated off of the walls ; the incredulousness he felt could hardly be contained by the implication of her ($_yaoyorozu) words . But I thought you could get married out of love here ? 
"
12054093,5,48,"Sharp laughter that bubbled out past Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) s lips startled him . It s best that you quickly remove whatever naive notions of this country and our culture that you have from your head . Lightly shaking her ($_yaoyorozu) own head , she ($_yaoyorozu) continued . Women here , to some extent have the same freedoms as men ; we re free at night ($_night) to play with whomever we fancy , our futures , however , are just decided for us . 
"
12054093,5,49,"He bit down upon his tongue to keep himself from asking her ($_yaoyorozu) if she ($_yaoyorozu) played with the_prince ($_the) at night ($_night) . 
"
12054093,5,50,"I know in Shuei , it s more common for marriages to be made because of love , but just because our two countries are neighbors , doesn t mean Enten follows the same values as Shuei ($_shuei) . She ($_yaoyorozu) observed him ($_shuei) as he ($_shuei) used a broken shard to scoop up the smashed pieces of what used to be a trio of hard boiled eggs . Here it s far more common for Quirk marriages to occur , arranged marriages to gain financial or political influence or in order to raise a houses social standing . 
"
12054093,5,51,"The two of them finished quickly cleaning up the mess . Standing up , Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) brushed her ($_yaoyorozu) hands together , there was something pensive about the way she ($_yaoyorozu) stared down at Midoriya ($_midoriya) . I m grateful towards him ($_shuei) . He ($_shuei) saved me during a time I was uncertain of myself and my future looked incredibly bleak . Turning her ($_yaoyorozu) head , she ($_yaoyorozu) looked fondly at a banner upon the wall , just below the depiction of the phoenix in the center of a burning sun was the crown prince s personal emblem . I simply serve the_prince ($_the) as a way to pay him ($_the) back for everything he ($_the) s done for me . 
"
12054093,5,52,"Turning her ($_yaoyorozu) gaze back upon Midoriya ($_midoriya) , a shiver ran down his ($_the) spine at the subdued fire that burned within her ($_yaoyorozu) eyes . It wasn t the bloodthirsty and impassioned heat that he ($_the) felt from the king or the cold , indifference that he ($_the) got from the_prince ($_the) . This fire coming from her ($_yaoyorozu) , was a fire that looked small , but was equally , if not far more dangerous than the others . He ($_the) felt a nervous smile stretch across his ($_the) face as a droplet of sweat traced down the side of his ($_the) face and curved underneath his ($_the) chin . 
"
12054093,5,53,"And if anything happened to him ($_the) A smile stretched across her ($_yaoyorozu) face , exposing the whites of her ($_yaoyorozu) teeth . I d make sure those who did it , suffer greatly . 
"
12054093,5,54,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) sighed to himself ($_midoriya) as he ($_midoriya) stood outside the_prince ($_the) s bedroom door , an entirely fresh new tray of breakfast resting in his ($_midoriya) hands . After cleaning up the mess , he ($_midoriya) had rushed back down to the kitchen s with the broken tray in hand . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) had shared a glance with Chef as Midoriya ($_midoriya) had laughed and told her ($_tsuyu) that he ($_midoriya) had been clumsy and dropped the tray on his ($_midoriya) way to the prince s room , he ($_midoriya) knew the both of them didn t quite believe him ($_midoriya) , but they weren t about to challenge his ($_midoriya) claim either . 
"
12054093,5,55,"Chef quickly prepared the_prince ($_the) s breakfast again as Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) set about remaking the tea , the two of them quickly giving Midoriya ($_midoriya) a new tray and imploring him ($_midoriya) to rush toward the_prince ($_the) s room as he ($_midoriya) would undoubtedly be more than upset about the lateness of his ($_midoriya) meal . 
"
12054093,5,56,"Swallowing down the trepidation that had built in his ($_midoriya) throat , he ($_midoriya) opened the door to see that the_prince ($_the) was already sitting at the small table in his ($_midoriya) room . The balcony windows had been thrown open , letting a warm breeze into the room , his ($_midoriya) bare back was facing Midoriya ($_midoriya) . The golden ribbon of his ($_midoriya) mask was already fastened onto his ($_midoriya) head as he ($_midoriya) turned his ($_midoriya) face to gaze at Midoriya ($_midoriya) , so that his ($_midoriya) turquoise colored eye was the only one he ($_midoriya) was gazing at . 
"
12054093,5,57,"You re late . 
"
12054093,5,58,"Inclining his ($_midoriya) head slightly , Midoriya ($_midoriya) apologized . I m sorry for my lateness . I had to get your breakfast prepared again as I tripped this_morning ($_this) on my way here . 
"
12054093,5,59,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) studied Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , his ($_midoriya) eyes flickering over his ($_midoriya) servants features . Is that what truly happened this_morning ($_this) ? 
"
12054093,5,60,"Yes. 
"
12054093,5,61,"The_prince ($_the) continued to stare at him ($_midoriya) , for a moment he ($_midoriya) was sure the_prince ($_the) would call him ($_midoriya) out on the blatant lie but he ($_midoriya) said nothing , simply motioned with his ($_midoriya) hand for Midoriya ($_midoriya) to bring him ($_midoriya) his ($_midoriya) meal . Setting the tray down upon the table , he ($_midoriya) picked out the outfit the_prince ($_the) would wear for the day and laid it down upon the bed as Todoroki ($_todoroki) hurriedly ate . He ($_midoriya) glanced at him ($_midoriya) from the corners of his ($_midoriya) eyes ; Todoroki ($_todoroki) looked far more calmer than he ($_midoriya) had last_night ($_last) . If he ($_midoriya) had anything to say to Midoriya about the events of last_night ($_last) he ($_midoriya) made no mention of it . 
"
12054093,5,62,"Finishing his ($_midoriya) breakfast , Midoriya ($_midoriya) dressed him ($_midoriya) and was fastening the laces on his ($_midoriya) leather boots when there was a knock on the door . Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) let herself ($_yaoyorozu) in , giving a quick nod to Midoriya before escorting the two of them down to the courtyard where the guards were already lined up . Midoriya ($_midoriya) noticed that in the front row right next to the guard Todoroki ($_todoroki) had embarrassed previously was the commander he ($_midoriya) had run into what seemed like an eternity ago . 
"
12054093,5,63,"The man fixed his ($_midoriya) eyes upon Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , a gaze Midoriya ($_midoriya) was all too quick in avoiding , choosing instead to focus his ($_midoriya) own gaze on a pair of blooming fire lilies that had been planted along the courtyard . The flowers letting off a heady fragrance that reminded one of a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon , the red-orange petals bowed their heads underneath the sun . As he ($_midoriya) tore his ($_midoriya) gaze away from the flowers , he ($_midoriya) was startled to see Todoroki ($_todoroki) had fixed his ($_midoriya) eyes upon him ($_midoriya) . 
"
12054093,5,64,"He ($_midoriya) wondered how long the_teen ($_midoriya) had been staring at him ($_midoriya) for . Todoroki ($_todoroki) turned to the knights , ordering them to pair up with one another so that they could sparr as he ($_midoriya) , Yaoyorozu and Midoriya ($_midoriya) went over to a large parasol that another servant was holding above his own head . There was a chair and a small table underneath the parasol that was laden with a pitcher of water , a cup and a plate stacked high with fresh fruit and cheeses . 
"
12054093,5,65,"Sitting down in the chair , Midoriya and Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) took their places beside Todoroki ($_todoroki) s side . Midoriya ($_midoriya) remained silent as Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) leaned in toward Todoroki ($_todoroki) s ear , she ($_midoriya) smiled at something he ($_midoriya) said and let out a laugh that was soft and breathy . His ($_midoriya) eyes swept over the courtyard , studying the soldiers stances and forms as his ($_midoriya) fingers twitched and itched for the weight of a sword between them .

12054093,5,66,"It made him ($_midoriya) antsy , the feeling of watching these soldiers train for weeks whereas he ($_midoriya) spent any freetime he ($_midoriya) could in the castle s library studying up on the fighting style of Enten that was vastly different from his ($_midoriya) home country s . He ($_midoriya) was especially focused on the commander , Midoriya ($_midoriya) noticed that the_man ($_midoriya) s left hand was a little too close to the pommel of his ($_midoriya) sword , when he ($_midoriya) swung , he ($_midoriya) left his ($_midoriya) chest slightly open , leaving him ($_midoriya) with too many openings in which an enemy could thrust a sword into his ($_midoriya) chest . His ($_midoriya) eyes narrowing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned as the commander took a big step forward in order to slash at his ($_midoriya) sparring partner , using the momentum and weight of his ($_midoriya) own body rather than pivoting to the side and following the swing of his ($_midoriya) sword .

12054093,5,86,"Breathing slowly , Midoriya ($_midoriya) attempted to calm his ($_midoriya) nerves as he ($_midoriya) let the weight of the longsword comfortably rest in his ($_midoriya) hand . Loosening his ($_midoriya) grip and then tightening it , he ($_midoriya) slightly tipped the sword in his ($_midoriya) hand to get a better feeling for it . Staring at the ground , Midoriya ($_midoriya) did anything he ($_midoriya) could to avoid the commander s gaze . The_man ($_midoriya) s armor gleamed underneath the afternoon sun ; combined with the golden locks that tumbled down his ($_midoriya) back gave him ($_midoriya) a regal , leonine appearance . 
"
12054093,5,87,"Though this lion was one that was ready to press its fangs into its prey s neck , feeling the muscle and sinews crunch beneath its teeth as blood splattered into its maw . He knew he was that very prey .

12054093,5,88,"A sharp shout forced Midoriya ($_midoriya) to lift his ($_midoriya) head , the commander raced toward him ($_midoriya) , his ($_midoriya) longword held aloft the edge of his ($_midoriya) body . Gasping , he ($_midoriya) quickly lifted his ($_midoriya) blade and slightly rotated it so that the left side of the quillion pointed upward , catching the commander s blade in between the cross of his ($_midoriya) blade and the edge of his ($_midoriya) hilt . Keeping his ($_midoriya) grip firm on the hilt of his ($_midoriya) sword , Midoriya ($_midoriya) twisted his ($_midoriya) upper torso , knocking the commander s sword aside . He ($_midoriya) let his ($_midoriya) grip slacken as he ($_midoriya) spun on his ($_midoriya) heels and held the sword behind him ($_midoriya) , the clang of steel against steel pounded in his ($_midoriya) ears . He ($_midoriya) gasped , staggering to the side , the urge to grip his ($_midoriya) side compelling as he ($_midoriya) ground his ($_midoriya) teeth . The skin beneath his ($_midoriya) clothes throbbed from where the end of the commander s pommel had connected with his ($_midoriya) side . 
"
12054093,5,89,"Roaring , the commander swung his blade over his head . Barrel-rolling to the side to avoid the impact of the blade , Midoriya ($_midoriya) missed the steel-covered boot tip that arched toward his ($_midoriya) face ; the crunch of cartilage cut through the air , a warm stream of blood dripped down to his ($_midoriya) lips and chin . Staring incredulously at the commander , his ($_midoriya) tongue darted out between his ($_midoriya) lips to swipe at his ($_midoriya) bottom lip , the taste of coppery blood on the tip of his ($_midoriya) tongue . 
"
12054093,5,90,"He ($_midoriya) was fighting dirty . An incensed look burned in his ($_midoriya) eyes , cheers rising up from behind him ($_midoriya) as the other guards goaded him ($_midoriya) on , clapping their hands together as a drunken sense of near victory washed over them all .

"
12054093,5,93,"His ($_midoriya) gaze flickering back to the prince , Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned at him ($_midoriya) , wondering why the_prince ($_the) had chosen him ($_midoriya) a servant nonetheless to fight against a commander of the guards . It slightly infuriated him ($_midoriya) , to not know what game the_prince ($_the) was playing at and to be enshrouded in the dark . Sinking his ($_midoriya) teeth into his ($_midoriya) bottom lip , he ($_midoriya) also found himself ($_midoriya) slightly intrigued by the_prince ($_the) . Turning his ($_midoriya) attention back to the commander , he ($_midoriya) rushed forward , their swords clashing against each other as they danced back and forth . Taking a swing at the commander s neck , the_man ($_midoriya) took a stumbling step back .

12054093,5,95,"Their blades met again ; the sound of steel ringing against steel burning in the air . As the commander attempted to block a blow from Midoriya ($_midoriya) s blade , leaving his side exposed , Midoriya ($_midoriya) lashed out , kicking at his ribs with the bottom of his shoe . The kick sent the commander flying to the ground , his back colliding with the whitewashed stones of the courtyard . He rolled onto his stomach , pushing himself up onto a knee , he pointed the tip of his blade at Midoriya , who knocked aside the tip of his sword with his own . Hopping to his feet , the commander beat back Midoriya ($_midoriya) with his sword .

12054093,5,96,"Seeing an opening , Midoriya ($_midoriya) turned , keeping his ($_midoriya) sword pressed against his ($_midoriya) back as he ($_midoriya) blocked the oncoming blow that sent a shiver through his ($_midoriya) bones . Reaching out with his ($_midoriya) free arm , he ($_midoriya) elbowed the golden-haired man in the back of his ($_midoriya) head , sending him ($_midoriya) again tumbling to the ground . Keeping his ($_midoriya) grip tight on his ($_midoriya) sword , the commander broke his ($_midoriya) fall by placing his ($_midoriya) hand flat against the stones . Shooting upright , he ($_midoriya) caught Midoriya ($_midoriya) s blow with his ($_midoriya) sword and he ($_midoriya) quickly took his ($_midoriya) left hand off the hilt of his ($_midoriya) sword to place on the flat part of his ($_midoriya) blade , blocking the next subsequent blow from the servant .

12054093,5,97,"Using the momentum of the block , the commander swung with the pommel of his blade , knocking Midoriya ($_midoriya) to the ground . Midoriya ($_midoriya) gasped as the tip of the commander s blade thrusted downward to the soft flesh of his ($_midoriya) neck , reacting quickly , he ($_midoriya) slid his ($_midoriya) left hand up the flat part of his ($_midoriya) blade , blocking the tip of the commander s sword and pushing it aside so that the sound of metal scraping against stone pierced the air . Drawing back his ($_midoriya) right leg , he ($_midoriya) lashed out , his ($_midoriya) right foot connecting with man s pristine face . He ($_midoriya) could hear the crunch of cartilage underneath his ($_midoriya) boot and knew the_man ($_midoriya) s nose was as broken as his ($_midoriya) .

12054093,5,98,"An eye for an eye . He ($_midoriya) called out through gritted teeth . He ($_midoriya) hopped up their blades meeting again and again , the cry of the crowd louder now as the guards cheered on their commander . Dropping down to one knee , the crowd fell silent as Midoriya ($_midoriya) s blade slashed across the commander s stomach , a scratched line stretched across the armor covering his torso . The chirp of birds was the only sound in the hushed courtyard . 
"
12054093,5,99,"Staring down at his scratched armor , his eyes wide with shock . The smile that was stretching across Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face fell as the commander raised his eyes ; there was fury in them , but not the fury he had seen earlier , this fury was one of a predator that just had been swiped at by a prey and instead of being delighted at the game was instead infuriated .

The_both_of_them ($_midoriya) jumped to their feet , now barehanded . That didn t seem to stop the commander , who rushed toward Midoriya ($_midoriya) , throwing a punch in his ($_midoriya) direction that sailed past the green-haired teen s cheek , the teen reached behind the man s head and slammed his hand against the side of his skull . Stumbling back a few feet , Midoriya ($_midoriya) walked toward him as the commander attempted to throw another punch that he dodged . He wrapped his arms around the commander s own and threw him down to the ground .

Some of the other servants and maids had flocked to the courtyard no doubt from the sounds or whispers that were currently twisting through the halls about the crown prince s servant sparring with a commander of the knights . Windows above the courtyard had been thrown open , maids leaning out with intoxicated smiles spurred by the match and the shared delight of a mere servant putting a commander in his place and besting him .
