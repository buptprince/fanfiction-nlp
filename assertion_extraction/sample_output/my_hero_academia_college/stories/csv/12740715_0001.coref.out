12740715,1,1,"It s scary , Midoriya ($_midoriya) thinks , to have been chosen for something so important when the most important thing he ($_midoriya) s ever done is sell some of his ($_midoriya) family s animals for more blankets during that one extremely cold winter . Actually , scratch that , it s downright terrifying . There s not a single thing he ($_midoriya) ll ever do that will make him ($_midoriya) more afraid than this will , and maybe that s what really scares him ($_midoriya) . 
"
12740715,1,2,"The Tower of Ai . It s the stuff of legends , having saved the world time and time again because of the Bearer of New Life and the company they kept . Midoriya ($_midoriya) had always looked up to the previous Bearer , All Might , though he ($_midoriya) d supposedly lived hundreds of years ago . And , now , to be tasked with being the_new_Bearer ($_the) , alongside people he ($_midoriya) doesn t even know . . ? To say it s a lot to handle would be an understatement . 
"
12740715,1,3,"Still , though , there s a reason he ($_midoriya) s here . He ($_midoriya) may be easily overwhelmed , but he ($_midoriya) s nothing if not determined , and if the fate of the word rests on his ($_midoriya) shoulders then there s really no other thing to do but to agree and be the_new_bearer ($_the) . 
"
12740715,1,4,"As he ($_midoriya) expects , he ($_midoriya) s the first one at the tower . From the outside , there s nothing to marvel at . In fact , the tower looks as if it s crumbling to dust , and the only fully intact part is the door . He ($_midoriya) s heard enough stories to know that appearances aren t everything , though . There are old books , passed down through the ages about what s really inside the tower , rumored to be written by some of the people who went in the tower alongside the_Bearer ($_the) . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s personal favorite comes from a book by a_man_who_calls_himself_Nighteye ($_iida) himself ($_midoriya) Nighteye , and it explains how huge the tower is from the inside . Bigger on the inside , he ($_midoriya) muses , taking another look at the tower . 
"
12740715,1,5,"It s not that he ($_midoriya) s starting to doubt the legends , or anything . It just seems impossible to him ($_midoriya) that something so old and run-down could have magic . He ($_midoriya) steps closer to the tower and squints . There s an odd looking unlit torch mounted next to the doors , and for an inexplicable reason he ($_midoriya) finds himself ($_midoriya) compelled to reach out to it . 
"
12740715,1,6,"His ($_midoriya) fingertips almost brush the wood of the torch when he ($_midoriya) hears someone addressing him ($_midoriya) . I wouldn t touch that if I were you . Only the_Bearer ($_the) can hold the torch without it breaking . He ($_midoriya) jerks his ($_midoriya) head around - does he ($_midoriya) look too scared ? Probably. He ($_midoriya) can t really help that , though . 
"
12740715,1,7,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) spends an unreasonable amount of time looking at the_man ($_iida) before his ($_iida) mind makes the connection . There s only one person he ($_iida) s heard of that s cold , distant , and has red and white hair . P-prince Todoroki ($_todoroki) ? He ($_iida) mentally curses himself ($_iida) for stuttering . He ($_iida) hasn t really made a good first impression , so far , so he ($_iida) tries to redeem himself ($_iida) by answering , I am the_Bearer ($_the) . Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) . He ($_iida) tries his ($_iida) best to not sound intimidated , really , but it s not working . 
"
12740715,1,8,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) looks at him ($_iida) in what he ($_iida) thinks is disbelief - he ($_iida) can t really tell , because the prince hardly shows any change except the slight widening of his ($_iida) eyes . A quiet and monotone , Is that so ? is his ($_iida) only reply , so he ($_iida) nods and busies himself ($_iida) with observing the tower . Todoroki ($_todoroki) s gaze boring holes into the back of his ($_iida) head is impossible to ignore , but he ($_iida) manages to anyway . 
"
12740715,1,9,"Other people arrive within a few hours . Yaoyorozu Momo , he ($_iida) learns , arrived here with Todoroki ($_todoroki) but chose to explore the surrounding area before coming to the tower itself . He ($_iida) finds her much more pleasant to be around_than_Todoroki ($_todoroki) . The_next_person_he_meets ($_iida) he ($_iida) meets is Iida Tenya - a knight for the kingdom of Ingenium , he ($_iida) s told , sent here by a prophet that was very insistent he ($_iida) needed to be here . He ($_iida) likes Iida ($_iida) , but the knight seems a little too uptight . 
"
12740715,1,10,"Kirishima Eijirou arrives next , with Kaminari Denki in tow , and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s not really sure what to think of either of them . The first of the two a thief and the second a bard , he ($_iida) can hardly imagine why people like this are supposed to help him ($_iida) get past the challenges , but he ($_iida) doesn t question the prophets and doesn t speak to the two troublemakers outside of introductions . 
"
12740715,1,11,"The next person to arrive is someone who seems so bright that Midoriya ($_midoriya) has to look away . Aoyama Yuuga , Midoriya ($_midoriya) gathers , from the loud announcement he ($_iida) made as soon as he ($_iida) stepped out of the golden carriage that had taken him ($_iida) here . He ($_iida) s the prince of something , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) doesn t catch what as he ($_iida) s interrupted by the loud arrival of a pink-skinned girl who calls herself Ashido Mina . That makes eight of them , then , including himself ($_iida) . 
"
12740715,1,12,"The wait for the last two is a bit longer , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds himself ($_midoriya) not minding once he ($_midoriya) sees the strange person that s just walked up . He ($_midoriya) seems to have a bird for a head , and that s even more odd than the pink-skinned girl . Tokoyami_Fumikage ($_tokoyami) is certainly something , with his ($_tokoyami) praises to the darkness . 
"
12740715,1,13,"And then , there s the last person . Midoriya ($_midoriya) expects a lot of things out of the mystery person , but none of those things involves the person being Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) seems to have the same sort of reaction to him ($_midoriya) being here , but it s full of anger rather than surprise . Classic Kacchan_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) thinks , he ($_midoriya) was always trying to be better than me before he ($_midoriya) ran off . Is he ($_midoriya) mad because I m the bearer , or because - 
"
12740715,1,14,"A loud voice interrupts his internal monologuing just as it s barely begun . Midoriya , all nine of the companions have arrived ! It is time for you to take the torch and begin our challenges ! Iida ($_iida) looks very proud , maybe because he ($_iida) s been chosen . He ($_iida) takes one final look around . Todoroki ($_todoroki) is unreadable , Yaoyorozu looks nervous , Kirishima looks excited , Kaminari looks oddly calm , Aoyama seems . . Well , he ($_iida) can t really tell . To his ($_iida) left , Mina looks filled with childish excitement , Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) seems to not care , and he ($_iida) doesn t even dare try to read Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
"
12740715,1,15,"He ($_iida) takes a deep breath and closes his ($_iida) eyes for a minute , regaining himself ($_iida) before walking to the door and grabbing the torch out of its holder . The strange markings on the torch start to glow a cyan color , and the large doors swing open . One ($_one) by one , they ($_one) enter the tower that really is bigger on the inside , some of them ($_one) gawking , Midoriya ($_midoriya) included . Once everyone is inside , the doors slam shut behind him ($_midoriya) . If there had been a fire on his ($_midoriya) torch , it would have blown out by the force of the air . 
"
12740715,1,16,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) takes one last look around at his ($_midoriya) companions before starting down the long hallway in front of him ($_midoriya) . He ($_midoriya) s going to get through the Tower of Ai whether he ($_midoriya) thinks himself ($_midoriya) too weak or not .
