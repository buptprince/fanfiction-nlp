11790183,6,2,"Me ? 
"
11790183,6,3,"The man looked to Momo before saying , Come inside . He coughed in the crook of his elbow . You too , he said to Shouto . 
"
11790183,6,4,"He entered after Momo ($_momo) . The apartment looked simple enough , he thought , as they passed down a narrow walkway . White painted walls accented with cream trimmings and dark blue carpeting that was stiff under his feet . Shouto ($_shouto) could faintly hear what sounded like a television droning on in the background . The man seemed to favor his right side as he treaded ahead of Momo ($_momo) , and Shouto ($_shouto) suspected he was injured in some way . 
"
11790183,6,5,"Sorry for the mess . I wasn t really expecting anyone to come over , especially not you . 
"
11790183,6,6,"Momo ($_momo) shook her head , though it was likely the man didn t see . It s not an issue . I wasn t expecting to come by today , much less with him . 
"
11790183,6,7,"Shouto ($_shouto) wanted to object , to say he ($_shouto) was right there , that he ($_shouto) could hear their every word , but he ($_shouto) stayed silent in the hopes that any additional information may slip through their conversing . He ($_shouto) and Momo ($_momo) made a right at the end of the hallway , and Shouto ($_shouto) followed after them into a small living room . 
"
11790183,6,8,"There , the man lounged on the couch , its upholstery worn and fading . His legs were thrown casually over its failing arms , and his head stood erect atop a thin neck . His blonde hair clung to his insipid skin in a dishevelled mess . Through his mop of hair , Shouto ($_shouto) could faintly make out the gauntness of his frame and the definitive lines of his bones . One of his arms stretched toward a low coffee table to pick up a television remote . He turned off the television , a large flat screen that made Shouto ($_shouto) gulp when he tried to guess its exact size . 
"
11790183,6,9,"The man rubbed his temples . So how exactly is this done ? He looked to Shouto . 
"
11790183,6,10,"I m sorry ? How is what done? 
"
11790183,6,11,"His brows furrowed a bit . The the he made an obscure motion his hands thing . I never thought I d have to face you for something like this , so I would appreciate if this was done quickly , my boy . 
"
11790183,6,12,"Momo ($_momo) shook her head from a chair across the coffee table . He ($_momo) s my charge , er , one of my charges or his ($_momo) body is , at least . I m not too sure about him ($_momo) to be honest Regardless , he ($_momo) isn t here for any business of that nature . 
"
11790183,6,13,"And Shouto ($_shouto) heard the man let out a long sigh that almost sounded relieved . 
"
11790183,6,14,"On the other side of the apartment , a poster caught Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes . When he ($_momo) walked closer to the poster hung on the wall , he ($_momo) found it to be plastered over a small pile of All Might Comics , all signed by the infamous Yagi Toshinori . Shouto ($_shouto) , try as he ($_momo) might , never saw an autographed All Might issue in his ($_momo) life , at least never in person , and his ($_momo) hands itched with the temptation to run his ($_momo) palms along their thin spines . Beside the pile were notes in a sloppy scrawl , all looping lines and rigid stops , beside what seemed to be hastily sketched free hand drawings of All Might in the midst of battle . Whenever_Shouto ($_whenever) seemed ready to return to the man and Momo ($_momo) , he ($_whenever) was prodded by his ($_whenever) own curiosity . A magazine page that seemed to be ripped from its ($_whenever) binding showed a relatively recent Toshinori ($_toshinori) interview at a comic convention . 
"
11790183,6,15,"Are you a big Yagi Toshinori fan ? he ($_whenever) called out . 
"
11790183,6,16,"What? 
"
11790183,6,17,"Shouto ($_shouto) eyed another All Might poster which was sandwiched between notebook pages and folded unevenly and off-center . You have a lot of All Might merch . 
"
11790183,6,18,"I m tempted to ask , are you okay , my boy ? 
"
11790183,6,19,"Huh ($_huh) ? Shouto ($_shouto) made his ($_shouto) way back to the others across the apartment . 
"
11790183,6,20,"I m Yagi Toshinori . When Shouto ($_shouto) nearly tripped over his ($_shouto) feet , he ($_shouto) continued . I assumed you knew . We have met before . A few times , in fact . 
"
11790183,6,21,"I-I don t er , that is I think I d remember something like that , Shouto ($_shouto) sputtered . But Shouto ($_shouto) became immediately suspicious . Izuku ($_izuku) stated before , in his ($_izuku) typical Izuku ($_izuku) fashion , that All_Might ($_all) was a real figure , not just some myth or fictitious superhero . But , if you re Yagi Toshinori , how do you know about All_Might ($_all) ? 
"
11790183,6,22,"I am All_Might ($_all) . 
"
11790183,6,23,"Shouto ($_shouto) s mind went blank for a moment . This was All_Might ($_all) ? This sickly emaciated man laying on the couch ? But you look nothing like Shouto ($_shouto) saw Toshinori ($_toshinori) s eyes harden I m sorry . 
"
11790183,6,24,"Toshinori ($_toshinori) chuckled before rubbing at the back of his ($_toshinori) neck . It s fine , my boy . 
"
11790183,6,25,"And Shouto ($_shouto) should have accepted it ($_shouto) , should ve just left it ($_shouto) alone , but he ($_shouto) instead opened his ($_shouto) mouth and said , So you really rescued a jumper from the ledge of a building ? 
"
11790183,6,26,"Well , there weren t really buildings at the time , but more or less . 
"
11790183,6,27,"And you saved a boy from an evil sludge monster ? 
"
11790183,6,28,"It wasn t exactly a boy , and I had a bit of help . That one was actually a bit more exaggerated than the others Toshinori ($_toshinori) rubbed the back of his ($_toshinori) neck with a sheepish smile . 
"
11790183,6,29,"I ve heard that it s dangerous for creatures like you to just give out your name to anyone . How do you get around everyone knowing Yagi Toshinori ? 
"
11790183,6,30,"Ah! That well it s not exactly my name per se . 
"
11790183,6,31,"Huh ($_huh) ? 
"
11790183,6,32,"I got it from a name generator I found on Google , Toshinori ($_toshinori) said , and , if Shouto ($_shouto) heard Momo ($_momo) muffling her ($_toshinori) laughter , he ($_toshinori) ignored it . 
"
11790183,6,33,"Toshinori ($_toshinori) seemed to disappear further into his ($_toshinori) couch cushions , obviously uncomfortable with the conversation s turn . It s been a long time since we last saw each other , but I thought you were old enough to still remember . 
"
11790183,6,34,"I ve never met you a day in my life . 
"
11790183,6,35,"Momo ($_momo) s eyes settled onto Shouto ($_shouto) , her arms crossed over her chest . He ($_momo) s been like this for a while . I suspect someone or something has tampered with his ($_momo) memories . Someone else with purple hair sent by Endeavor . 
"
11790183,6,36,"Shouto ($_shouto) s head spun . His ($_momo) memories were taken ? 
"
11790183,6,37,"Come here , my boy . 
"
11790183,6,38,"Shouto ($_shouto) treaded to Toshinori , his ($_shouto) footfalls heavy with apprehension , and when he ($_shouto) reached his ($_shouto) destination at Toshinori ($_toshinori) s side , Shouto ($_shouto) kneeled beside him ($_shouto) on the floor . Toshinori ($_toshinori) took one of his ($_toshinori) arms in his ($_toshinori) hand , turning it this way and that . Shouto ($_shouto) noted that his ($_shouto) nails were blunt and closely trimmed down to his ($_shouto) nailbed . He ($_shouto) studied Shouto ($_shouto) s hand next , tracing the lines on his ($_shouto) palm and lightly putting pressure on his ($_shouto) bones as he ($_shouto) analyzed one finger at a time . Toshinori ($_toshinori) dropped his ($_toshinori) hand . 
"
11790183,6,39,"Well , I m not sure how you did it , but this is a human body . How you acquired it , I don t know , but now the increase of stress being put on this body is causing you to show your true nature . 
"
11790183,6,40,"True nature ? 
"
11790183,6,41,"You re not exactly human . Toshinori ($_toshinori) s eyes bore into his ($_toshinori) . Well , you re something a bit closer to a deity . 
"
11790183,6,42,"Momo ($_momo) nodded , moving closer to the edge of her seat . A slightly minor deity , she added . 
"
11790183,6,43,"But a deity , all the same . 
"
11790183,6,44,"And Shouto_with_his_widened_eyes ($_with) his ($_with) widened eyes could not help but draw comparisons between himself ($_with) and Izuku ($_izuku) , seeing between them little resemblance in terms of nature or affinity . While Izuku ($_izuku) was a pleasant presence in his ($_with) life , there were times Shouto ($_shouto) was made all too aware of his ($_with) animalistic tendencies , of his ($_with) strong affinity for raw meat , and the thought that he ($_with) was anything remotely similar was concerning . 
"
11790183,6,45,"Shouto ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head . No , that can t be true . Izu my friend my friend would have told me . 
"
11790183,6,46,"Your friend ? Izuku ($_izuku) ? Did he ($_with) say nothing to you about this ? Toshinori ($_toshinori) watched as Shouto ($_shouto) mouthed out a no . That s odd . And how is Izuku ($_izuku) doing ? It ($_izuku) ll be spring in a few weeks . Has he ($_with) had a good hibernation ? 
"
11790183,6,47,"No , Izuku ($_izuku) he ($_with) hasn t woken up . 
"
11790183,6,48,"What? Toshinori ($_toshinori) s eyes , Shouto ($_shouto) noticed , widened . He ($_with) made to sit up , but a fit of coughs forced him ($_with) to continue laying down . He ($_with) covered his ($_with) mouth with the collar of his ($_with) shirt ; when he ($_with) pulled his ($_with) face away , Shouto ($_shouto) could see it was stained with blood . 
"
11790183,6,49,"Are you okay ? 
"
11790183,6,50,"Toshinori ($_toshinori) chuckled . No . In short , I m dying . Or , well , my portion of One For All is steadily flowing back into Izuku ($_izuku) , as he ($_with) is becoming the strongest between the two of us now . A while ago I was badly injured by another youkai s tricks , and now , the forest is probably consuming the surplus energy from Izuku ($_izuku) s body . 
"
11790183,6,51,"Shouto ($_shouto) licked his ($_shouto) lips . But will he ($_shouto) be okay ? 
"
11790183,6,52,"So long as the forest is standing , he ($_shouto) ll live , but to be sure I d have to see him ($_shouto) myself . Toshinori ($_toshinori) hoisted himself ($_shouto) up . The collar of his ($_shouto) shirt slipped down , and Shouto ($_shouto) saw the hard lines of his ($_shouto) bones that were swimming in his ($_shouto) baggy clothes . 
"
11790183,6,53,"Momo ($_momo) stood , eyes kind but alarmed . You re returning to the forest ? 
"
11790183,6,54,"Izuku ($_izuku) said before that the weaker of you two would be reabsorbed into the other . How can you be sure it s safe for you to enter ? 
"
11790183,6,55,"I know I may not look like much in this form , but I m still strong enough to withstand One For All s pull . 
"
11790183,6,56,"Shouto ($_shouto) forced himself ($_shouto) to not show his ($_shouto) uncertainty on his ($_shouto) face . He ($_shouto) stood with unblinking eyes , and , once on his ($_shouto) feet , turned to venture out the way he ($_shouto) came , out the room and down the hallway , through the door . Momo ($_momo) , once he ($_shouto) passed her , transformed into the all too familiar cat and trotted after him ($_shouto) . I don t think I ll ever get used to that . I think I need some air , he ($_shouto) mumbled . 
"
11790183,6,57,"And Toshinori ($_toshinori) nodded sagely . Understandable. I think I ll make the return to Izuku ($_izuku) at some point tonight .

11790183,6,59,"Tall , flamboyantly colored buildings lined their sides . Men and women alike stood outside their respective stores , attempting to attract customers .

"
11790183,6,79,"The newest successor of the Yaoyorozu line maintained a diligent eye over the Todoroki family for nearly fifty years but lived with them for only two . She ($_the) came to them as a kitten , all black and tan with large paws and whiskers she ($_the) had yet to grow into , and the matriarch , Himari , scooped her ($_the) up with an easy smile and gifted her ($_the) the name Momo ($_momo) . 
"
11790183,6,80,"Momo ($_momo) took to her ($_the) position fairly well . The_Todorokis ($_the) were comprised of only two members , Enji , a comic book artist , and his wife , Himari . Their ($_the) lives in the countryside were fairly dull , and hardly any other youkai came around to stir trouble . The most Momo ($_momo) had to deal with was the occasional lesser youkai that would come snooping for food , which Momo ($_momo) did not protest to . They were , after all , harmless to the Todorokis and these were modern times . Despite their proximity to spiritually charged places , most humans were hardly around youkai enough to be able to see them .

And Momo ($_momo) , though she ($_the) had seen human children often enough , had seen Todoroki Enji as an infant , marvelled at the sight of the pale wrinkly thing named Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) . Soon_after_Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) came two others , both male , named Akira ($_akira) and Takashi . Their personalities were all different , but whenever they saw Momo ($_momo) they made to grab at her ($_the) fur with large toothless grins and over-enthused squeals .

11790183,6,82,"When Harumi ($_harumi) was pregnant a fourth time Momo ($_momo) knew before well before her ($_the) charges . But she ($_the) also knew this fetus was different . It was small , weak , and would more than likely not live past a few hours outside the womb . This would be upsetting to the Todorokis , she ($_the) knew , but there was hardly anything Momo ($_momo) could do to prolong the inevitable . On a chilly autumn evening , Harumi ($_harumi) was rushed to the hospital by Enji ($_enji) for fear of a miscarriage , Harumi ($_harumi) scared out of her ($_the) wits and Enji a mess of tears . Momo ($_momo) expected them to return solem and with the urge to seek her ($_the) her ($_the) out to absently bury their fingers in her ($_the) long fur .

When the boy saw her ($_harumi) , he did not move . Only stared at her ($_harumi) with his large eyes before blinking slowly . Odd . It was only when Momo ($_momo) sensed a low hum of energy coming from the baby that she ($_harumi) was able to assess there was a creature inhabiting the child s body . Momo ($_momo) should have discarded Shouto ($_shouto) while he ($_momo) was still small and immobile . It would hardly be difficult to do so , just a freak accident . It was Momo ($_momo) s duty , she ($_harumi) justified .

Her ($_shouto) doctor prescribed her ($_shouto) medication in the form of a cream . Though that would fix the symptom , it would not fix the cause . Harumi ($_harumi) was spirit-bitten , it seemed .
