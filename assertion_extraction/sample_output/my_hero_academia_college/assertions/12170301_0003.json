He ($_iida) can t help but smile at Iida ($_iida) s clearly uptight nature , as he ($_iida) forces him ($_iida) to sit on the horse in case he ($_iida) is more injured than they suspect . Uraraka ($_uraraka) chats incessantly to the two of them as they wander along the path , until she ($_uraraka) stops suddenly , turning her ($_uraraka) head to face Midoriya ($_midoriya) . \n", "You never told us your name ! She ($_uraraka) says , shocked , and bowing her ($_uraraka) head in apology for her ($_uraraka) forgetting . \n", "As you know , I agree , Iida ($_iida) adds .

I m sure my mom knows who he is though , because she always avoids the topic when I bring it up . I just stopped asking after a while . An awkward silence hangs in the air for a while , until Uraraka ($_uraraka) yawns loudly , drawing the two boy s attention to her .", "Hey , Midoriya ($_midoriya) ! She ($_uraraka) asks suddenly , effectively interrupting Iida ($_iida) s story .

Uraraka ($_uraraka) laughs softly to herself ($_uraraka) upon seeing them getting on so well - she ($_uraraka) can tell that asking the green haired boy to join their group was a good idea . He ($_uraraka) seems kind , and genuine , despite his ($_uraraka) initial panic that they were going to attack him ($_uraraka) . In hindsight , this was a fair assumption to make , considering that the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) was often full of people who had managed to get on the wrong side of the law . \n"]}
