{"($_kirishima)": ["Scratching the ridge could only occupy Kirishima ($_kirishima) for so long , and before too long , he ($_bakugo) was withdrawing his ($_bakugo) head , to poke lower on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s body . Kirishima ($_kirishima) forced his ($_kirishima) nose between Bakugo ($_bakugo) s thighs , sniffing . Bakugo ($_bakugo) stumbled back , aiming a quick kick at the dragon . No ! What that fuck ?! Don t stick your face down there ! he ($_bakugo) shrieked . \n", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) flushed as he ($_bakugo) realized what he ($_bakugo) had said . Well. . of course there s going to be a next time you fucking idiot . Kirishima ($_kirishima) made a rumbling sound and bumped his ($_kirishima) nose against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s chest . It stung a bit , but Bakugo ($_bakugo) placed a hand on top of his ($_bakugo) nose , scratching a ridge along the nose that had Kirishima rumbling happily again .", " There was a huffing snort of amusement and Bakugo ($_bakugo) was buffeted by hot air . He tried to stomp over to the dragon head but the amount of pain that shot through him at the heavy footfall made him instead limp over to punch the dragon on the nose . Kirishima ($_kirishima) whimpered . Well maybe control yourself next time and this won t happen ! shouted Bakugo ($_bakugo) again , giving him another punch .", "Trilling eagerly , Kirishima ($_kirishima) darted forward , whole body wiggling like a cat . Bakugo hadn t realized he ($_kirishima) had said his ($_kirishima) thought out loud until it was too late . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tail swept his ($_kirishima) feet out from under him ($_kirishima) and Bakugo ($_bakugo) fell with a thud and was immediately flipped over . There was a strong puff of air from Kirishima ($_kirishima) and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s cape went flying over his ($_bakugo) back to land over his ($_bakugo) head , trapping Bakugo in an even darkened and humid environment . \n", "Or at least he ($_kirishima) thought , but the longer he ($_kirishima) stared at it , the more he ($_kirishima) thought , Oh why the fuck not . \n", " In response , Kirishima ($_kirishima) opened his ($_kirishima) mouth and once again , let his ($_kirishima) tongue roll out . This_time_Bakugo ($_bakugo) was more prepared at the sight , but the scale was a completely different now . It was one thing to let Kirishima ($_kirishima) lick him ($_kirishima) as a human , still weird , but a generally accepted normal thing . But now he ($_kirishima) wanted to lick Bakugo ($_bakugo) with a tongue thicker than his ($_kirishima) leg ? He ($_kirishima) didn t think so .", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) tried to dodge but Kirishima ($_kirishima) s wing stopped him ($_bakugo) from escaping . He ($_bakugo) pounded against the wing . Oh come on! he ($_bakugo) shouted angrily , at no one in particular because Kirishima ($_kirishima) was apparently just toying with him ($_bakugo) now . He ($_bakugo) turned to face said dragon , scowling fiercely , or at least as fiercely as he ($_bakugo) could in his ($_bakugo) disheveled state . What the fuck are you trying to do now ?", " Moaning at the thought , Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hips moved faster , the tongue laving the best it could in-between his ($_bakugo) cheeks . Was Kirishima his ($_bakugo) boyfriend now ? What s the protocol for the type of sexual tension dance they ve been dancing around that month ? Especially considering where it had landed him ($_bakugo) , not that he ($_bakugo) was complaining mind you . But all things considering , it was a complicated relationship . The tip of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tongue tried it 's hardest to wiggle into Bakugo ($_bakugo) s asshole and it didn t take long for Bakugo ($_bakugo) to come again . Kirishima ($_kirishima) eagerly licked it ($_bakugo) up before finishing cleaning his the remaining cum from off of his thighs . The rough tongue caught on his sensitive skin pleasurably but Bakugo ($_bakugo) was just too tired , this day had been the weirdest he s ever had , and he s seen a lot of weird things over the years .", " Bakugo didn t have a chance to say more than some well-placed curse words before Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tongue was on him ($_bakugo) . It licked him ($_bakugo) clear up his ($_bakugo) back , rasping along his ($_bakugo) skin , and sending a shiver down his ($_bakugo) spine . It was rougher the Kirishima s human tongue had been , but the difference in scale had it eliciting a completely different sensation .", "There was the rushing sound of Kirishima 's shift , then silence . It took a minute or so before he ($_bakugo) heard movement again , the soft crunching sound of grass and dead leaves underfoot . He ($_bakugo) felt Kirishima ($_kirishima) kneel down next to him ($_bakugo) , draping a cloth over his ($_bakugo) torso . Bakugo ($_bakugo) opened his ($_bakugo) eyes blearily . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) had dropped an apron on his ($_kirishima) chest . Bakugo ($_bakugo) sighed and sat up . What is this ? \n", " Well , you looked like you needed bandages , your side looks pretty bloodied up there , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said , enthusiasm leaking out of every pore now that Bakugo ($_bakugo) was awake . So I went back to the village and tried to ask for some but they chased me out again . So I took this off a line of clothes as I left . Will it work ? His ($_bakugo) eyes drilled into Bakugo ($_bakugo) , soft , caring , concerned .", "When they ($_kirishima) returned , trolls horns and tusks in hand , the villagers took one look at the bloody dripping handful , and chased them ($_kirishima) out of town . \n", "Sore and dirty , they ($_kirishima) had stopped for the night in a clearing in the same woods , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stretched on the ground , barking out his ($_bakugo) desire to nap off the whole day . Kirishima ($_kirishima) watched him ($_bakugo) silently before going off into the trees . Watching him ($_bakugo) go , Bakugo ($_bakugo) didn t think much of it , and fell into a light doze . \n", "He ($_bakugo) should have realized Kirishima ($_kirishima) was doing something foolish if he ($_bakugo) had been gone this long . \n", "Tilting his ($_bakugo) head , Kirishima ($_kirishima) examined the cloth again .

No shit . But did you have to drop it ? Now it s a mess , he ($_away) said crossly , nudging the carcass with his ($_away) boot . \n", "He ($_bakugo) bucked his ($_bakugo) body up violently , torso colliding with solid warmth as Kirishima ($_kirishima) s dick started to throb noticeably against his ($_bakugo) own . Oh my gods , oh my gods , oh my gods , Bakugo repeatedly helplessly as he ($_bakugo) felt his ($_bakugo) own orgasm approaching again , rising higher and higher like a cliffside he ($_bakugo) was desperate to jump off of . KIRISHIMA ($_kirishima) ! \n", "MINE ($_bakugo) , was the only reply he ($_bakugo) got before Kirishima ($_kirishima) sank his ($_bakugo) teeth into Bakugo ($_bakugo) s shoulder , the shock jerking another orgasm out of him ($_bakugo) , the free fall of pleasure sending him ($_bakugo) tumbling down . He ($_bakugo) faintly registered huffing deep breathing and the repeated use of his ($_bakugo) name in his ($_bakugo) ear as he ($_bakugo) felt himself ($_bakugo) become covered in more and more warm liquid . It slid down his ($_bakugo) body , soaking the furs and being sucked in by his ($_bakugo) clenching ass cheeks . The finger between them had long since stopped it s pumping , now smearing the heady warmth all over his ($_bakugo) lower body . It burned pleasantly , slick and smooth and Bakugo ($_bakugo) closed his ($_bakugo) eyes at the sensation . \n", " The wing almost immediately lifted and a massive dragon head took his ($_bakugo) place . Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked bright and alert , chirping happily at the sight of the disheveled Bakugo . He ($_bakugo) staggered to his ($_bakugo) feet , the legs of his ($_bakugo) pants falling around his ($_bakugo) ankles and he ($_bakugo) kicked them off angrily . You fucking destroyed my pants asshole ! he ($_bakugo) yelled at the dragon , shaking his ($_bakugo) fist .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) hummed , not looking remotely sorry at all . His ($_bakugo) wing came down over Bakugo ($_bakugo) s head , patting his ($_bakugo) hair lightly , wind whooshing all around him ($_bakugo) . \n", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) continued to examine himself ($_bakugo) now that he ($_bakugo) had light . His ($_bakugo) cloak , that he ($_bakugo) was somehow still wearing , was covered in mud , grass stains , all along the bottom . The rest of it was smeared with dried liquids Bakugo didn t want to think too hard about , that would be a bitch to wash out . His ($_bakugo) neck felt tender to the touch but nothing came away messy , same with the cut on his ($_bakugo) side . The point was to heal his ($_bakugo) cut not aggravate it , although somehow it had n't reopened . Maybe Kirishima ($_kirishima) s saliva was magical after all . While examining the healing wound , Bakugo ($_bakugo) noticed he ($_bakugo) had hand shaped bruises on his ($_bakugo) hips , and everything below the waist was covered in crusting , and still sticky fluid .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) trilled in response , looking quite pleased . \n", " Mine , Kirishima said roughly in his ($_bakugo) ear . It didn t even sound like his ($_bakugo) voice anymore , Bakugo ($_bakugo) had been right , it could get deeper . Bakugo_,_fuck ($_bakugo) . MINE . The beastial tone of his ($_bakugo) voice had Bakugo ($_bakugo) moaning Kirishima ($_kirishima) s name in return . That only seemed to spur Kirishima ($_kirishima) on , the hand he ($_bakugo) had been bracing himself ($_bakugo) on slid down his ($_bakugo) back and in-between Bakugo s glistening ass and slipping two fingers down into the cleft . Bakugo ($_bakugo) screamed .", "He ($_bakugo) mostly ended up grumbling , red-faced , while Kirishima ($_kirishima) picked feathers out of his ($_bakugo) hair for him ($_bakugo) , grinning the whole time . \n", "Every morning he ($_kirishima) woke up cold and sore . \n", "Now covered in feathers , Bakugo ($_bakugo) shot to his ($_bakugo) feet and did his ($_bakugo) best to sound irritated at screaming at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . It didn t work much considering he ($_bakugo) had seen the obvious other offerings , a handful of - now bloodied - wildflowers with their roots still attached . \n", "As the days went on , Bakugo ($_bakugo) took to ribbing Kirishima ($_kirishima) about how he ($_kirishima) only seemed to catch deer , taunting him ($_kirishima) about his ($_kirishima) inability for variety . As if to spite him ($_kirishima) , 2 hours later Kirishima ($_kirishima) came back to the camp and dumped an armful of assorted birds directly onto the shivering Bakugo . \n", "Those thoughts included ; Why won t this fucker put on clothes ? It s fucking SNOWING , Oh my gods my feet are going to die of frostbite , He ($_bakugo) is too warm I think I m going to fall asleep next to him ($_bakugo) and he ($_bakugo) will never let me live it down , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s least favorite , If Kirishima ($_kirishima) doesn t put his ($_bakugo) goddamn hands on me right now I m going to die . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to not be phased by anything , if anything he ($_bakugo) got even hotter then he ($_bakugo) had before . Not physically , Bakugo ($_bakugo) wasn t sure that was possible , the dragon seemed to radiate even more heat than usual . Oftentimes , Bakugo ($_bakugo) would find himself ($_bakugo) shivering and instantly Kirishima ($_kirishima) would be standing near him ($_bakugo) before he ($_bakugo) could think to grab another fur . Having his ($_bakugo) own personal furnace seemed like a good idea , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) s adamant desire to expose as much skin as possible while standing nearly looming over him ($_bakugo) added a whole slew of problems into the mix \n", "Every night as Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifted into his ($_kirishima) dragon form , Bakugo ($_bakugo) watched him ($_kirishima) with a mix of envy and irritation . The air around him ($_kirishima) was warm , comforting , and every night the dragon raised a wing , inviting him ($_kirishima) inside . \n", " Whenever Kirishima edged closer to him ($_bakugo) from then on , Bakugo ($_bakugo) made sure to pierce him ($_bakugo) with his ($_bakugo) glare . He ($_bakugo) knew what Kirishima ($_kirishima) was doing , Bakugo ($_bakugo) just refused to speak to him ($_bakugo) about it , saying this sort of thing aloud felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy . There was no way this_fucker ($_bakugo) was going to get him ($_bakugo) to snuggle , Bakugo ($_bakugo) was NOT a hugging person . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to get touchier as the temperature dropped , his ($_kirishima) hands warm on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s shoulders or back . It slowed him ($_kirishima) down , Bakugo ($_bakugo) s entire being relishing the warmth oozing into his ($_kirishima) body . But he ($_kirishima) always pulled away . Despite what Bakugo ($_bakugo) told himself ($_kirishima) day ($_day) after day ($_day) , his ($_kirishima) body still cried out for Kirishima ($_kirishima) s touch until he ($_kirishima) forced it deep , deep down .", " So if you ll have me , I d like to take you , Kirishima ($_kirishima) growled . Kirishima ($_kirishima) set a ruthless pace , his ($_kirishima) hips turning into a rough grind , their hips never leaving contact away from each other for even a second . It tore a shout of , YES , shit yes , from Bakugo ($_bakugo) s throat before that turned into desperate panting for breath . . He ($_kirishima) was pretty sure Kirishima ($_kirishima) was going to burn him ($_kirishima) , his ($_kirishima) skin so hot , his ($_kirishima) dick an inferno .", " He ($_kirishima) needed to touch that skin . Arms shaking , Bakugo ($_bakugo) fought to open his ($_bakugo) belt , fumbling , scratching at the knot that tied them shut . Knot . Oh fuck dragon s dicks had knots . The surge of arousal that shot through him ($_bakugo) at the idea of taking Kirishima ($_kirishima) s knot had him ($_bakugo) struggling for air as he ($_bakugo) forced down his ($_bakugo) impending orgasm .", " Kirishima ($_kirishima) s head jerked up , fingers clenching harder around Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hips . The man in question was looking down at him ($_bakugo) , eyes burning .", " His ($_bakugo) face was beet red , flushed , lips bitten and shiny . If Bakugo ($_bakugo) was about to tell him ($_bakugo) to get off , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was pretty sure he ($_bakugo) would erupt into flames right then and there . His ($_bakugo) skin felt like it was restless , itching and burning , aching to grab the blond and never let him ($_bakugo) back up out of his ($_bakugo) reach . There was only one type of off_Kirishima ($_kirishima) was interested in getting right now .", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) pushed himself ($_bakugo) upright on shaking arms , stopping when he ($_bakugo) was sitting up straight , staring at him ($_bakugo) . In order to maintain eye contact , Kirishima ($_kirishima) drew back and sat up to his ($_bakugo) full height too , causing Bakugo ($_bakugo) to have to now look above his ($_bakugo) eyeline . Bakugo ($_bakugo) glowered at him ($_bakugo) . What do you ($_bakugo) think you ($_bakugo) 're playing at ? \n", " All of a sudden , Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled up , a woosh of cold air returning to fill the unoccupied space . His ($_bakugo) hand resumed its spot on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s waist , gripping him ($_bakugo) tight to lift the entire lower half of his ($_bakugo) body into the air . With one huge hand , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was holding his ($_kirishima) hips and legs 2 feet above the ground easily , muscles not even strained .", " Abruptly , Kirishima ($_kirishima) s arm spread Bakugo ($_bakugo) s legs apart , exposing Bakugo ($_bakugo) shamelessly to his ($_bakugo) gaze . He ($_bakugo) came back down to brace himself ($_bakugo) over Bakugo ($_bakugo) , caging him ($_bakugo) in under his ($_bakugo) body . His ($_bakugo) hips returned to meet Bakugo ($_bakugo) s , drawing out a whine . Kirishima ($_kirishima) what -- '' Bakugo ($_bakugo) tried to say before Kirishima ($_kirishima) ground his ($_bakugo) hips particularly hard against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s and the complaint dissolved into a moan .", " Kirishima ($_kirishima) nearly slammed him ($_bakugo) to the ground at that , only the fur of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s cape keeping his ($_bakugo) back from smashing to the cold floor of the forest . Chills shot up his ($_bakugo) spine with the accompanying sting of his ($_bakugo) injury . Bakugo ($_bakugo) ignored it . It did n't take long for Kirishima ($_kirishima) to climb on top of the smaller man , engulfing him ($_bakugo) with warmth , his ($_bakugo) weight absolutely smothering him ($_bakugo) . Bakugo ($_bakugo) scrambled for a handhold and pulled himself ($_bakugo) closer , letting out a disgracefully needy moan . Fuck , was Kirishima eloquent reply , the words sounding stuck in his ($_bakugo) throat . His ($_bakugo) voice had dropped during their vigorous activities , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) wanted to see how far it would go .", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) groaned at the image that painted in his ($_bakugo) mind of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hips pounding his ($_bakugo) massive dick into him ($_bakugo) , instead of just against him ($_bakugo) . His ($_bakugo) own dick was as hard as a rock at this point , he ($_bakugo) wasn t sure he ($_bakugo) had ever been this hard in his ($_bakugo) goddamn life . \n", "This is how dragons court , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said hoarsely , his ($_bakugo) hips snapping rapidly against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s own . He ($_bakugo) mouthed at the tender skin of Bakugo s neck with his ($_bakugo) teeth . We find the one we want and we dominate them , showing them how much we want to fuck them , how we want to breed them up . \n", "Alright alright , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said , drawing back a little bit to look at the wound closer for the first time . It really wasn t that bad but Kirishima ($_kirishima) could see the irritation on the edges of the puckered skin . It was healing , no open sores he ($_bakugo) was glad to see . He ($_bakugo) wouldn t get sick from licking something like that , but that didn t mean it tasted good . Bakugo ($_bakugo) had indeed kept the wound clean but Kirishima ($_kirishima) had a mission and dammit he ($_bakugo) was going to get his ($_bakugo) tongue on Bakugo ($_bakugo) in any way he ($_bakugo) could . \n", "The first lick was a little sour , but the choked gasp that escaped from Bakugo ($_bakugo) made it worth it . He ($_bakugo) laved his ($_bakugo) tongue over it again , then again , and a third time , losing himself ($_bakugo) in the taste of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s skin . Kirishima ($_kirishima) brought his ($_bakugo) right hand down to grip Bakugo s hip , thumbing over the hip bone jutting out , clenching tight over the skin . His ($_bakugo) nails scratched the skin but if anything , that made Bakugo ($_bakugo) shudder even harder . \n", " What was that? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked teasingly , a nail accidentally scraping down his pec and Bakugo ($_bakugo) gave a full body shudder at that , Kirishima ($_kirishima) readjusting to support his weight . He scooted closer , edging his way in-between Bakugo ($_bakugo) s legs , spreading them wider with his own , ignoring Bakugo ($_bakugo) s grumbles . Leaning closer down , Kirishima ($_kirishima) carefully nosed the hard planes of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s stomach . They twitched , and he exhaled a long breath over them .", " One of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s arms came up to smack him in the head . Stop fucking around , he grumbled , but there was no heat behind the words . If anything , Bakugo ($_bakugo) sounded strained , his ($_bakugo) arm falling back quickly to support his ($_bakugo) body that was stretching further behind him ($_bakugo) . He ($_bakugo) was spread out , chest heaving , waiting for him ($_bakugo) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) had to take a deep breath this time . He ($_bakugo) resettled his ($_bakugo) hands into a position to support Bakugo s weight .", " Chancing another glance up , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was surprised to see Bakugo ($_bakugo) already looking down at him ($_bakugo) past his ($_bakugo) heaving chest , his ($_bakugo) eyes dilated and wide . His ($_bakugo) lip was pulled tight into his ($_bakugo) mouth with teeth biting down on the fullness , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) vividly felt his ($_bakugo) body scream out in response . Gods he ($_bakugo) wished that was him ($_bakugo) . In response , he ($_bakugo) sucked his ($_bakugo) hip bone into his ($_bakugo) mouth sloppily , sucking sharply on the protrusion . A keening sound escaped Bakugo in surprise , hips jerking up , digging Kirishima s teeth in past the flesh . That only made him ($_bakugo) shudder even more and Kirishima ($_kirishima) deepened the bite as fire shot through his ($_bakugo) own bones . Releasing his ($_bakugo) jaw after a moment , Kirishima ($_kirishima) licked gently over the fresh pinpricks of blood .", " A quick look up made Kirishima ($_kirishima) groan at the sight of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s flushed face , his ($_bakugo) eyes and lips clenched shut . He ($_bakugo) doubled his ($_bakugo) efforts , tongue pressing probably harder than he ($_bakugo) should have , spreading his ($_bakugo) tongue flat , letting himself ($_bakugo) drool over his ($_bakugo) skin . If he ($_bakugo) was covering an area wider than the wound now , he ($_bakugo) mentally told himself ($_bakugo) it was better safe than sorry . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s skin was smooth , only disturbed by the occasional scar , ones Kirishima ($_kirishima) was more than glad to lick over . He ($_bakugo) started to make his ($_bakugo) way over them as well , tongue slobbering , occasionally letting his ($_bakugo) sharp teeth drag . Dizzily , Kirishima ($_kirishima) wondered if Bakugo ($_bakugo) excreted some sort of addicting substance to make him ($_bakugo) press this far , knowing how the other male felt about his ($_bakugo) advances . Kirishima ($_kirishima) decided it did n't matter , the breathy gasps that occasionally got through Bakugo ($_bakugo) s flushed lips were the softest things he ($_bakugo) had ever heard from Bakugo ($_bakugo) .", " As a dragon , Kirishima ($_kirishima) didn t need clothes , but when he ($_kirishima) shifted into a human form , he ($_kirishima) just paraded around naked until Bakugo ($_bakugo) screamed enough at him ($_kirishima) . The_dragon_man_still_didn_t ($_kirishima) understand why clothing was so important , being far more comfortable without it . He ($_kirishima) had lived his ($_kirishima) whole life as a dragon without them , why change now ? And of course he ($_kirishima) was confident , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was practically sculpted .", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) was far less comfortable with it , he ($_kirishima) didn t need Kirishima s bulked up muscles parading around on display all the time . He ($_kirishima) definitely was not getting distracted by the_other_man ($_kirishima) . Not at all .", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) was not prepared for the sheer size of whatever that THING was in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s pants . I mean , obviously it was his ($_bakugo) dick but holy fuck , that thing felt like an extra fucking limb .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) was now pretty sure he ($_kirishima) has been on track all along . The lump in Bakugo ($_bakugo) s pants he ($_kirishima) was seen earlier was now flush against his ($_kirishima) hips , and he ($_kirishima) was pretty damn sure he ($_kirishima) understood that aspect of human behavior . \n", "No , no this is n't , Bakugo ($_bakugo) confirmed . He ($_bakugo) finally looked up at Kirishima ($_kirishima) and the confident smirk was back that Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew and loved was back . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) was pretty lost on what was happening now , but the wandering that Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hands were doing across his ($_bakugo) shoulders was very encouraging . What else is something that friends do n't do ? he ($_bakugo) asked . He ($_bakugo) licked his ($_bakugo) lips nervously , watching with pride that Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes followed the movement . In response , Bakugo ($_bakugo) fully pressed their hips together . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hands palmed Kirishima ($_kirishima) s back , clenching around the thick muscles . His ($_bakugo) voice caught in his ($_bakugo) throat as he ($_bakugo) squeezed . You -- You 're just so fucking HOT_,_Bakugo ($_bakugo) admitted . \n", " With a sigh of relief , Kirishima ($_kirishima) buried his ($_kirishima) face into the curve is Bakugo s shoulder and neck , sliding his ($_kirishima) unoccupied hand into soft , soft hair . He ($_kirishima) pulled sharply , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s head went easily back , baring his ($_kirishima) neck in a sinful arch . Kirishima ($_kirishima) wasted no time in sucking in any exposed skin into his ($_kirishima) mouth , mindful of his ($_kirishima) teeth . Bakugo ($_bakugo) let out a deep groan and Kirishima ($_kirishima) responded in kind , louder , more guttural as he ($_kirishima) sucked and nibbled his ($_kirishima) way across the exposed skin . He ($_kirishima) breathed in deeply and rolled his ($_kirishima) muscles forward as he ($_kirishima) felt Bakugo ($_bakugo) shift as well , his ($_kirishima) hands clutching at his ($_kirishima) shoulders . I thought you were never going to let me in , Kirishima ($_kirishima) admitted , voice rough .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) towered over Bakugo ($_bakugo) , having a good 2 feet on the average male . He ($_bakugo) was a solid wall of muscle , rippling pectorals , a jawline sculpted by god himself ($_bakugo) . Or perhaps the devil himself ($_bakugo) because Bakugo ($_bakugo) was surely going to hell for the thoughts running through his ($_bakugo) mind right now as he ($_bakugo) stared openly . The light from the campfire set Kirishima 's rough skin aglow , creating a soft halo around the_man ($_bakugo) . His ($_bakugo) long hair was down , cascading down his ($_bakugo) shoulders in whisps , catching the dying light , lighting up like the sunset Bakugo ($_bakugo) could no longer see without associating with Kirishima ($_kirishima) . His ($_bakugo) eyes dragged over his ($_bakugo) neck and jaw , hesitating at his ($_bakugo) lips and snarling teeth , before looking Kirishima in the eyes . \n", "Hey! Kirishima ($_kirishima) protested , immediately getting to his ($_kirishima) feet to grab the cloth . He ($_kirishima) gathered it in his ($_kirishima) hands , face falling into a pout . \n", "Tsking angrily , Bakugo ($_bakugo) snatched it out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands and threw it further away from them . Yeah but it s dirty ! You can t cover something in dead animal blood then expect me to fucking dress a wound with it idiot ! \n", "Faster then he ($_bakugo) could process , Kirishima ($_kirishima) jumped over to him ($_bakugo) , twisting his ($_bakugo) wrist back behind him ($_bakugo) , forcing him ($_bakugo) to stop . A deep guttural growl rumbled out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s throat , making his ($_bakugo) next words come out deeper than usual . Don t you dare , I hunted it , I cook it . \n", "If possible Kirishima 's face looked downright distraught at his ($_kirishima) words . You literally just told me not to get blood on clothes and now you re telling me to put on clothes ? I have to get dinner started ! \n", "Their journey continued but at a slower pace . Kirishima ($_kirishima) constantly pestered him ($_bakugo) to take it easy , to have a doctor look at his ($_bakugo) wound , worry etched onto his ($_bakugo) face . Often times Kirishima ($_kirishima) would start to crowd him ($_bakugo) in close , hands grabbing at the small of his ($_bakugo) back before Bakugo ($_bakugo) would pull away roughly . It made Bakugo ($_bakugo) too dizzy . \n", "You need to get that looked at , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said one evening as they sat eating the last of the bird meat . \n", " For the last fucking time , no , I m not paying some quack to tell me how to clean a wound . It s fine , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said wearily for what must have been the fifth time . Seriously , Kirishima ($_kirishima) expected him to drop dead of something over a scratch ? No matter how much it did actually feel like it was burning , Bakugo ($_bakugo) would rather jump in the river then admit that to Kirishima . He ($_bakugo) bit the rest of the meat from the bird violently , throwing the bones into the fire . The remaining fat sizzled loudly in the stillness .", "The look that Kirishima ($_kirishima) gave him ($_bakugo) was thoughtful . Could I look at it then ? \n", "Could I check it out ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) repeated , his ($_bakugo) eyes earnest and shining . I know some basic healing . \n", "Squinting his ($_bakugo) eyes suspiciously , Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked him ($_bakugo) over . He ($_bakugo) had never really seen Kirishima ($_kirishima) get injured so he ($_bakugo) wasn t sure sort of healing he ($_bakugo) could use . Plus he ($_bakugo) had no possessions , what would he ($_bakugo) use to do it ? He ($_bakugo) voiced that to his ($_bakugo) companion , who to his ($_bakugo) surprise , looked sheepish . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) gave him ($_bakugo) an unimpressed stare until Kirishima ($_kirishima) elaborated . I uh , I can heal some minor infections and cuts and stuff like that though uh -- through the dragon stuff , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said , his ($_kirishima) face beginning to color . \n", "In a way of answering , Kirishima ($_kirishima) just opened his ($_kirishima) mouth and let his ($_kirishima) tongue flop out . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes nearly fell out of his ($_kirishima) head . The appendage was way too long to be normal , hanging out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s mouth until it passed his ($_kirishima) chin , glistening with spit . \n", "It s a deer ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) chirped excitedly , phasing easily out of his ($_kirishima) dragon form to approach his ($_kirishima) partner . \n", "Is this something normal human friends do ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked lowly . \n", " You ($_bakugo) dumbass , those are all normal things people do for each other , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said when he ($_bakugo) could speak . I thought you ($_bakugo) were just being helpful . Annoying , but helpful . He ($_bakugo) released the hand from over his ($_bakugo) own mouth and placed it flat on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest to join his ($_bakugo) other hand , long since released from its fist . The moist warmth sent a hot wave of arousal through Kirishima ($_kirishima) , one that only grew stronger when Bakugo ($_bakugo) pressed his ($_bakugo) legs closer around Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hips .", "This ($_bakugo) is n't a game , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said softly . \n", " That seemed to take Bakugo ($_bakugo) by surprise . Gifts ? You ($_bakugo) mean the fucking flowers ? he ($_kirishima) asked incredulously . How am I supposed to tell anything from that ?", "Belatedly , Kirishima ($_kirishima) realizes his ($_kirishima) hands were still gripping Bakugo ($_bakugo) s body . He ($_kirishima) palmed over the skin , clenching tighter using the leverage to pull Bakugo ($_bakugo) closer to his ($_kirishima) chest . The feeling of their bare skin finally meeting made Kirishima ($_kirishima) rumble with pleasure . I thought I 've made my intentions clear . Have you ($_bakugo) not been accepting my gifts ? \n", "Did n't know what you ($_bakugo) shitty lizard ?! Bakugo ($_bakugo) asked crossly . He ($_bakugo) slammed his ($_bakugo) fist into Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest in a futile attempt at violence . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) blinked in surprise . Wait , you ($_bakugo) did n't know ? \n", " There was a tense silence as Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked down and away from him ($_bakugo) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was starting to feel nervous and pulled back from the other male when Bakugo ($_bakugo) started to shake in his ($_bakugo) arms , hand pressed up against his ($_bakugo) face . Soon , his ($_bakugo) muffled laughter was heard , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt that sharp stab of shame again . He ($_bakugo) must have gotten misinformation about human courting ; what had he ($_bakugo) done wrong ? It was similar enough to how he ($_bakugo) was taught to do it but Bakugo ($_bakugo) was n't a dragon . Dragon courting was . different.", " I 've been courting you ($_bakugo) , Kirishima ($_kirishima) admitted . The flood of arousal was starting to leak away and was replaced with the sharp ache of embarrassment . He ($_bakugo) did n't know ?", " Bringing you ($_bakugo) fresh food and cooking it , tending to your ($_bakugo) wounds , expressing care over your ($_bakugo) state of being ; is that not how humans show their affection ? You ($_bakugo) do n't seem to like physical contact , but you ($_bakugo) liked the food and I think the flowers ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) hesitated again to look down at Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Did you ($_bakugo) ?", " Unphased by both the screaming and the violence , Kirishima ($_kirishima) approached the deer and hefted it to his ($_kirishima) shoulder , Bakugo unintentionally getting a front seat view of his ($_kirishima) well muscled ass . Not that he ($_kirishima) was looking , he ($_kirishima) reminded himself ($_kirishima) . As Kirishima ($_kirishima) righted himself ($_kirishima) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) had to intake a short breath . The blood trickled down Kirishima ($_kirishima) s body , running in red lines down the hard lines of his ($_kirishima) muscles , smearing as the limp legs of the deer moved . Well , either way , it s dinner . Is that good ? Do you like it ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) said earnestly .", "Growling , Bakugo ($_bakugo) snapped his ($_bakugo) gaze back up and punched the_man ($_kirishima) s arm . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s smile didn t even budge , his ($_bakugo) skin firm , the dumbass probably didn t even feel it ($_kirishima) . IT S NOT TENDERIZED , IT S OBLIVIATED ! \n", "The blood had trailed down Kirishima ($_kirishima) s pecs and down across his ($_kirishima) abs , and down further south . Bakugo ($_bakugo) eyed him ($_kirishima) unabashed before ripping his ($_kirishima) eyes back up to Kirishima ($_kirishima) s when he ($_kirishima) spoke . Their eyes met and something flickered there before Bakugo ($_bakugo) turned back to the fire , grunting . It s fine , just cook it . He ($_kirishima) could almost feel Kirishima ($_kirishima) s answering grin on his ($_kirishima) skin so he ($_kirishima) snapped . Then go jump in a river you re disgusting . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) dropped the meat from the sky again , the THUMP rattling their minimalist campsite . Bakugo didn t even look up from where he ($_bakugo) was laying , arms crossed behind his ($_bakugo) head . He ($_bakugo) had been TRYING to take a nap , trying to use the time Kirishima ($_kirishima) was gone so it was finally quiet to catch up on some well deserved sleep . \n", "The troll put up a pretty good fight , his large spiked club flying through the air with ease , putting Bakugo ($_bakugo) more on guard as he had to dodge the surprisingly fast movement of something so heavy . However , the troll managed to catch Bakugo ($_bakugo) enough to slam him in the side , sending him flying to the rock wall . There was a booming roar as Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifted to his full form , ruby scaled dragon that towered over the troll . It stood absolutely no chance . All it took was one stream of flame and the troll was toasted . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s heavy foot crushing the troll s head was probably just an extra precaution . \n", " His ($_bakugo) thought process was brought to an immediate halt as Kirishima ($_kirishima) slammed back down , bringing their hips together with a lewd smack . The feeling of the hot and wet slide of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s dick against his ($_bakugo) own , Bakugo ($_bakugo) came almost immediately , screaming loudly . He ($_bakugo) spasmed , jerking in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s iron grip as he ($_bakugo) rode out the most intense orgasm of his ($_bakugo) life as Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to thrust . Kirishima didn t even seem to notice , grunting into Bakugo ($_bakugo) s neck , the breath he ($_bakugo) was exhaling so hot it almost scalding Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes felt like they were going to roll up in the back of his ($_bakugo) head the combined pleasure was so intense . He ($_bakugo) was still hard even though he ($_bakugo) could feel the squelching of his ($_bakugo) cum mixing with whatever Kirishima ($_kirishima) s dick was excreting , rubbing all over his ($_bakugo) hips and dripping over . It dribbled down his ($_bakugo) ass crack and he ($_bakugo) moaned again , head throwing back as he ($_bakugo) clutched desperately to Kirishima .", " Grunting , Kirishima ($_kirishima) leaned up to rip Bakugo ($_bakugo) s pants away , the waistline shredding and with another tug , they bore no resemblance to pants anymore . The remaining fabric on his legs was holding on by sheer will and the clenching Bakugo ($_bakugo) s thigh muscles around Kirishima ($_kirishima) s waist . Briefly , Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt a rush of anger for the loss of his ($_bakugo) favorite pair of pants , but that passed a lot quicker than he ($_bakugo) was proud of . With another rip , Kirishima ($_kirishima) ripped a hole in the front of his ($_bakugo) own pants , and a dick nearly the size of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s forearm came bobbing out , glistening wet in the light . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s mouth went immediately dry at the sight and he ($_bakugo) was sure he ($_bakugo) would never be able to let Kirishima ($_kirishima) walk around naked around him ($_bakugo) again . The thing had nearly doubled in size and looked more like an actual dragons dick then human dick like it had before . What the fuck had happened ?", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) s laugh sounded like bells and Bakugo ($_bakugo) couldn t even find himself to be angry . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) was pretty sure Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew what was happening , he ($_bakugo) looked far too smug with himself ($_bakugo) . When he ($_bakugo) handed over dinner that night , Bakugo ($_bakugo) nearly dropped his ($_bakugo) skewered fish when Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand closed over his ($_bakugo) in the transaction . Even after throwing a half-hearted fit , Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to watch him ($_bakugo) , slowly eating his ($_bakugo) own meal . Bakugo ($_bakugo) wanted to punch him ($_bakugo) in his ($_bakugo) stupid kissable face . \n", "That of course , was nothing compared to when Kirishima ($_kirishima) was actually near him ($_bakugo) . \n", "Now that he ($_bakugo) was aware of the electric feeling running through him ($_bakugo) when he ($_bakugo) was near Kirishima ($_kirishima) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) could never relax . It seemed to follow him ($_bakugo) everywhere , no matter if he ($_bakugo) was with the dragon or not . \n", "Ignoring the soft calls of his ($_bakugo) name , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stalked away to sit in a huff , back to the fire . Turning his ($_bakugo) back pointedly so he ($_bakugo) wouldn t have to face Kirishima ($_kirishima) , or to pointedly ignore the way every fiber of his ($_bakugo) being was telling him ($_bakugo) to turn back around and press himself ($_bakugo) closer . \n", "The grip tightened on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s wrist and he ($_bakugo) gasped involuntarily . The sound sent ripples across Kirishima ($_kirishima) s shoulders and his ($_bakugo) eyes turned smoldering . The air seemed to waver between them and Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt warm , heat radiating from him ($_bakugo) . Let go of me idiot , he ($_bakugo) said , his ($_bakugo) voice barely a whisper . \n", "A rumble echoed out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest again and it ($_kirishima) seemed to snap Kirishima ($_kirishima) out of whatever trance he ($_bakugo) had been in . His ($_bakugo) hand slackened immediately and Bakugo ($_bakugo) ripped himself ($_bakugo) from the hold on his ($_bakugo) wrist , backing away . Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to stand there , looking at Bakugo ($_bakugo) as if he ($_bakugo) was seeing him ($_bakugo) for the first time . Bakugo ($_bakugo) he ($_bakugo) said under his ($_bakugo) breath , Bakugo_barely_hearing_it ($_bakugo) . \n", "After the whoosh of air that followed Kirishima ($_kirishima) s soaring wings , there was a loud THUMP on the other side of the camp that had Bakugo whirling around , defenses up . There was a bloodied corpse and he ($_bakugo) approached it cautiously . \n", "It s tenderized now ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) said cheerfully . \n", "Is that what humans call it ? A boyfriend ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked curiously . \n", " Yeah , Bakugo ($_bakugo) grunted . It sure fucking did . Gently , Kirishima ($_kirishima) set down Bakugo ($_bakugo) onto his ($_bakugo) feet and removed the thoroughly soiled cape from around his ($_bakugo) shoulders . It was promptly replaced with a blood red cloak , the dragon wrapping him ($_bakugo) snugly in the length of cloth . Did you steal this one too ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) grumbled .", "Maybe , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said cheekily . I have to provide for my mate . \n", " His ($_bakugo) groan dragged out until it crescendoed into a shout , then a scream . Kirishima ($_kirishima) just held him ($_bakugo) tightly as he ($_bakugo) screamed himself ($_bakugo) hoarse , then settled back , panting . Did that . help?", "Drowsily , he registered being turned over , and he looked up at the worried dragon head peering over at him . I m fine but if you could just , chill the fuck out for 5 minutes , that d be great , Bakugo ($_bakugo) mumbled , waving a hand dismissively . Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled and backed off . \n", " There was the sound of crunching and shifting and moments later , and the human version of Kirishima ($_kirishima) came trotting back . He kneeled down and lifted Bakugo ($_bakugo) up into his arms easily . Oh shit I m sorry , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said earnestly , but from the looks of his beaming grin , he wasn t sorry one bit .", " Kirishima ($_kirishima) wrapped his ($_kirishima) arms around Bakugo ($_bakugo) and bent down to nuzzle to top of his ($_kirishima) hair . We can do whatever you want to . Boyfriend , mate , whatever works , he ($_kirishima) said contentedly , but Bakugo ($_bakugo) could tell how pleased he ($_kirishima) was . They d figure it out , they had time . His ($_kirishima) cheek squished against Kirishima ($_kirishima) s bare chest , soaking in the warmth and the steady sound of his ($_kirishima) heartbeat .", " Dragons must show affection differently , Bakugo ($_bakugo) would have to teach Kirishima ($_kirishima) to kiss , he ($_kirishima) thought absentmindedly , playing with the hem of his ($_kirishima) new coat . Though handling that tongue and those sharp teeth was going to be a whole other kind of adventure . Bakugo ($_bakugo) sighed deeply , and then smirked as he ($_bakugo) watched goosebumps form on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s skin in response .", " Bringing his ($_bakugo) hands up , Kirishima ($_kirishima) easily moved Bakugo ($_bakugo) s arms apart and his ($_bakugo) palms slid up his ($_bakugo) arms slowly to brush the thick cape out of the way and over his ($_bakugo) shoulders . Bakugo ($_bakugo) shuddered at the feeling , moving his ($_bakugo) arms down to clutch at the rough scaley , wood beneath him ($_bakugo) to steady himself ($_bakugo) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands were so big . So warm. So rough. Bakugos thoughts ran disjointed through his ($_bakugo) head as Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands ran back down his ($_bakugo) chest . Cold ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked quietly as Bakugo ($_bakugo) shuddered again .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled and at this close , Bakugo ($_bakugo) could hear it rumble , pinpricks of heat dotting his ($_bakugo) skin . Finally , he ($_bakugo) said easily and shifted so that he ($_bakugo) was kneeling in front of the sitting Bakugo . \n", "Basically , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said solemnly , stood up and came to crouch in front of where Bakugo ($_bakugo) sat on a fallen log . Are you cool with that ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) stubbornly ignored his ($_bakugo) body s instinct to shy backward . He ($_bakugo) had never been more glad in his ($_bakugo) life that the colder weather had convinced Kirishima ($_kirishima) to at least put on some pants and a sad excuse for a vest that covered nothing . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes flickered on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s crouching thighs , then erect nipples before up to his ($_bakugo) face where Kirishima ($_kirishima) s expression told him ($_bakugo) he ($_bakugo) had not been subtle enough . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) smirked around his ($_bakugo) lolling tongue and Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt a shot of arousal straight down to his ($_bakugo) dick . The tongue flexed and Bakugo ($_bakugo) was pretty sure he ($_bakugo) must look like an idiot right now as he ($_bakugo) just oogled Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tongue . Thankfully for his ($_bakugo) dignity , Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled it back into his ($_bakugo) mouth to reply , My saliva can clean minor wounds . \n", " Not that Bakugo ($_bakugo) was much better off . Hypocrite , he ($_kirishima) said softly , spending most of his ($_kirishima) current thought process fighting with his ($_kirishima) body to buck into the hands that were basically groping over his ($_kirishima) chest now . With every drag of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands , Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt like his ($_kirishima) head was swimming . He ($_kirishima) had never experienced such a feeling , the new sensation of calloused skin across his ($_kirishima) chest had both his ($_kirishima) heart and his ($_kirishima) arms shaking . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s dick throbbed in his ($_bakugo) pants as with a deep breath , his ($_bakugo) lungs expanded , raising his ($_bakugo) chest closer to Kirishima s touch .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands grabbed the sides of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s torso , the bones of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s rib cage shifting under his ($_bakugo) pale skin . He ($_bakugo) rubbed him ($_bakugo) slowly , the warmth of his ($_bakugo) hands spreading across Bakugo ($_bakugo) s chest . After a pause , his ($_bakugo) hands shifted , thumbs extended just enough to catch on Bakugo s nipples , brushing on them gently . You sure about that ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked , his ($_kirishima) voice slightly breathless . \n"], "($_bakugo)": ["Scratching the ridge could only occupy Kirishima ($_kirishima) for so long , and before too long , he ($_bakugo) was withdrawing his ($_bakugo) head , to poke lower on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s body . Kirishima ($_kirishima) forced his ($_kirishima) nose between Bakugo ($_bakugo) s thighs , sniffing . Bakugo ($_bakugo) stumbled back , aiming a quick kick at the dragon . No ! What that fuck ?! Don t stick your face down there ! he ($_bakugo) shrieked . \n", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) flushed as he ($_bakugo) realized what he ($_bakugo) had said . Well. . of course there s going to be a next time you fucking idiot . Kirishima ($_kirishima) made a rumbling sound and bumped his ($_kirishima) nose against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s chest . It stung a bit , but Bakugo ($_bakugo) placed a hand on top of his ($_bakugo) nose , scratching a ridge along the nose that had Kirishima rumbling happily again .", " There was a huffing snort of amusement and Bakugo ($_bakugo) was buffeted by hot air . He tried to stomp over to the dragon head but the amount of pain that shot through him at the heavy footfall made him instead limp over to punch the dragon on the nose . Kirishima ($_kirishima) whimpered . Well maybe control yourself next time and this won t happen ! shouted Bakugo ($_bakugo) again , giving him another punch .", "Trilling eagerly , Kirishima ($_kirishima) darted forward , whole body wiggling like a cat . Bakugo hadn t realized he ($_kirishima) had said his ($_kirishima) thought out loud until it was too late . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tail swept his ($_kirishima) feet out from under him ($_kirishima) and Bakugo ($_bakugo) fell with a thud and was immediately flipped over . There was a strong puff of air from Kirishima ($_kirishima) and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s cape went flying over his ($_bakugo) back to land over his ($_bakugo) head , trapping Bakugo in an even darkened and humid environment . \n", " In response , Kirishima ($_kirishima) opened his ($_kirishima) mouth and once again , let his ($_kirishima) tongue roll out . This_time_Bakugo ($_bakugo) was more prepared at the sight , but the scale was a completely different now . It was one thing to let Kirishima ($_kirishima) lick him ($_kirishima) as a human , still weird , but a generally accepted normal thing . But now he ($_kirishima) wanted to lick Bakugo ($_bakugo) with a tongue thicker than his ($_kirishima) leg ? He ($_kirishima) didn t think so .", " Kirishima wasn t deterred by the blows and pushed harder , sending bursts of hot air down his ($_bakugo) legs as he ($_bakugo) breathed . That s disgusting , no !", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) tried to dodge but Kirishima ($_kirishima) s wing stopped him ($_bakugo) from escaping . He ($_bakugo) pounded against the wing . Oh come on! he ($_bakugo) shouted angrily , at no one in particular because Kirishima ($_kirishima) was apparently just toying with him ($_bakugo) now . He ($_bakugo) turned to face said dragon , scowling fiercely , or at least as fiercely as he ($_bakugo) could in his ($_bakugo) disheveled state . What the fuck are you trying to do now ?", " Moaning at the thought , Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hips moved faster , the tongue laving the best it could in-between his ($_bakugo) cheeks . Was Kirishima his ($_bakugo) boyfriend now ? What s the protocol for the type of sexual tension dance they ve been dancing around that month ? Especially considering where it had landed him ($_bakugo) , not that he ($_bakugo) was complaining mind you . But all things considering , it was a complicated relationship . The tip of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tongue tried it 's hardest to wiggle into Bakugo ($_bakugo) s asshole and it didn t take long for Bakugo ($_bakugo) to come again . Kirishima ($_kirishima) eagerly licked it ($_bakugo) up before finishing cleaning his the remaining cum from off of his thighs . The rough tongue caught on his sensitive skin pleasurably but Bakugo ($_bakugo) was just too tired , this day had been the weirdest he s ever had , and he s seen a lot of weird things over the years .", " Bakugo didn t have a chance to say more than some well-placed curse words before Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tongue was on him ($_bakugo) . It licked him ($_bakugo) clear up his ($_bakugo) back , rasping along his ($_bakugo) skin , and sending a shiver down his ($_bakugo) spine . It was rougher the Kirishima s human tongue had been , but the difference in scale had it eliciting a completely different sensation .", " Sliding back down , it dove between his ($_bakugo) legs , bracketed by Bakugo s thighs .", " The sensation was until anything_Bakugo ($_bakugo) would have expected , burning hot and slick , the tongue pumped back and forth along the gap . Despite having just had the most amazing orgasms of his ($_bakugo) life just earlier that day , Bakugo ($_bakugo) could feel himself ($_bakugo) stirring , roused back from the dead by the slick heat . He ($_bakugo) moaned and pushed his ($_bakugo) dick back against it . Who needs shame when it felt this good to just let your dragon boyfriend eat your ass ?", "There was the rushing sound of Kirishima 's shift , then silence . It took a minute or so before he ($_bakugo) heard movement again , the soft crunching sound of grass and dead leaves underfoot . He ($_bakugo) felt Kirishima ($_kirishima) kneel down next to him ($_bakugo) , draping a cloth over his ($_bakugo) torso . Bakugo ($_bakugo) opened his ($_bakugo) eyes blearily . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) had dropped an apron on his ($_kirishima) chest . Bakugo ($_bakugo) sighed and sat up . What is this ? \n", " Well , you looked like you needed bandages , your side looks pretty bloodied up there , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said , enthusiasm leaking out of every pore now that Bakugo ($_bakugo) was awake . So I went back to the village and tried to ask for some but they chased me out again . So I took this off a line of clothes as I left . Will it work ? His ($_bakugo) eyes drilled into Bakugo ($_bakugo) , soft , caring , concerned .", "It s an apron , you wear it when you re cooking , Bakugo ($_bakugo) explained , tossing it to the ground . How would that help me ? \n", "Sore and dirty , they ($_kirishima) had stopped for the night in a clearing in the same woods , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stretched on the ground , barking out his ($_bakugo) desire to nap off the whole day . Kirishima ($_kirishima) watched him ($_bakugo) silently before going off into the trees . Watching him ($_bakugo) go , Bakugo ($_bakugo) didn t think much of it , and fell into a light doze . \n", "He ($_bakugo) should have realized Kirishima ($_kirishima) was doing something foolish if he ($_bakugo) had been gone this long . \n", "Tilting his ($_bakugo) head , Kirishima ($_kirishima) examined the cloth again . I mean , can t you make bandages out of it ? \n", "The first time it happened , Bakugo ($_bakugo) just thought Kirishima ($_kirishima) was trying to be useful . \n", "He ($_bakugo) bucked his ($_bakugo) body up violently , torso colliding with solid warmth as Kirishima ($_kirishima) s dick started to throb noticeably against his ($_bakugo) own .

KIRISHIMA ($_kirishima) ! \n", "MINE ($_bakugo) , was the only reply he ($_bakugo) got before Kirishima ($_kirishima) sank his ($_bakugo) teeth into Bakugo ($_bakugo) s shoulder , the shock jerking another orgasm out of him ($_bakugo) , the free fall of pleasure sending him ($_bakugo) tumbling down . He ($_bakugo) faintly registered huffing deep breathing and the repeated use of his ($_bakugo) name in his ($_bakugo) ear as he ($_bakugo) felt himself ($_bakugo) become covered in more and more warm liquid . It slid down his ($_bakugo) body , soaking the furs and being sucked in by his ($_bakugo) clenching ass cheeks . The finger between them had long since stopped it s pumping , now smearing the heady warmth all over his ($_bakugo) lower body . It burned pleasantly , slick and smooth and Bakugo ($_bakugo) closed his ($_bakugo) eyes at the sensation . \n", "The next time he ($_bakugo) opened them , he ($_bakugo) was surrounded completely by warmth , red as far as he ($_bakugo) could see . \n", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) s body ached like he ($_bakugo) had just been thrown into a brick wall , but he ($_bakugo) couldn t remember that happening . It was something good that happened , not a bad thing like a lost fight .", " There was a warm fuzz around his ($_bakugo) memories , feeling hazy and comfortable . He ($_bakugo) closed his ($_bakugo) eyes and sank back against the warm scales , nuzzling them slightly in his ($_bakugo) contented state . Wait , scales ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) shot back up , clutching his ($_bakugo) head at the sudden onslaught of dizziness . He ($_bakugo) looked around and indeed , it seemed that he ($_bakugo) was curled up , mostly naked , under the wing of a certain red dragon .", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked down at what he ($_bakugo) could see of his ($_bakugo) shredded pants and sighed . He ($_bakugo) slammed a fist down onto the scales beneath him ($_bakugo) and shouted . Hey! Shitstain ! Let me up ! \n", " The wing almost immediately lifted and a massive dragon head took his ($_bakugo) place . Kirishima ($_kirishima) looked bright and alert , chirping happily at the sight of the disheveled Bakugo . He ($_bakugo) staggered to his ($_bakugo) feet , the legs of his ($_bakugo) pants falling around his ($_bakugo) ankles and he ($_bakugo) kicked them off angrily . You fucking destroyed my pants asshole ! he ($_bakugo) yelled at the dragon , shaking his ($_bakugo) fist .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) hummed , not looking remotely sorry at all .

His ($_bakugo) cloak , that he ($_bakugo) was somehow still wearing , was covered in mud , grass stains , all along the bottom . The rest of it was smeared with dried liquids Bakugo didn t want to think too hard about , that would be a bitch to wash out . His ($_bakugo) neck felt tender to the touch but nothing came away messy , same with the cut on his ($_bakugo) side . The point was to heal his ($_bakugo) cut not aggravate it , although somehow it had n't reopened . Maybe Kirishima ($_kirishima) s saliva was magical after all . While examining the healing wound , Bakugo ($_bakugo) noticed he ($_bakugo) had hand shaped bruises on his ($_bakugo) hips , and everything below the waist was covered in crusting , and still sticky fluid .", "Really? he ($_bakugo) asked deadpan , giving a very unimpressed look at the dragon . \n", "Of course you re fine you re not the one who can t unstick his ass cheeks ! shouted Bakugo ($_bakugo) . \n", " Mine , Kirishima said roughly in his ($_bakugo) ear . It didn t even sound like his ($_bakugo) voice anymore , Bakugo ($_bakugo) had been right , it could get deeper . Bakugo_,_fuck ($_bakugo) . MINE . The beastial tone of his ($_bakugo) voice had Bakugo ($_bakugo) moaning Kirishima ($_kirishima) s name in return . That only seemed to spur Kirishima ($_kirishima) on , the hand he ($_bakugo) had been bracing himself ($_bakugo) on slid down his ($_bakugo) back and in-between Bakugo s glistening ass and slipping two fingers down into the cleft .

It didn t work much considering he ($_bakugo) had seen the obvious other offerings , a handful of - now bloodied - wildflowers with their roots still attached . \n", "As the days went on , Bakugo ($_bakugo) took to ribbing Kirishima ($_kirishima) about how he ($_kirishima) only seemed to catch deer , taunting him ($_kirishima) about his ($_kirishima) inability for variety . As if to spite him ($_kirishima) , 2 hours later Kirishima ($_kirishima) came back to the camp and dumped an armful of assorted birds directly onto the shivering Bakugo . \n", "Those thoughts included ; Why won t this fucker put on clothes ? It s fucking SNOWING , Oh my gods my feet are going to die of frostbite , He ($_bakugo) is too warm I think I m going to fall asleep next to him ($_bakugo) and he ($_bakugo) will never let me live it down , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s least favorite , If Kirishima ($_kirishima) doesn t put his ($_bakugo) goddamn hands on me right now I m going to die . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to not be phased by anything , if anything he ($_bakugo) got even hotter then he ($_bakugo) had before . Not physically , Bakugo ($_bakugo) wasn t sure that was possible , the dragon seemed to radiate even more heat than usual . Oftentimes , Bakugo ($_bakugo) would find himself ($_bakugo) shivering and instantly Kirishima ($_kirishima) would be standing near him ($_bakugo) before he ($_bakugo) could think to grab another fur . Having his ($_bakugo) own personal furnace seemed like a good idea , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) s adamant desire to expose as much skin as possible while standing nearly looming over him ($_bakugo) added a whole slew of problems into the mix \n", "Every night as Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifted into his ($_kirishima) dragon form , Bakugo ($_bakugo) watched him ($_kirishima) with a mix of envy and irritation . The air around him ($_kirishima) was warm , comforting , and every night the dragon raised a wing , inviting him ($_kirishima) inside . \n", " Whenever Kirishima edged closer to him ($_bakugo) from then on , Bakugo ($_bakugo) made sure to pierce him ($_bakugo) with his ($_bakugo) glare . He ($_bakugo) knew what Kirishima ($_kirishima) was doing , Bakugo ($_bakugo) just refused to speak to him ($_bakugo) about it , saying this sort of thing aloud felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy . There was no way this_fucker ($_bakugo) was going to get him ($_bakugo) to snuggle , Bakugo ($_bakugo) was NOT a hugging person . But Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to get touchier as the temperature dropped , his ($_kirishima) hands warm on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s shoulders or back . It slowed him ($_kirishima) down , Bakugo ($_bakugo) s entire being relishing the warmth oozing into his ($_kirishima) body . But he ($_kirishima) always pulled away . Despite what Bakugo ($_bakugo) told himself ($_kirishima) day ($_day) after day ($_day) , his ($_kirishima) body still cried out for Kirishima ($_kirishima) s touch until he ($_kirishima) forced it deep , deep down .", "After a few more futile tries , Bakugo ($_bakugo) gave up to grab at Kirishima 's shoulders again , his ($_bakugo) nail digging into the supple muscle , holding on for dear life . The thrusting and grinding was only going stronger , faster . Kirishima at this point was pumping Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hips for him ($_bakugo) with one arm , Bakugo ($_bakugo) not able to keep up , being jostled around like a ragdoll . Pa -- Pants ! Bakugo ($_bakugo) gasped out , digging his ($_bakugo) nails in sharply as pleasure shot through him ($_bakugo) , white spots dancing on his ($_bakugo) vision . \n", " So if you ll have me , I d like to take you , Kirishima ($_kirishima) growled . Kirishima ($_kirishima) set a ruthless pace , his ($_kirishima) hips turning into a rough grind , their hips never leaving contact away from each other for even a second . It tore a shout of , YES , shit yes , from Bakugo ($_bakugo) s throat before that turned into desperate panting for breath . . He ($_kirishima) was pretty sure Kirishima ($_kirishima) was going to burn him ($_kirishima) , his ($_kirishima) skin so hot , his ($_kirishima) dick an inferno .", " He ($_kirishima) needed to touch that skin . Arms shaking , Bakugo ($_bakugo) fought to open his ($_bakugo) belt , fumbling , scratching at the knot that tied them shut . Knot . Oh fuck dragon s dicks had knots . The surge of arousal that shot through him ($_bakugo) at the idea of taking Kirishima ($_kirishima) s knot had him ($_bakugo) struggling for air as he ($_bakugo) forced down his ($_bakugo) impending orgasm .", " Kirishima ($_kirishima) s head jerked up , fingers clenching harder around Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hips . The man in question was looking down at him ($_bakugo) , eyes burning .", " His ($_bakugo) face was beet red , flushed , lips bitten and shiny . If Bakugo ($_bakugo) was about to tell him ($_bakugo) to get off , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was pretty sure he ($_bakugo) would erupt into flames right then and there . His ($_bakugo) skin felt like it was restless , itching and burning , aching to grab the blond and never let him ($_bakugo) back up out of his ($_bakugo) reach . There was only one type of off_Kirishima ($_kirishima) was interested in getting right now .", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) pushed himself ($_bakugo) upright on shaking arms , stopping when he ($_bakugo) was sitting up straight , staring at him ($_bakugo) . In order to maintain eye contact , Kirishima ($_kirishima) drew back and sat up to his ($_bakugo) full height too , causing Bakugo ($_bakugo) to have to now look above his ($_bakugo) eyeline . Bakugo ($_bakugo) glowered at him ($_bakugo) . What do you ($_bakugo) think you ($_bakugo) 're playing at ? \n", " All of a sudden , Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled up , a woosh of cold air returning to fill the unoccupied space . His ($_bakugo) hand resumed its spot on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s waist , gripping him ($_bakugo) tight to lift the entire lower half of his ($_bakugo) body into the air . With one huge hand , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was holding his ($_kirishima) hips and legs 2 feet above the ground easily , muscles not even strained .", " What the fuUUCK , Bakugo ($_bakugo) managed to say before he ($_bakugo) was being moved again .", " Abruptly , Kirishima ($_kirishima) s arm spread Bakugo ($_bakugo) s legs apart , exposing Bakugo ($_bakugo) shamelessly to his ($_bakugo) gaze . He ($_bakugo) came back down to brace himself ($_bakugo) over Bakugo ($_bakugo) , caging him ($_bakugo) in under his ($_bakugo) body . His ($_bakugo) hips returned to meet Bakugo ($_bakugo) s , drawing out a whine . Kirishima ($_kirishima) what -- '' Bakugo ($_bakugo) tried to say before Kirishima ($_kirishima) ground his ($_bakugo) hips particularly hard against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s and the complaint dissolved into a moan .", " Kirishima ($_kirishima) nearly slammed him ($_bakugo) to the ground at that , only the fur of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s cape keeping his ($_bakugo) back from smashing to the cold floor of the forest . Chills shot up his ($_bakugo) spine with the accompanying sting of his ($_bakugo) injury . Bakugo ($_bakugo) ignored it . It did n't take long for Kirishima ($_kirishima) to climb on top of the smaller man , engulfing him ($_bakugo) with warmth , his ($_bakugo) weight absolutely smothering him ($_bakugo) . Bakugo ($_bakugo) scrambled for a handhold and pulled himself ($_bakugo) closer , letting out a disgracefully needy moan . Fuck , was Kirishima eloquent reply , the words sounding stuck in his ($_bakugo) throat . His ($_bakugo) voice had dropped during their vigorous activities , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) wanted to see how far it would go .", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) groaned at the image that painted in his ($_bakugo) mind of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hips pounding his ($_bakugo) massive dick into him ($_bakugo) , instead of just against him ($_bakugo) . His ($_bakugo) own dick was as hard as a rock at this point , he ($_bakugo) wasn t sure he ($_bakugo) had ever been this hard in his ($_bakugo) goddamn life . \n", "This is how dragons court , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said hoarsely , his ($_bakugo) hips snapping rapidly against Bakugo ($_bakugo) s own . He ($_bakugo) mouthed at the tender skin of Bakugo s neck with his ($_bakugo) teeth . We find the one we want and we dominate them , showing them how much we want to fuck them , how we want to breed them up . \n", "Alright alright , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said , drawing back a little bit to look at the wound closer for the first time . It really wasn t that bad but Kirishima ($_kirishima) could see the irritation on the edges of the puckered skin . It was healing , no open sores he ($_bakugo) was glad to see . He ($_bakugo) wouldn t get sick from licking something like that , but that didn t mean it tasted good . Bakugo ($_bakugo) had indeed kept the wound clean but Kirishima ($_kirishima) had a mission and dammit he ($_bakugo) was going to get his ($_bakugo) tongue on Bakugo ($_bakugo) in any way he ($_bakugo) could . \n", "The first lick was a little sour , but the choked gasp that escaped from Bakugo ($_bakugo) made it worth it . He ($_bakugo) laved his ($_bakugo) tongue over it again , then again , and a third time , losing himself ($_bakugo) in the taste of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s skin . Kirishima ($_kirishima) brought his ($_bakugo) right hand down to grip Bakugo s hip , thumbing over the hip bone jutting out , clenching tight over the skin . His ($_bakugo) nails scratched the skin but if anything , that made Bakugo ($_bakugo) shudder even harder . \n", " What was that? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked teasingly , a nail accidentally scraping down his pec and Bakugo ($_bakugo) gave a full body shudder at that , Kirishima ($_kirishima) readjusting to support his weight . He scooted closer , edging his way in-between Bakugo ($_bakugo) s legs , spreading them wider with his own , ignoring Bakugo ($_bakugo) s grumbles . Leaning closer down , Kirishima ($_kirishima) carefully nosed the hard planes of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s stomach . They twitched , and he exhaled a long breath over them .", " One of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s arms came up to smack him in the head . Stop fucking around , he grumbled , but there was no heat behind the words . If anything , Bakugo ($_bakugo) sounded strained , his ($_bakugo) arm falling back quickly to support his ($_bakugo) body that was stretching further behind him ($_bakugo) . He ($_bakugo) was spread out , chest heaving , waiting for him ($_bakugo) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) had to take a deep breath this time . He ($_bakugo) resettled his ($_bakugo) hands into a position to support Bakugo s weight .", " Chancing another glance up , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was surprised to see Bakugo ($_bakugo) already looking down at him ($_bakugo) past his ($_bakugo) heaving chest , his ($_bakugo) eyes dilated and wide . His ($_bakugo) lip was pulled tight into his ($_bakugo) mouth with teeth biting down on the fullness , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) vividly felt his ($_bakugo) body scream out in response . Gods he ($_bakugo) wished that was him ($_bakugo) . In response , he ($_bakugo) sucked his ($_bakugo) hip bone into his ($_bakugo) mouth sloppily , sucking sharply on the protrusion . A keening sound escaped Bakugo in surprise , hips jerking up , digging Kirishima s teeth in past the flesh . That only made him ($_bakugo) shudder even more and Kirishima ($_kirishima) deepened the bite as fire shot through his ($_bakugo) own bones . Releasing his ($_bakugo) jaw after a moment , Kirishima ($_kirishima) licked gently over the fresh pinpricks of blood .", " A quick look up made Kirishima ($_kirishima) groan at the sight of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s flushed face , his ($_bakugo) eyes and lips clenched shut . He ($_bakugo) doubled his ($_bakugo) efforts , tongue pressing probably harder than he ($_bakugo) should have , spreading his ($_bakugo) tongue flat , letting himself ($_bakugo) drool over his ($_bakugo) skin . If he ($_bakugo) was covering an area wider than the wound now , he ($_bakugo) mentally told himself ($_bakugo) it was better safe than sorry . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s skin was smooth , only disturbed by the occasional scar , ones Kirishima ($_kirishima) was more than glad to lick over . He ($_bakugo) started to make his ($_bakugo) way over them as well , tongue slobbering , occasionally letting his ($_bakugo) sharp teeth drag . Dizzily , Kirishima ($_kirishima) wondered if Bakugo ($_bakugo) excreted some sort of addicting substance to make him ($_bakugo) press this far , knowing how the other male felt about his ($_bakugo) advances . Kirishima ($_kirishima) decided it did n't matter , the breathy gasps that occasionally got through Bakugo ($_bakugo) s flushed lips were the softest things he ($_bakugo) had ever heard from Bakugo ($_bakugo) .", "He ($_bakugo) wanted more . \n", "After that talk , which Bakugo ($_bakugo) was sure Kirishima didn t even listen fully to , their meals started literally dropping from the sky . \n", " As a dragon , Kirishima ($_kirishima) didn t need clothes , but when he ($_kirishima) shifted into a human form , he ($_kirishima) just paraded around naked until Bakugo ($_bakugo) screamed enough at him ($_kirishima) . The_dragon_man_still_didn_t ($_kirishima) understand why clothing was so important , being far more comfortable without it . He ($_kirishima) had lived his ($_kirishima) whole life as a dragon without them , why change now ? And of course he ($_kirishima) was confident , Kirishima ($_kirishima) was practically sculpted .", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) was far less comfortable with it , he ($_kirishima) didn t need Kirishima s bulked up muscles parading around on display all the time . He ($_kirishima) definitely was not getting distracted by the_other_man ($_kirishima) . Not at all .", "His ($_bakugo) legs trembled at the admission causing the dragon to inhale sharply , fighting the urge to pin down the other male and fuck him ($_bakugo) into the ground . Delightedly , he ($_bakugo) realized he ($_bakugo) did n't have to force that back anymore , and he ($_bakugo) lifted Bakugo up off of the log and ground him ($_bakugo) fiercely against his ($_bakugo) own dick . \n", " Bakugo ($_bakugo) was not prepared for the sheer size of whatever that THING was in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s pants . I mean , obviously it was his ($_bakugo) dick but holy fuck , that thing felt like an extra fucking limb .", " It was thick as hell and Bakugo ($_bakugo) could n't tell where it ($_bakugo) ended and where it ($_bakugo) began .", " It ($_bakugo) was also warm , radiating the heat Bakugo ($_bakugo) so desperately craved . He ($_bakugo) pressed himself ($_bakugo) closer , unashamed of his ($_bakugo) actions anymore , grinding down harder . The rush of warmth that followed had him ($_bakugo) clutching tighter . You 're like a fucking furnace , he ($_bakugo) said roughly . Been dying for you to touch me .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) was now pretty sure he ($_kirishima) has been on track all along . The lump in Bakugo ($_bakugo) s pants he ($_kirishima) was seen earlier was now flush against his ($_kirishima) hips , and he ($_kirishima) was pretty damn sure he ($_kirishima) understood that aspect of human behavior . \n", "No , no this is n't , Bakugo ($_bakugo) confirmed . He ($_bakugo) finally looked up at Kirishima ($_kirishima) and the confident smirk was back that Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew and loved was back . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) was pretty lost on what was happening now , but the wandering that Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hands were doing across his ($_bakugo) shoulders was very encouraging . What else is something that friends do n't do ? he ($_bakugo) asked . He ($_bakugo) licked his ($_bakugo) lips nervously , watching with pride that Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes followed the movement . In response , Bakugo ($_bakugo) fully pressed their hips together . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) s hands palmed Kirishima ($_kirishima) s back , clenching around the thick muscles . His ($_bakugo) voice caught in his ($_bakugo) throat as he ($_bakugo) squeezed . You -- You 're just so fucking HOT_,_Bakugo ($_bakugo) admitted . \n", " With a sigh of relief , Kirishima ($_kirishima) buried his ($_kirishima) face into the curve is Bakugo s shoulder and neck , sliding his ($_kirishima) unoccupied hand into soft , soft hair . He ($_kirishima) pulled sharply , and Bakugo ($_bakugo) s head went easily back , baring his ($_kirishima) neck in a sinful arch . Kirishima ($_kirishima) wasted no time in sucking in any exposed skin into his ($_kirishima) mouth , mindful of his ($_kirishima) teeth . Bakugo ($_bakugo) let out a deep groan and Kirishima ($_kirishima) responded in kind , louder , more guttural as he ($_kirishima) sucked and nibbled his ($_kirishima) way across the exposed skin . He ($_kirishima) breathed in deeply and rolled his ($_kirishima) muscles forward as he ($_kirishima) felt Bakugo ($_bakugo) shift as well , his ($_kirishima) hands clutching at his ($_kirishima) shoulders . I thought you were never going to let me in , Kirishima ($_kirishima) admitted , voice rough .", "Me neither , Bakugo ($_bakugo) admitted . Guess that makes the both of us then . \n", "His ($_bakugo) eyes were burning , dilated and almost possessive ? \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) towered over Bakugo ($_bakugo) , having a good 2 feet on the average male . He ($_bakugo) was a solid wall of muscle , rippling pectorals , a jawline sculpted by god himself ($_bakugo) . Or perhaps the devil himself ($_bakugo) because Bakugo ($_bakugo) was surely going to hell for the thoughts running through his ($_bakugo) mind right now as he ($_bakugo) stared openly . The light from the campfire set Kirishima 's rough skin aglow , creating a soft halo around the_man ($_bakugo) . His ($_bakugo) long hair was down , cascading down his ($_bakugo) shoulders in whisps , catching the dying light , lighting up like the sunset Bakugo ($_bakugo) could no longer see without associating with Kirishima ($_kirishima) .

And put some pants on . \n", "Tsking angrily , Bakugo ($_bakugo) snatched it out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands and threw it further away from them . Yeah but it s dirty ! You can t cover something in dead animal blood then expect me to fucking dress a wound with it idiot ! \n", "Then will it work ? he ($_bakugo) pressed . \n", "Incredulously , Bakugo ($_bakugo) struggled to twist around in the strong grip , forcing his ($_bakugo) head back to yell but his ($_bakugo) words died in his ($_bakugo) throat . On a normal day , Bakugo ($_bakugo) didn t think too much about how much bigger the_other_man ($_bakugo) was than him ($_bakugo) , but he ($_bakugo) was fiercely reminded of that fact now . \n", "Faster then he ($_bakugo) could process , Kirishima ($_kirishima) jumped over to him ($_bakugo) , twisting his ($_bakugo) wrist back behind him ($_bakugo) , forcing him ($_bakugo) to stop . A deep guttural growl rumbled out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s throat , making his ($_bakugo) next words come out deeper than usual . Don t you dare , I hunted it , I cook it . \n", "I m capable of cooking you dumb fuck , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said , getting up and stomping angrily over to what remained of the deer . \n", "Their journey continued but at a slower pace .

Often times Kirishima ($_kirishima) would start to crowd him ($_bakugo) in close , hands grabbing at the small of his ($_bakugo) back before Bakugo ($_bakugo) would pull away roughly . It made Bakugo ($_bakugo) too dizzy . \n", " For the last fucking time , no , I m not paying some quack to tell me how to clean a wound . It s fine , Bakugo ($_bakugo) said wearily for what must have been the fifth time . Seriously , Kirishima ($_kirishima) expected him to drop dead of something over a scratch ? No matter how much it did actually feel like it was burning , Bakugo ($_bakugo) would rather jump in the river then admit that to Kirishima . He ($_bakugo) bit the rest of the meat from the bird violently , throwing the bones into the fire . The remaining fat sizzled loudly in the stillness .", "The look that Kirishima ($_kirishima) gave him ($_bakugo) was thoughtful . Could I look at it then ? \n", "Haah ?

I know some basic healing . \n", "Squinting his ($_bakugo) eyes suspiciously , Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked him ($_bakugo) over .

Plus he ($_bakugo) had no possessions , what would he ($_bakugo) use to do it ? He ($_bakugo) voiced that to his ($_bakugo) companion , who to his ($_bakugo) surprise , looked sheepish . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) gave him ($_bakugo) an unimpressed stare until Kirishima ($_kirishima) elaborated . I uh , I can heal some minor infections and cuts and stuff like that though uh -- through the dragon stuff , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said , his ($_kirishima) face beginning to color . \n", "In a way of answering , Kirishima ($_kirishima) just opened his ($_kirishima) mouth and let his ($_kirishima) tongue flop out .

The animals in the town , yeah sure , he bought those , he s not a complete asshole . But deer in the woods ? Those belonged to no one , so it was fair game for Bakugo ($_bakugo) to kill . Fair game for him ($_bakugo) to eat . But his ($_bakugo) explosions were too dangerous and loud to use in a forest .

He ($_bakugo) released the hand from over his ($_bakugo) own mouth and placed it flat on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest to join his ($_bakugo) other hand , long since released from its fist . The moist warmth sent a hot wave of arousal through Kirishima ($_kirishima) , one that only grew stronger when Bakugo ($_bakugo) pressed his ($_bakugo) legs closer around Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hips .", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes narrowed . Do n't patronize me . You ($_bakugo) know what I mean . \n", "This ($_bakugo) is n't a game , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said softly . \n", " That seemed to take Bakugo ($_bakugo) by surprise . Gifts ? You ($_bakugo) mean the fucking flowers ? he ($_kirishima) asked incredulously . How am I supposed to tell anything from that ?", "Belatedly , Kirishima ($_kirishima) realizes his ($_kirishima) hands were still gripping Bakugo ($_bakugo) s body . He ($_kirishima) palmed over the skin , clenching tighter using the leverage to pull Bakugo ($_bakugo) closer to his ($_kirishima) chest .

Wait , you ($_bakugo) did n't know ? \n", " There was a tense silence as Bakugo ($_bakugo) looked down and away from him ($_bakugo) .

Soon , his ($_bakugo) muffled laughter was heard , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt that sharp stab of shame again . He ($_bakugo) must have gotten misinformation about human courting ; what had he ($_bakugo) done wrong ? It was similar enough to how he ($_bakugo) was taught to do it but Bakugo ($_bakugo) was n't a dragon . Dragon courting was . different.", " I 've been courting you ($_bakugo) , Kirishima ($_kirishima) admitted . The flood of arousal was starting to leak away and was replaced with the sharp ache of embarrassment . He ($_bakugo) did n't know ?", " Bringing you ($_bakugo) fresh food and cooking it , tending to your ($_bakugo) wounds , expressing care over your ($_bakugo) state of being ; is that not how humans show their affection ? You ($_bakugo) do n't seem to like physical contact , but you ($_bakugo) liked the food and I think the flowers ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) hesitated again to look down at Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Did you ($_bakugo) ?", " Unphased by both the screaming and the violence , Kirishima ($_kirishima) approached the deer and hefted it to his ($_kirishima) shoulder , Bakugo unintentionally getting a front seat view of his ($_kirishima) well muscled ass . Not that he ($_kirishima) was looking , he ($_kirishima) reminded himself ($_kirishima) . As Kirishima ($_kirishima) righted himself ($_kirishima) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) had to intake a short breath . The blood trickled down Kirishima ($_kirishima) s body , running in red lines down the hard lines of his ($_kirishima) muscles , smearing as the limp legs of the deer moved . Well , either way , it s dinner . Is that good ? Do you like it ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) said earnestly .", "Growling , Bakugo ($_bakugo) snapped his ($_bakugo) gaze back up and punched the_man ($_kirishima) s arm . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s smile didn t even budge , his ($_bakugo) skin firm , the dumbass probably didn t even feel it ($_kirishima) . IT S NOT TENDERIZED , IT S OBLIVIATED ! \n", "Okay , okay , was the easy-going reply . Bakugo ($_bakugo) may or may not have eyed his ($_bakugo) traveling partner as he ($_bakugo) crouched down on the other side of the fire , his ($_bakugo) thighs and backside straining and tensing with the movement his ($_bakugo) body was doing . \n", "The blood had trailed down Kirishima ($_kirishima) s pecs and down across his ($_kirishima) abs , and down further south . Bakugo ($_bakugo) eyed him ($_kirishima) unabashed before ripping his ($_kirishima) eyes back up to Kirishima ($_kirishima) s when he ($_kirishima) spoke . Their eyes met and something flickered there before Bakugo ($_bakugo) turned back to the fire , grunting . It s fine , just cook it . He ($_kirishima) could almost feel Kirishima ($_kirishima) s answering grin on his ($_kirishima) skin so he ($_kirishima) snapped . Then go jump in a river you re disgusting . \n", "Definitely was just making sure he ($_bakugo) was skinning the deer right . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) dropped the meat from the sky again , the THUMP rattling their minimalist campsite . Bakugo didn t even look up from where he ($_bakugo) was laying , arms crossed behind his ($_bakugo) head . He ($_bakugo) had been TRYING to take a nap , trying to use the time Kirishima ($_kirishima) was gone so it was finally quiet to catch up on some well deserved sleep . \n", "The troll put up a pretty good fight , his large spiked club flying through the air with ease , putting Bakugo ($_bakugo) more on guard as he had to dodge the surprisingly fast movement of something so heavy . However , the troll managed to catch Bakugo ($_bakugo) enough to slam him in the side , sending him flying to the rock wall . There was a booming roar as Kirishima ($_kirishima) shifted to his full form , ruby scaled dragon that towered over the troll . It stood absolutely no chance . All it took was one stream of flame and the troll was toasted . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s heavy foot crushing the troll s head was probably just an extra precaution . \n", " The villagers had been cautious at the two ragged looking strangers in their midst , but mentioned the missing livestock and tremors coming from the woods . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s feral grin at the news probably hadn t reassured them , but they set off for the woods at once . It took two days but they had found a feral troll by the mountains nearest the town , the entrance to the cave littered with bones and ram horns . This was obviously the thief .", " His ($_bakugo) thought process was brought to an immediate halt as Kirishima ($_kirishima) slammed back down , bringing their hips together with a lewd smack . The feeling of the hot and wet slide of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s dick against his ($_bakugo) own , Bakugo ($_bakugo) came almost immediately , screaming loudly . He ($_bakugo) spasmed , jerking in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s iron grip as he ($_bakugo) rode out the most intense orgasm of his ($_bakugo) life as Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to thrust . Kirishima didn t even seem to notice , grunting into Bakugo ($_bakugo) s neck , the breath he ($_bakugo) was exhaling so hot it almost scalding Bakugo ($_bakugo) . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes felt like they were going to roll up in the back of his ($_bakugo) head the combined pleasure was so intense . He ($_bakugo) was still hard even though he ($_bakugo) could feel the squelching of his ($_bakugo) cum mixing with whatever Kirishima ($_kirishima) s dick was excreting , rubbing all over his ($_bakugo) hips and dripping over . It dribbled down his ($_bakugo) ass crack and he ($_bakugo) moaned again , head throwing back as he ($_bakugo) clutched desperately to Kirishima .", " Grunting , Kirishima ($_kirishima) leaned up to rip Bakugo ($_bakugo) s pants away , the waistline shredding and with another tug , they bore no resemblance to pants anymore . The remaining fabric on his legs was holding on by sheer will and the clenching Bakugo ($_bakugo) s thigh muscles around Kirishima ($_kirishima) s waist . Briefly , Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt a rush of anger for the loss of his ($_bakugo) favorite pair of pants , but that passed a lot quicker than he ($_bakugo) was proud of . With another rip , Kirishima ($_kirishima) ripped a hole in the front of his ($_bakugo) own pants , and a dick nearly the size of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s forearm came bobbing out , glistening wet in the light . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s mouth went immediately dry at the sight and he ($_bakugo) was sure he ($_bakugo) would never be able to let Kirishima ($_kirishima) walk around naked around him ($_bakugo) again . The thing had nearly doubled in size and looked more like an actual dragons dick then human dick like it had before . What the fuck had happened ?", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) s laugh sounded like bells and Bakugo ($_bakugo) couldn t even find himself to be angry . \n", "Bakugo ($_bakugo) was pretty sure Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew what was happening , he ($_bakugo) looked far too smug with himself ($_bakugo) . When he ($_bakugo) handed over dinner that night , Bakugo ($_bakugo) nearly dropped his ($_bakugo) skewered fish when Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand closed over his ($_bakugo) in the transaction . Even after throwing a half-hearted fit , Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to watch him ($_bakugo) , slowly eating his ($_bakugo) own meal . Bakugo ($_bakugo) wanted to punch him ($_bakugo) in his ($_bakugo) stupid kissable face . \n", "The weather began to chill . Bakugo ($_bakugo) began to wear his ($_bakugo) furs more and more often , wrapping them around himself ($_bakugo) crouched as close to the fire as he ($_bakugo) could . Cold temperatures really ate away at him ($_bakugo) , his ($_bakugo) body aching in the frigid temperatures . Plus , the gash from the troll had yet to fully heal , it stabbed away at him ($_bakugo) whenever he ($_bakugo) moved . \n", "Another time , the roar of a bear he ($_bakugo) was fighting send goosebumps over every inch of skin , throwing him ($_bakugo) completely off guard . \n", "That of course , was nothing compared to when Kirishima ($_kirishima) was actually near him ($_bakugo) . \n", "Now that he ($_bakugo) was aware of the electric feeling running through him ($_bakugo) when he ($_bakugo) was near Kirishima ($_kirishima) , Bakugo ($_bakugo) could never relax . It seemed to follow him ($_bakugo) everywhere , no matter if he ($_bakugo) was with the dragon or not . \n", "Once , he ($_bakugo) had been fishing in the stream and the sight of a pile of red stones at the bottom of the lake had him ($_bakugo) dropping his ($_bakugo) fishing line out of shock . \n", "He ($_bakugo) narrowed his ($_bakugo) eyes , ignoring the chill that was seeping into his ($_bakugo) skin the further he ($_bakugo) stood from the dragon . Just fucking cook dinner , I m hungry . \n", "Ignoring the soft calls of his ($_bakugo) name , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stalked away to sit in a huff , back to the fire . Turning his ($_bakugo) back pointedly so he ($_bakugo) wouldn t have to face Kirishima ($_kirishima) , or to pointedly ignore the way every fiber of his ($_bakugo) being was telling him ($_bakugo) to turn back around and press himself ($_bakugo) closer . \n", "The grip tightened on Bakugo ($_bakugo) s wrist and he ($_bakugo) gasped involuntarily . The sound sent ripples across Kirishima ($_kirishima) s shoulders and his ($_bakugo) eyes turned smoldering . The air seemed to waver between them and Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt warm , heat radiating from him ($_bakugo) . Let go of me idiot , he ($_bakugo) said , his ($_bakugo) voice barely a whisper . \n", "A rumble echoed out of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s chest again and it ($_kirishima) seemed to snap Kirishima ($_kirishima) out of whatever trance he ($_bakugo) had been in . His ($_bakugo) hand slackened immediately and Bakugo ($_bakugo) ripped himself ($_bakugo) from the hold on his ($_bakugo) wrist , backing away . Kirishima ($_kirishima) continued to stand there , looking at Bakugo ($_bakugo) as if he ($_bakugo) was seeing him ($_bakugo) for the first time . Bakugo ($_bakugo) he ($_bakugo) said under his ($_bakugo) breath , Bakugo_barely_hearing_it ($_bakugo) . \n", "After the whoosh of air that followed Kirishima ($_kirishima) s soaring wings , there was a loud THUMP on the other side of the camp that had Bakugo whirling around , defenses up . There was a bloodied corpse and he ($_bakugo) approached it cautiously . \n", "Flushing deeply , Bakugo ($_bakugo) clutched it tighter around his ($_bakugo) shoulder . Mate he ($_bakugo) mused . I guess that works instead of boyfriend . \n", " Yeah , Bakugo ($_bakugo) grunted . It sure fucking did . Gently , Kirishima ($_kirishima) set down Bakugo ($_bakugo) onto his ($_bakugo) feet and removed the thoroughly soiled cape from around his ($_bakugo) shoulders . It was promptly replaced with a blood red cloak , the dragon wrapping him ($_bakugo) snugly in the length of cloth . Did you steal this one too ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) grumbled .", "You think ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) responded dryly . \n", " I m sorry , he said earnestly . I really am . Groaning , Bakugo ($_bakugo) turned away from the devout gaze of his ($_bakugo) dumb fucking friend and rubbed his ($_bakugo) eyes vigorously .", " His ($_bakugo) groan dragged out until it crescendoed into a shout , then a scream . Kirishima ($_kirishima) just held him ($_bakugo) tightly as he ($_bakugo) screamed himself ($_bakugo) hoarse , then settled back , panting . Did that . help?", "Drowsily , he registered being turned over , and he looked up at the worried dragon head peering over at him . I m fine but if you could just , chill the fuck out for 5 minutes , that d be great , Bakugo ($_bakugo) mumbled , waving a hand dismissively . Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled and backed off . \n", " There was the sound of crunching and shifting and moments later , and the human version of Kirishima ($_kirishima) came trotting back . He kneeled down and lifted Bakugo ($_bakugo) up into his arms easily . Oh shit I m sorry , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said earnestly , but from the looks of his beaming grin , he wasn t sorry one bit .", " I guess that was a lot all at once . I just he trailed off and Bakugo ($_bakugo) could see his jaw muscles clenching . He gazed down at Bakugo ($_bakugo) and inexplicably the man felt vulnerable under his gaze of outright adoration . I ve wanted this for so long for that I guess I went overboard .", "Some of them do , Bakugo ($_bakugo) explained softly . You can call them anything you want to though . \n", " Kirishima ($_kirishima) wrapped his ($_kirishima) arms around Bakugo ($_bakugo) and bent down to nuzzle to top of his ($_kirishima) hair . We can do whatever you want to . Boyfriend , mate , whatever works , he ($_kirishima) said contentedly , but Bakugo ($_bakugo) could tell how pleased he ($_kirishima) was . They d figure it out , they had time . His ($_kirishima) cheek squished against Kirishima ($_kirishima) s bare chest , soaking in the warmth and the steady sound of his ($_kirishima) heartbeat .", " Dragons must show affection differently , Bakugo ($_bakugo) would have to teach Kirishima ($_kirishima) to kiss , he ($_kirishima) thought absentmindedly , playing with the hem of his ($_kirishima) new coat . Though handling that tongue and those sharp teeth was going to be a whole other kind of adventure . Bakugo ($_bakugo) sighed deeply , and then smirked as he ($_bakugo) watched goosebumps form on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s skin in response .", " Bringing his ($_bakugo) hands up , Kirishima ($_kirishima) easily moved Bakugo ($_bakugo) s arms apart and his ($_bakugo) palms slid up his ($_bakugo) arms slowly to brush the thick cape out of the way and over his ($_bakugo) shoulders . Bakugo ($_bakugo) shuddered at the feeling , moving his ($_bakugo) arms down to clutch at the rough scaley , wood beneath him ($_bakugo) to steady himself ($_bakugo) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands were so big . So warm. So rough. Bakugos thoughts ran disjointed through his ($_bakugo) head as Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands ran back down his ($_bakugo) chest . Cold ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked quietly as Bakugo ($_bakugo) shuddered again .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled and at this close , Bakugo ($_bakugo) could hear it rumble , pinpricks of heat dotting his ($_bakugo) skin . Finally , he ($_bakugo) said easily and shifted so that he ($_bakugo) was kneeling in front of the sitting Bakugo . \n", "Jutting his ($_bakugo) chin out in response , Bakugo ($_bakugo) stubbornly ignored the flush he ($_bakugo) knew was covering his ($_bakugo) face . Well , get on with it then , he ($_bakugo) snapped , crossing his ($_bakugo) arms angrily . \n", "Basically , Kirishima ($_kirishima) said solemnly , stood up and came to crouch in front of where Bakugo ($_bakugo) sat on a fallen log . Are you cool with that ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) stubbornly ignored his ($_bakugo) body s instinct to shy backward . He ($_bakugo) had never been more glad in his ($_bakugo) life that the colder weather had convinced Kirishima ($_kirishima) to at least put on some pants and a sad excuse for a vest that covered nothing . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s eyes flickered on Kirishima ($_kirishima) s crouching thighs , then erect nipples before up to his ($_bakugo) face where Kirishima ($_kirishima) s expression told him ($_bakugo) he ($_bakugo) had not been subtle enough . \n", "What the fuck , Bakugo ($_bakugo) echoed . You want to spit on me to heal this shit ? He ($_bakugo) opened the furs dramatically to reveal his ($_bakugo) bare chest and the angry red slash that was lower down . The cold air stung , making him ($_bakugo) flinch . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) smirked around his ($_bakugo) lolling tongue and Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt a shot of arousal straight down to his ($_bakugo) dick . The tongue flexed and Bakugo ($_bakugo) was pretty sure he ($_bakugo) must look like an idiot right now as he ($_bakugo) just oogled Kirishima ($_kirishima) s tongue . Thankfully for his ($_bakugo) dignity , Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled it back into his ($_bakugo) mouth to reply , My saliva can clean minor wounds . \n", "What the actual fuck ? Bakugo ($_bakugo) said when he ($_bakugo) could form words . He ($_bakugo) swallowed around a suspiciously dry throat . \n", " Not that Bakugo ($_bakugo) was much better off . Hypocrite , he ($_kirishima) said softly , spending most of his ($_kirishima) current thought process fighting with his ($_kirishima) body to buck into the hands that were basically groping over his ($_kirishima) chest now . With every drag of Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands , Bakugo ($_bakugo) felt like his ($_kirishima) head was swimming . He ($_kirishima) had never experienced such a feeling , the new sensation of calloused skin across his ($_kirishima) chest had both his ($_kirishima) heart and his ($_kirishima) arms shaking . Bakugo ($_bakugo) s dick throbbed in his ($_bakugo) pants as with a deep breath , his ($_bakugo) lungs expanded , raising his ($_bakugo) chest closer to Kirishima s touch .", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hands grabbed the sides of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s torso , the bones of Bakugo ($_bakugo) s rib cage shifting under his ($_bakugo) pale skin . He ($_bakugo) rubbed him ($_bakugo) slowly , the warmth of his ($_bakugo) hands spreading across Bakugo ($_bakugo) s chest . After a pause , his ($_bakugo) hands shifted , thumbs extended just enough to catch on Bakugo s nipples , brushing on them gently . You sure about that ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked , his ($_kirishima) voice slightly breathless . \n"], "($_away)": ["Bakugo_scoffed_,_pointedly_looked_away_from_Kirishima ($_away) Kirishima ($_kirishima) s easy nakedness while he ($_away) looked at the blood pooling at their feet . No shit . But did you have to drop it ?
