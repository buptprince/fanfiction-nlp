As the commander attempted to block a blow from Midoriya ($_midoriya) s blade , leaving his side exposed , Midoriya ($_midoriya) lashed out , kicking at his ribs with the bottom of his shoe . The kick sent the commander flying to the ground , his back colliding with the whitewashed stones of the courtyard . He rolled onto his stomach , pushing himself up onto a knee , he pointed the tip of his blade at Midoriya , who knocked aside the tip of his sword with his own . Hopping to his feet , the commander beat back Midoriya ($_midoriya) with his sword .", "Using the momentum of the block , the commander swung with the pommel of his blade , knocking Midoriya ($_midoriya) to the ground .

Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) let herself ($_yaoyorozu) in , giving a quick nod to Midoriya before escorting the two of them down to the courtyard where the guards were already lined up . Midoriya ($_midoriya) noticed that in the front row right next to the guard Todoroki ($_todoroki) had embarrassed previously was the commander he ($_midoriya) had run into what seemed like an eternity ago . \n", "The man fixed his ($_midoriya) eyes upon Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , a gaze Midoriya ($_midoriya) was all too quick in avoiding , choosing instead to focus his ($_midoriya) own gaze on a pair of blooming fire lilies that had been planted along the courtyard . The flowers letting off a heady fragrance that reminded one of a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon , the red-orange petals bowed their heads underneath the sun . As he ($_midoriya) tore his ($_midoriya) gaze away from the flowers , he ($_midoriya) was startled to see Todoroki ($_todoroki) had fixed his ($_midoriya) eyes upon him ($_midoriya) . \n", "He ($_midoriya) wondered how long the_teen ($_midoriya) had been staring at him ($_midoriya) for . Todoroki ($_todoroki) turned to the knights , ordering them to pair up with one another so that they could sparr as he ($_midoriya) , Yaoyorozu and Midoriya ($_midoriya) went over to a large parasol that another servant was holding above his own head . There was a chair and a small table underneath the parasol that was laden with a pitcher of water , a cup and a plate stacked high with fresh fruit and cheeses . \n", "Sitting down in the chair , Midoriya and Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) took their places beside Todoroki ($_todoroki) s side . Midoriya ($_midoriya) remained silent as Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) leaned in toward Todoroki ($_todoroki) s ear , she ($_midoriya) smiled at something he ($_midoriya) said and let out a laugh that was soft and breathy . His ($_midoriya) eyes swept over the courtyard , studying the soldiers stances and forms as his ($_midoriya) fingers twitched and itched for the weight of a sword between them . \n", "It sounded like a wounded animal , a sound Midoriya had heard plenty of times before when he ($_midoriya) had accompanied All Might on a hunt and had to watch the man end the life of a wounded animal he ($_midoriya) had caught . Though the scream reminded Midoriya ($_midoriya) of that moment , there was a distinctly human quality to it that had his ($_midoriya) gaze being pulled toward the door that connected him ($_midoriya) to the prince s room . Without so much as a thought , he ($_midoriya) threw back the covers on the bed and raced toward the door on bare feet . Throwing open the door , he ($_midoriya) shouted for the_prince ($_the) as his ($_midoriya) gaze swiveled toward Todoroki ($_todoroki) s bed . \n", " A few weeks had passed since Midoriya ($_midoriya) had come to be in Todoroki ($_todoroki) s service , and he ($_midoriya) was finally getting used to Enten s culture and the complexities that existed within the castle walls . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s head rested comfortably upon the plush pillows that littered his ($_midoriya) bed , a soft breeze blew in from the open balcony windows offering a nice reprieve from the hot nights .", "If you were merely a servant , Todoroki ($_todoroki) cut him ($_midoriya) off , then you wouldn t have been observing my guards so closely nor would you have been spending so many nights in the library studying this_country ($_todoroki) s sword style .

Setting the tray down upon the table , he ($_midoriya) picked out the outfit the_prince ($_the) would wear for the day and laid it down upon the bed as Todoroki ($_todoroki) hurriedly ate .
