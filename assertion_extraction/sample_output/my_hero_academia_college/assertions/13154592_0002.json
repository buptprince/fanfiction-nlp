How long had the girl been walking on it ? It was in this mindless flurry of worry smothered by rudimentary medical procedure , which was in turn smothered by more worry , that Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) operated .

That would cause serious problems . The girl probably wasn t a spy . Or was she ? Were the injuries faked so the girl could literally get her foot in the door ?

Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) smiled some more , and it felt like greasy oil on her ($_tsuyu) face . She ($_tsuyu) was certain she ($_tsuyu) hadn t left anything incriminating in any of the other rooms , just the study , which was locked .

One of King Enji s larger troops were to raid a small village on the outskirts of the country , in an area that technically belonged to Keikei but most people considered Musutafu territory , assuming they d heard of it at all . A civilian target , and an undefended one at that .

Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) peeked her ($_tsuyu) head around the doorframe as the guard let himself ($_tsuyu) in and slowly turned about the room .

Who s at the door ? she ($_tsuyu) asked quietly . \n", "The package she ($_tsuyu) received was heavier than she ($_tsuyu) expected , until she ($_tsuyu) opened it and found that it not only contained her ($_tsuyu) assignment but also a secret code guide that she ($_tsuyu) would have to adhere to , a list of codenames of various members of the resistance as well as her ($_tsuyu) own . Cla omh Solais . The Sword of Light . A bit dramatic for Tsuyu s tastes , but she ($_tsuyu) assured herself ($_tsuyu) it was a precautionary measure , nothing more . \n", " That couldn t be right . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) went back over the sentence . Are camped by riverbank . Are surrounded by mountains and Yuuei Yes , that word trasnaigh definitely meant to cross . Perhaps the answer lay in the following paragraphs .", "No reason , sir , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) replied immediately . \n", "Of course not , sir . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said airily . Control yourself ! Please excuse my outburst . \n", "I oblige presently . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) showed the two guards the back rooms , which returned nothing suspicious .

She ($_tsuyu) wrote a coded message to Tokoyami asking him to meet her ($_tsuyu) on a matter of great importance relating to the resistance . It was a white lie , but Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) had done worse . The message was carried off by a different messenger boy than the first two , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) briefly wondered if the messengers were rotated or if they were replaced when one of them died . She ($_tsuyu) extinguished the thought quickly . One could only cope with so much immediate cruelty , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) exceeded her ($_tsuyu) limit long ago .", " In later years , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) would come to decide that it was that specific type of intel that made her ($_tsuyu) nearly throw up . She ($_tsuyu) never ceased to be amazed at the lengths people would go to in order to end another human life in the most traumatising way possible . A common excuse was that these people needed to be taught a lesson . But what lesson was that ? That life ends ?", " Was it that the aggressor had access to vast resources of power , and they should therefore be afraid of them ? That wasn t teaching someone a lesson . That was bullying . And Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) hated bullies more than anything .", " Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s heart jerked . The wind and rain howled and hailed outside .", " Soldiers . The night patrol , to be exact . Had someone ratted her ($_tsuyu) out ? Was this the end ?", "It was a stormy night when Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) woke to a frantic thumping coming from her ($_tsuyu) front door . Who in the world could be out there , so far into the countryside , and at such a late hour ? A needy merchant ? A lost child ? \n", "She ($_tsuyu) yanked on the iron latch and pulled the wooden door open . The icy winter winds hit her ($_tsuyu) like a slap in the face and for a split second her ($_tsuyu) lungs stopped working , frozen . Her ($_tsuyu) doorstep was dark when she ($_tsuyu) peeked around the door until she ($_tsuyu) saw the small cloaked figure huddled over on the ground , shivering . \n", "Only one way to find out . The thumping continued while Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) shrugged on a robe and shook her ($_tsuyu) hair around her ($_tsuyu) shoulders , since soldiers were less likely to harass a sleepy young lady than a cantankerous spinster . \n", "A mumble managed to make itself known to Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) throughout a series of stuttered breaths . P p-please help help me \n", " Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) knelt and reached out to place one hand on the figure s dark back . My goodness , are you okay ? she ($_tsuyu) asked . Their cloak was deathly cold and soaked through . When she ($_tsuyu) received no response , she ($_tsuyu) moved her ($_tsuyu) hand up towards what she ($_tsuyu) thought might be the hood . Drawing it back , she ($_tsuyu) could faintly make out dark brown hair , dripping from the rain . Please , are you alright ?", " The lump in Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s arms suddenly became ten times heavier . Did they ? Oh , Saints , they were probably worn out from the cold . She ($_tsuyu) gracelessly hauled the other onto her ($_tsuyu) back and brought them to her ($_tsuyu) spare room , which had grown colder than the rest of the house , the air stale from disuse . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) distantly mourned the fact that her ($_tsuyu) siblings had not come to visit her ($_tsuyu) in who knew how long , because of this damned war", "Of course ! Of course , let s get you inside , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said , employing the tone she ($_tsuyu) often used to comfort a younger sibling with a grazed knee . Wrapping an arm around the figure s shoulders , she ($_tsuyu) carefully ushered them inside , although it was more like dragging . Letting the door swing shut behind them was in itself a tiny comfort , finally being sheltered from the tempest . \n", " Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) swallowed . Throwing you ($_ochako) out prematurely would do you ($_ochako) more harm than good . You ($_ochako) have to heal completely before you ($_ochako) leave , or else your ($_ochako) weakened body would just break down completely . Don t forget you ($_ochako) ve exhausted your ($_ochako) supply of magic as well as your ($_ochako) stores of energy . Staying here won t be a problem . We ll deal with the searches when they happen .", " You can help me by focusing on getting better . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) rose to leave , but stopped by the door . One more thing . I expect you ll be here for a while you might even come to feel comfortable here . In time , I hope you will become able to walk around as you recover . But you must never enter my study , is that clear ? I promise you that you will have everything you could ever need , but under no circumstances are you to go in there . Do you understand ?", "Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s entire demeanour had turned to ice . Her ($_tsuyu) tone , her ($_tsuyu) distant gaze , her ($_tsuyu) strong shoulders all so unlike her ($_tsuyu) previous warmth . Ochako ($_ochako) nodded . Yes , I understand . \n", "It s no trouble . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s tone left no room for debate . I couldn t just send you out off into the fields in your condition , that would be inhumane . But I will have to ask you to be patient with me while I get what you need . \n", "Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) nodded strangely , as if she ($_tsuyu) had been expecting that answer the whole time . That s pretty rare . I guess I should count myself lucky that I get to meet a living , breathing mage . \n", " I must say , you gave me quite a fright when you arrived . You passed out in my arms , and then I noticed you were bleeding , and Well , you don t need to worry anymore . I managed to do what I could for your injuries , although it wasn t much . I don t mean to pry , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said softly , but you re a soldier , right ? I saw the emblem on your cloak .", " Cath na hAbhann Yuuei . The Battle of River Yuuei . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s first official translation assignment as a member of the resistance .", " Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) tried not to think about it too much , convinced the gravity of the situation would scramble her ($_tsuyu) thoughts , which she ($_tsuyu) needed to be in a state of unmoving calm if this translation was to be useful . The papers , about two dozen of them , had been brought to her ($_tsuyu) by a scrawny messenger boy . Saints , Tsuyu understood that using informal channels was a safer method of transportation of intel , but seeing such a young boy mixed up in this chaos was sickening . She ($_tsuyu) had given him a sweet cake for his efforts , because she ($_tsuyu) had nothing else to give .", "The matter continued to not make sense but Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) tried to think nothing more of it . Among her ($_tsuyu) next assignments was a beautifully written piece of military intel . Ah , so we even have help that far up the chain ... It said the king s closest military leaders were developing a new method of warfare involving a new type of weapon it was supposed to be dropped from the air and create a vast dome . Inside it , all the air would be sucked out , essentially creating a huge vacuum , suffocating everyone inside . \n", "You ($_ochako) saved yourself ($_ochako) , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said , taking Ochako ($_ochako) s wrists and holding them down gently .

It s okay , you ($_ochako) didn t do anything wrong . \n", "Ochako ($_ochako) leaned her ($_ochako) forehead against Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s shoulder for a moment . Thank you ($_ochako) , she ($_ochako) said , over and over , in a quiet , watery voice . \n", " Ochako ($_ochako) whirled on Tsuyu , a dangerous , beastly look in her ($_ochako) eyes . Didn t do anything wrong ? Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , I m a deserter ! I m a coward ! I ran away from a battle where my comrades gave their lives ! I deserve death . I ran away .

But this wasn t the_Academy ($_the) , it ($_the) was its ($_the) antithesis . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) was going against everything she ($_tsuyu) had ever been taught , everything that made her ($_tsuyu) who she ($_tsuyu) was today \n"], "($_ochako)": ["The door to the wardrobe creaked open and Ochako ($_ochako) poked her ($_ochako) head through . Are they gone ? she ($_ochako) asked quietly . \n", "And then there was the question of Ochako , who had been panicked and frazzled at the thought of being found by her ($_ochako) fellow countrymen . She ($_ochako) strode to the guest room and swung open the door . Ochako ($_ochako) , I know you ($_ochako) re in here . \n", " That had been a close call . They had nearly found her ($_ochako) study , and her ($_ochako) work . The only reason she ($_ochako) hadn t been found out was because one soldier out of how many ?", " Tens of thousands ? Hundreds of thousands ? hadn t forgotten how to be human . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) would never be this lucky again . She ($_ochako) needed to either find another place to live and work , or work harder to be secretive .", " We re leaving . And that was that . The two guards ducked their way out of Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s low-ceiling house . Tsuyu curtseyed as they left , because it s all about the details , and let out a deep breath when the door latch clicked . But she ($_ochako) didn t dare move , not yet . Not until she ($_ochako) heard their footsteps dissolve into silence .", "Ochako ($_ochako) started crying silently , big fat tears rolling down her ($_ochako) rosy cheeks . They ll make me go back . I can t go back . \n", "I can see that . Care to explain yourself ? Because I ll have you ($_ochako) know I ll not be harbouring a spy \n", "Yes , they re gone , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) responded , helping Ochako ($_ochako) out of her ($_ochako) curled-up position inside . And you ($_ochako) should have known that they d inspect the wardrobes first . A poor hiding place , indeed . And you ($_ochako) shouldn t be contorting yourself ($_ochako) into postures like that , it ll re-open your ($_ochako) wounds . \n", "I will , sir ($_sir) . Thank you both for your service . And she ($_ochako) meant it . For the younger one , at least . It had been a while since she ($_ochako) met a king s soldier with such compassion . May the Saints keep you . \n", " Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) shuffled all of her ($_ochako) papers into the huge leatherbound tome before her ($_ochako) and shoved it into the nearest shelf . She ($_ochako) fumbled with the key when she ($_ochako) took it from her ($_ochako) skirt pocket and almost dropped it while locking the door . As she ($_ochako) descended the stairs , she ($_ochako) shook her ($_ochako) hair out of its bun and opened the two top buttons of her ($_ochako) dress . A deep breath .", " Calm . They know nothing . And even if they do , they can prove nothing . She ($_ochako) swung open the door .", " Soldiers . Kingsmen . Whatever you wanted to call them , they were here , and Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) wasn t ready . Saints , had they come for Ochako ($_ochako) ? For Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) ? She ($_ochako) prayed it was something else altogether .", "Making a conscious effort to keep her ($_ochako) breathing level , she ($_ochako) smiled and spoke politely . Oh my , I wasn t expecting a visit from two such honourable gentleman . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) cringed internally at the exaggerated sweetness of her ($_ochako) own tone . \n", " Two looming soldiers covered in gleaming armour towered over her ($_ochako) . Although they were the same height , one of them was quite obviously a few years younger than the other .", " The younger one had kind , green eyes and a sweet , crooked grin . He was quite attractive Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) might have even fallen in love with him , if she ($_ochako) had been attracted to men . The older one , however , was likely a veteran . His grey eyes and scarred face spoke of a soul much older than its body . It was clear who had seen combat and who hadn t.", "The days passed quietly as Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) kept writing while Ochako ($_ochako) only awoke for mealtimes . Ochako ($_ochako) was distant whenever Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) spoke with her ($_ochako) , and could therefore not provide anything useful , but Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) assumed it was fatigue from her ($_ochako) recovery . \n", "The calm didn t last , however . It couldn t. Tsuyu was in her ($_ochako) study one evening when she ($_ochako) heard a loud banging on her ($_ochako) front door . So many visitors knocking on my door these days , she ($_ochako) murmured to herself ($_ochako) . Maybe she ($_ochako) should turn the house into a bed and breakfast , or an inn , or \n", "Empty? Was Ochako ($_ochako) not there ? Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) peeked her ($_tsuyu) head around the doorframe as the guard let himself ($_tsuyu) in and slowly turned about the room . The bedsheets were rustled under a sunbeam , but definitely empty . Apart from that , there was no evidence anyone had been in there . \n", "I ve done all I can without raising suspicion . If they find Ochako ($_ochako) , that s her ($_ochako) problem . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) wiped her ($_tsuyu) palms on her ($_tsuyu) skirt and slowly followed the older guard . He ($_tsuyu) turned the handle and ducked his ($_tsuyu) head inside . \n", "Ochako ($_ochako) s breathing began to return to normal . Thank you , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) . \n", " If she hadn t known any better , or if her memory had been wiped clean , Ochako ($_ochako) would have guessed she were in her old room . The cream walls were bathed in a soft , warm light coming from an oil lamp beside her head . Yes , an oil lamp , and a wooden desk , and heavy cotton blankets on top of her . A woman with pale skin and sleek black hair , sleeping quietly in an armchair . Although her eyes were closed , Ochako ($_ochako) could easily tell she was quite beautiful . Her large hands were curled into a shawl she had wrapped around herself and up towards her chest .", " How long have I been like this ? Somehow , the darkness felt like everything there ever was , the only thing that had ever existed but that couldn t be true when Ochako ($_ochako) still had such clear memories of walking and climbing and talking .", " Maybe she ($_ochako) had been in a coma for months , or even years . Maybe when I wake up , the war will be over , and I can go home . Over and over again Ochako ($_ochako) found herself at the brink of consciousness , but every time she was pulled under into the nothingness once again in an infuriating cycle . On the four hundred and twenty-sixth surfacing of her mind , she finally found the strength to crack open her eyes .", "There was nothing . Just darkness all around , stretching on into forever . Ochako ($_ochako) could probably will herself ($_ochako) awake if she ($_ochako) wanted , she ($_ochako) could feel it , but the prospect of having to move and speak and walk was at that moment , it was too much . She ($_ochako) chose to wallow in the darkness a little while longer , content to just lie there until her ($_ochako) strength returned to her ($_ochako) . \n", "Ochako ($_ochako) blinked blearily a few times . Where am I ? Who are you ? \n", "Whoa there! Try not to move too much, okay? You re still injured . The sleeping woman had awoken and brought her chair nearer the bed . She placed a big , warm hand on Ochako ($_ochako) s arm and gave her a friendly smile . \n", "I do beg your pardon , sirs , but I live alone and work from home as a translator . I assure you nothing suspicious has transpired here . She ($_ochako) clasped her ($_ochako) hands coyly in front of her ($_ochako) chest , pulling her ($_ochako) shawl around her ($_ochako) . Her ($_ochako) big eyes always could lure in a good man . \n", " Shit . No use raising suspicion . Not letting her ($_ochako) smile slip for a single second , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) bowed her ($_ochako) head . Of course , I would hate to get in the way . But might I ask you gentleman a small favour ?", " I have a terrible habit of being quite a ditz , so my home is usually left in an awful state . Papers everywhere , ink stains I m sure you understand . She ($_ochako) curled one hand into a small fist and brought it up just in front of her ($_ochako) mouth .", "The younger soldier blushed and pondered her ($_ochako) words for a moment , and then said , I think that would be agreeable . \n", "Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) darted into Ochako ($_ochako) s room , glad to see the patient was awake . Who s at the door ? she ($_tsuyu) asked quietly . \n", "I oblige presently . Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) showed the two guards the back rooms , which returned nothing suspicious . She ($_tsuyu) looked over her ($_tsuyu) shoulder a few times at the door to the guest room , watching for any signs of Ochako ($_ochako) . \n", "I should go . Ochako ($_ochako) whispered . Then you ($_ochako) wouldn t be in any danger . You ($_ochako) d have nothing to hide . \n", "No . N mhealltar an sionnach faoi dh . You ($_ochako) can t fool the fox twice . \n", " Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) swallowed . Throwing you ($_ochako) out prematurely would do you ($_ochako) more harm than good . You ($_ochako) have to heal completely before you ($_ochako) leave , or else your ($_ochako) weakened body would just break down completely . Don t forget you ($_ochako) ve exhausted your ($_ochako) supply of magic as well as your ($_ochako) stores of energy . Staying here won t be a problem . We ll deal with the searches when they happen .", "Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s entire demeanour had turned to ice . Her ($_tsuyu) tone , her ($_tsuyu) distant gaze , her ($_tsuyu) strong shoulders all so unlike her ($_tsuyu) previous warmth . Ochako ($_ochako) nodded . Yes , I understand . \n", "Ochako ($_ochako) swallowed hard . I m not a soldier . I m a mage . \n", "You ($_ochako) saved yourself ($_ochako) , Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) said , taking Ochako ($_ochako) s wrists and holding them down gently . You ($_ochako) did what any human being would do based on instinct . You ($_ochako) didn t choose to go to war , you ($_ochako) were conscripted . It s okay , you ($_ochako) didn t do anything wrong . \n", "Ochako ($_ochako) leaned her ($_ochako) forehead against Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) s shoulder for a moment . Thank you ($_ochako) , she ($_ochako) said , over and over , in a quiet , watery voice . \n", "It s okay , Ochako ($_ochako) , you ($_ochako) didn t do anything wrong . \n", " Ochako ($_ochako) whirled on Tsuyu , a dangerous , beastly look in her ($_ochako) eyes . Didn t do anything wrong ? Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , I m a deserter ! I m a coward ! I ran away from a battle where my comrades gave their lives ! I deserve death . I ran away . She ($_ochako) began tugging on her ($_ochako) hair and drumming her ($_ochako) fists against her ($_ochako) skull .", "Until you ($_ochako) found some help . Until you ($_ochako) found here . \n", "Oh , Saints . Another young one caught up in that king s great game . You ($_ochako) re not just a Royal Mage . You ($_ochako) were put on the front lines . \n", "Ochako ($_ochako) , I know you ($_ochako) re upset , but we need to find a long-term solution for this . Guards never raid just once . They always come back , and when they do , I don t know if I ll be able to protect you ($_ochako) . \n", "More loud knocks , but too far away to matter to Tsuyu . No-one avoided soldiers like this unless they had something to hide . Ochako ($_ochako) , what are you ($_don) hiding from me ? \n", "Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , please ! Ochako ($_ochako) was sitting up now , pulling her ($_ochako) blanket up to her ($_ochako) chest as if it could somehow protect her ($_ochako) . \n", "Tsuyu ($_tsuyu) , you ($_tsuyu) can t tell them I m here . Ochako ($_ochako) s tone was sharp . \n"]}
