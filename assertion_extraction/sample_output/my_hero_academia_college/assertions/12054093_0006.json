Breathing deeply through his ($_midoriya) mouth , Midoriya ($_midoriya) quietly swallowed the ball of anger as his ($_midoriya) feet lead him ($_midoriya) to the kitchens . \n", "Inko ($_inko) nodded her ($_inko) head and turned to part the locks of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s hair that hid his ($_inko) forehead before planting a gentle kiss upon the skin . She ($_inko) bade him ($_inko) to rest once Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) healed him ($_inko) , something he ($_inko) promised her ($_inko) he ($_inko) would do , before watching his ($_inko) mother leave the room . \n", "His ($_inko) gaze flickered over to All Might , who stared at the door after his ($_inko) mother left . There was a peculiar emotion upon his ($_inko) face that Midoriya ($_midoriya) had never seen before ; he ($_inko) no longer wore his ($_inko) iconic smile , but instead , there was a dour look on his ($_inko) face . \n", "When they had come to Recovery Girl s office , she had seemed to glow at All Might s appearance , a friendly and familiar look passing between them , but that quickly fell when she saw Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms and ordered Yaoyorozu out . Midoriya ($_midoriya) had been surprised at the woman s sharp tongue as she lashed out at All_Might ($_all) as she examined his ($_midoriya) arms , gingerly taking them into her wrinkled hands and lightly pressing on the flesh as Midoriya ($_midoriya) let out hisses between clenched teeth . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) slightly turned his ($_midoriya) head as the door to Recovery Girl s office , swung open . The wood hitting the wall beside it with an audible smack , before Midoriya ($_midoriya) s mother rushed into the room . Worry caused her features to seem just a little older as her gaze settled upon his injuries , causing her skin to pale and a deep frown to tug at the corner of her lips . As she rushed over to him , she shared a knowing look with All_Might ($_all) as she quickly grabbed one of her son s arms , but let it drop limply to his sides as his pallor turned even lighter from the shock of pain . \n", "The blush on All Might s cheeks got deeper . Out in the woods , Midoriya ($_midoriya) had tapped a little too deeply into the well that was One for All ; he still wasn t used to utilizing the_Quirk ($_the) at all , despite the stamina and strength training that All_Might ($_all) had put him through leading up to his departure , he had only had a little bit of time with the_man ($_midoriya) to focus on the abilities of the_Quirk ($_the) after all . As a result , his arms had ended up like what he was forced to stare at . \n", "Worry had scintillated into All Might s eyes at the appearance of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms and he had quickly tossed the boy onto his horse , rode back into the outskirts of the city , returned the horses and rushed back into the gardens from the secret passageway they had taken before . All_Might ($_all) had yelled for Yaoyorozu , the knight rushing around the corner from where she had been standing earlier . There had been a scowl on her face , no doubt she had been looking all over the gardens for the two of them ; her scowl deepened once she saw Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms , suspicion draped her face like a widow s veil . \n", "Reaching out , All_Might ($_all) placed his hand on Inko ($_inko) s shoulder , giving it ($_inko) a reassuring pat as he lifted his head to stare into her eyes . Don ($_don) t worry yourself sick , Inko ($_inko) . I ll look over Midoriya ($_midoriya) for you . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned slightly as a passionate look seemed to pass between them one that he ($_midoriya) had never noticed before as All_Might ($_all) squeezed her ($_midoriya) shoulder lightly , before letting his ($_midoriya) hand slip from her ($_midoriya) shoulder . Something in Midoriya ($_midoriya) stirred with unease as All Might s touch just seemed to have lingered for a few moments too long than what was usually appropriate . He ($_midoriya) shook his ($_midoriya) head and chose to squash down the unease , simply chalking his ($_midoriya) emotions up to a tumultuous day . \n", " Shaking his head , Midoriya ($_midoriya) attempted to conciliate her fears and worry . It s fine , Mom . I just ended up overexerting myself today and tripped down some stairs when I wasn t paying attention .", "But for just a few days , he ($_midoriya) was going to get a reprieve from all of that . Letting a sigh pass his ($_midoriya) lips , he ($_midoriya) allowed his ($_midoriya) shoulders to slacken as the warm rays of the sun-soaked into his ($_midoriya) skin . Standing in the courtyard , beside the_prince ($_the) , Midoriya ($_midoriya) let his ($_midoriya) eyes flicker over the carriages that slowly rolled along the cobblestones as foreign leaders and nobles from distant lands stepped out of the carries , servants flocking to their sides to attend to their needs and fetch their luggage . The_prince ($_the) greeted them one by one , until joy flickered in Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes as he ($_midoriya) saw a black and gold carriage , it ($_midoriya) was decorated with flowers that were native to Shuei and grew in the more mountainous regions ; the petals were pink with a slight tinge of yellow in the center , a flower that was made up of thousands of petals with some that curled inward toward the flower . \n", "With every passing day , Midoriya ($_midoriya) was eager to just return to his ($_midoriya) warm and peaceful country of Shuei . He ($_midoriya) was tired of Enten ; of the mind games that were played here as frequently as the board games of his ($_midoriya) childhood , of the culture here , of the tight thread he ($_midoriya) was walking on within the court . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) s features twisted into a dark look at Midoriya ($_midoriya) s words . The anger that coursed through Midoriya ($_midoriya) s veins found liquid ice flowing through them instead as fear settled into its place in his body . The green-haired teen could smell the thick stench of burning wood in the room . His eyes flitted to the chair Todoroki ($_todoroki) sat in and he watched as a thin , plume of smoke curled upward from the arm of the chair to the ceiling . \n", " No , Midoriya ($_midoriya) shook his ($_midoriya) head , his ($_midoriya) green curls slightly swaying . I can t compare you to All Might because there is nothing to compare . You re nothing like him ($_midoriya) and I m glad you aren t. All Might is kind , trustworthy and warm . You re cold , insufferable and seek to keep people at an arm s length . No , you re nothing like All Might at all , but you sure as hell are similar to your father", "Two months passed since that_incident_in_Todoroki ($_todoroki) Todoroki ($_todoroki) s bedroom and Midoriya ($_midoriya) felt that there had been a subtle shift in their relationship . Instead of growing warmer , it ($_todoroki) had grown cold . He ($_todoroki) awoke in the morning , served the_prince ($_the) , clothed him ($_todoroki) , bathed him ($_todoroki) , fetched him ($_todoroki) his ($_todoroki) meals and the only words that passed his ($_todoroki) lips were : Yes , your highness . \n", "His words weren t a question , but from the heat , Midoriya ($_midoriya) felt building upon his ($_midoriya) face , he ($_midoriya) nodded his ($_midoriya) headed . Yes. \n", "Mother ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) called out toward his ($_midoriya) mother 's back , he ($_midoriya) was slightly surprised to see her in this corner of the castle as he ($_midoriya) was on his ($_midoriya) way to fetch the_prince ($_the) his ($_midoriya) lunch . The woman jumped slightly as she pulled a wooden door shut . Narrowing his ($_midoriya) eyes , his ($_midoriya) gaze flickered from his ($_midoriya) mother s back to the door then back to his ($_midoriya) mother again . \n", "Rushing over to her , a grim look settled on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s features . Is there something wrong with All_Might ($_all) ? He ($_midoriya) hastily whispered to his ($_midoriya) mother who shook her head . \n", "He ($_midoriya) s fine . She patted her hand against her son s arm , attempting to placate him ($_midoriya) . Although he ($_midoriya) s getting weaker with each passing day . He ($_midoriya) s fine . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned at her ($_midoriya) words , his ($_midoriya) eyes studying the new grey hairs that seemed to be cropping up on his ($_midoriya) mother s scalp to the appearance of wrinkles around the corners of her ($_midoriya) eyes . It felt like there was more his ($_midoriya) mother wasn t saying ; her ($_midoriya) appearance in the hall that contained All Might s room was anomalous , she ($_midoriya) was a royal scholar , a position that he ($_midoriya) knew offered her ($_midoriya) some degree of closeness with their leader as she ($_midoriya) had to report directly to All Might and at times had to confirm with him ($_midoriya) depending upon the nature of her ($_midoriya) work . But her ($_midoriya) room was on the other side of the castle and he ($_midoriya) knew his ($_midoriya) mother wouldn t make the trip to All Might s room unless it was completely necessary . \n", "Are you sure , mother ? If something is wrong with him ($_midoriya) , I can help . \n", "Surprise widened his ($_midoriya) mother s eyes , as an appreciative grin stretched across her ($_midoriya) face . Patting his ($_midoriya) arm with a warming gesture , she ($_midoriya) nodded her ($_midoriya) head . I know , you can . But for now , I have everything covered and you shouldn t worry yourself , instead focus on your current duties . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) nodded , despite the reassurance from his ($_midoriya) mother , he ($_midoriya) couldn t help but feel doubt settle into the empty space of his ($_midoriya) gut as he ($_midoriya) assured her that he ($_midoriya) would try to find some time in the evening to share a meal with her before running off to the kitchens and fetching the_prince ($_the) s dinner . \n", "As he ($_midoriya) set down the tray on the_prince ($_the) s table , there was a soft knock on the door before Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) poked her ($_yaoyorozu) head inside the bedroom . Midoriya ($_midoriya) , All_Might ($_all) wishes to speak with you in the gardens . \n", "His ($_midoriya) brows lifted in surprise that Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) came out of her ($_yaoyorozu) way to inform him ($_midoriya) that All Might wished to speak with him ($_midoriya) in the gardens , he ($_midoriya) supposed it was the_prince ($_the) s way of telling him ($_midoriya) that he ($_midoriya) would have some degree of freedom , but not much . Nodding , Midoriya ($_midoriya) walked away from the table and out of the room , the female knight only walking a few feet behind him ($_midoriya) as they walked through long corridors and out into the open air to reach the castle gardens . Even at night , the flowers here glowed with an ethereal beauty so that they served as a source of light in the gardens that had been built in such a way that guests could easily traverse the grounds without the use of a lantern or their Quirks . \n", "Not what you were expecting ? Laughing away the embarrassment that colored his ($_midoriya) face , the woman had motioned for him ($_midoriya) to take the low stool that had been placed beside her . Midoriya ($_midoriya) made his ($_midoriya) way over to the stool , noticing the syringe-like cane the woman had propped up against the arm of her chair . Her eyes raked over his ($_midoriya) broken nose and the black and green bruises that were already forming against his ($_midoriya) skin . \n", "The door to her office swung shut behind him ($_midoriya) , leaving his ($_midoriya) standing there with a piece of candy in his ($_midoriya) palm and his ($_midoriya) eyes still wide with shock . \n", " You ($_toshinori) . Young man , lifting her syringe shaped cane , Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) smacked Midoriya ($_midoriya) in the shin with it , earning her a wince of pain from the green haired-boy who looked just about ready to black out from the pain his nearly broken arms were giving him . Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) fixed All Might with a withering stare , her lips flattened out into a thin line . I can t believe you ($_toshinori) , Toshinori ($_toshinori) . Not only do you ($_toshinori) make the poor boy like this , but you ($_toshinori) send him back to my office when he just nearly left . Not to mention I can see every muscle in your ($_toshinori) body trembling just to keep your ($_toshinori) form like that .", "All_Might ($_all) stood sheepishly beside Midoriya ($_midoriya) , a blush of embarrassment staining his cheeks as he kept his gaze pointed to the floor in order to not stare into the older woman s eyes . \n", "The grin on All_Might ($_all) s face only seemed to grow bigger , just like it had back in the gardens when he ($_midoriya) had pushed apart the hedges near the fountain to reveal a secret path that lead from the castle to the outskirts of the city . \n", "What are we doing out here ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes took in the wide expanse of the forest just a few miles away from the castle . Near the edge of the forest , he ($_midoriya) could hear the horses All_Might ($_all) had asked him ($_midoriya) to purchase from a stable hand neighing as they chomped down on the lush grass , happy to take a short reprieve from their brisk journey . \n", "Something to cheer you up ! All Might s boisterous personality more voluminous than the forest before them . Strength training ! His ($_midoriya) grin was blinding as he ($_midoriya) pointed to the fallen logs just a few feet away , a few of the logs had been split into quarters , but their impressive size still would need the strength of at least two men in order to haul them to a pile of logs that were just a few feet away . \n", "Just a secret between you and me . He ($_midoriya) had quietly told Midoriya ($_midoriya) before steering him ($_midoriya) into the parting made by the two hedges , All Might following closely behind him ($_midoriya) until the hedges swallowed up All_Might ($_all) s large frame . \n", "The blank look on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face quickly had All Might holding up his ($_midoriya) hands as a sweat droplet careened down from his ($_midoriya) temple to his ($_midoriya) cheek . Fear not , young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) , you re going to use One for All to split the logs that already haven t been broken down and then use it to increase the natural strength in your arms and legs to carry the logs you ve split and the already split ones over to the pile . Giving him ($_midoriya) a thumbs up , All Might s grin swayed Midoriya ($_midoriya) s apprehension a little . Don ($_don) t worry . Don ($_don) t worry . You ($_toshinori) ll do fine . \n", "Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) clucked her tongue as she closely examined the bruised and blackened form of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms . \n", "Sighing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) rolled up the sleeves of his ($_midoriya) shirt that he ($_midoriya) wore underneath his ($_midoriya) vest as he ($_midoriya) closed his ($_midoriya) eyes , he ($_midoriya) let One for All slowly rise to the surface of his ($_midoriya) skin and breathed deeply . \n", "However , each step Midoriya ($_midoriya) took that would eventually place him before the_prince ($_the) s door , lead to the enmity that he swallowed down just moments earlier rearing its head to the surface . It was a slumbering beast that had awoken from its nap and , despite being satiated with food and drink , could only be kept at bay for so long . Midoriya ($_midoriya) pushed open the door to the prince s room to find the young man sitting at the table , an expectant look upon his ($_midoriya) face . He ($_midoriya) watched him ($_midoriya) ; watched as Todoroki s eyes flickered to the droplets of dried blood upon his ($_midoriya) tunic , before slipping upward to his ($_midoriya) face where Midoriya ($_midoriya) could see beneath those two different colored eyes , a look of indifference as if Todoroki ($_todoroki) was indifferent to the fact that he ($_midoriya) nearly could have gotten Midoriya ($_midoriya) injured or worse . \n", "Chef ($_chef) thrusted a tray that Midoriya ($_midoriya) hadn t seen into his ($_midoriya) hands , piled high with tiny watercress sandwiches and a pot of tea . The_prince ($_the) s lunch , the Chef merely told him ($_midoriya) , before pushing back out the door and up the steps that lead away from the kitchen without so much as a single word . \n", "You re angry , he ($_midoriya) simply stated those two words as as neither a question or a subtle observation , but a plain fact . And you look like you have something to say . \n", "Your lunch , Midoriya ($_midoriya) pronounced glumly as he ($_midoriya) entered the room and set the tray down on the table , before taking a step away and clasping his ($_midoriya) hands behind his ($_midoriya) back . As Todoroki ($_todoroki) reached out , grabbing the handle of the delicate teacup between his ($_midoriya) fingers , he ($_midoriya) cocked an eyebrow in Midoriya ($_midoriya) s direction . \n", "You do . Todoroki ($_todoroki) took a sip of his ($_midoriya) tea , a clearly disinterested look burning in his ($_midoriya) eyes , And I ($_midoriya) m telling you to freely speak your mind . \n", "I don t , your highness . He ($_midoriya) bit down on the inside of his ($_midoriya) cheek , he ($_midoriya) could taste the bitter edge of his ($_midoriya) emotions upon the tip of his ($_midoriya) tongue . \n", " Lifting a single finger , the_prince ($_the) pointed at him ($_midoriya) . Despite any words of placation you re attempting to fish out after years of dedicated flattery to All Might .", " I ($_midoriya) am not him ($_midoriya) , and let me ($_midoriya) tell you that you are ; you re angry , as angry as any human being can get . His ($_midoriya) eyes were the smoldering remnants of a fire that had just been doused out of existence .", " What was the first thing I ($_midoriya) told you when you became a part of my ($_midoriya) house ? If I ($_midoriya) wanted a servant who wouldn t speak their mind freely , I ($_midoriya) would get one of my ($_midoriya) father s servants and be content to listen to another tell me ($_midoriya) half-truths and prettily worded lies in order to appease me ($_midoriya) . So again , Midoriya ($_midoriya) , speak your mind . Or would you have rather that I ($_midoriya) didn t have Momo ($_momo) come to save you yesterday on my ($_midoriya) orders ?", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) s lips parted , a protest fluttering to the tip of his ($_midoriya) tongue , but Todoroki ($_todoroki) cut him ($_midoriya) off with a wave of his ($_midoriya) hand , placed his ($_midoriya) cup of tea back down on the tray and fixed his ($_midoriya) gaze on the servant . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) lifted his ($_todoroki) teacup yet again , the liquid still steaming within the ceramic mug . Momo ($_momo) reported to me ($_midoriya) before your little scuffle in the halls with the_Commander ($_the) , that some of the guards within the castle were seeking to get retribution against me ($_midoriya) for humiliating them by attacking you . A little eye for an eye treatment , so I ($_midoriya) simply ordered her to keep an eye on you . \n", " You ve gotten taller . She ($_inko) noted , before a single sniffle saw tears spilling from her ($_inko) eyes . Are you eating ? How have you been ? Are you making sure to get enough rest ? His ($_midoriya) mother rattled off more than a million questions per second causing him ($_midoriya) to laugh and reassure her ($_inko) that he ($_midoriya) was indeed looking after his ($_midoriya) own health ; a clearing of Todoroki ($_todoroki) s throat had his ($_midoriya) mother fixing her ($_inko) gaze upon the prince once her ($_inko) rambling ended . Wiping tears from her ($_inko) eyes , Inko ($_inko) let her ($_inko) hands drop from her ($_inko) son s shoulder to fold themselves in her ($_inko) waist , she ($_inko) bowed to him ($_midoriya) .", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes went wide as he spotted another figure coming out of the carriage . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) ! Inko ($_inko) called out , before rushing to All Might s side and imploring the man to drop Izuku ($_izuku) down to the ground so she ($_inko) could hug her ($_inko) own son . All_Might ($_all) complied , settling Midoriya ($_midoriya) back on his ($_midoriya) feet before his ($_midoriya) mother was pulling him ($_midoriya) into a hug that caused him ($_midoriya) to slightly bend his ($_midoriya) frame so that he ($_midoriya) could hug his ($_midoriya) mother who was now slightly shorter than him ($_midoriya) . She ($_inko) noted the difference too as she ($_inko) pulled away from him ($_midoriya) at arm s length . \n", "Unable to help himself , a smile stretched across Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face as he watched the straw mats of the carriage get pushed to the side as All Might s hulking frame stepped out of the carriage and into the open air of the courtyard wearing a black coat that sported the crest of Shuei ($_shuei) on the shoulders and back , a black kimono was underneath it with a pair of grey pants tied around the man s large waist with a white belt . He looked imposing in such a simple , plain outfit ; the air around him gave off the sense that he was a man who shouldn t be trifled with despite the calm , approachable aura around him . \n", "Laughing , All_Might ($_all) rushed toward Midoriya ($_midoriya) , sweeping the young teen up into his strong arms before pulling him into a tight hug that caused Midoriya ($_midoriya) to go red in the face as All Might s arms squeezed the life out of him . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) s mother once told him ($_midoriya) the reason the flower had become such a common symbol to Shuei was due to its everblooming appearance , a flower that despite harsh weather and the changing of seasons never lost its beauty or petals , just like how Shuei ($_shuei) would never lose the other symbol of its nation their leader . The carriage doors were made up of folded mats that were made from rice straw , the carriage was pulled by two large , black oxen that were bridled with strong , red rope . \n", "Stopping just a few feet away from where Midoriya ($_midoriya) stood , a loud shout pierced the air that was already thick with noise , the huff and neighs of the animals that had pulled the carriages to the castle and servants that were bustling around to attend to the nobles and leaders that had come for Todoroki ($_todoroki) s coming of age celebrations . Midoriya ($_midoriya) , my boy ! The loud shout caused everyone to become startled by the noise , servants and guests alike stopped in their tracks to swivel their heads toward the source of the noise . \n", " Taking a deep breath , Midoriya ($_midoriya) attempted to quell the anger that was slowly bubbling in his ($_midoriya) chest . Reaching up with the back of his ($_midoriya) hand , he ($_midoriya) rubbed at the wet remnants of saliva that covered his ($_midoriya) right cheek . Droplets of dried blood still coated the collar and front of his ($_midoriya) tunic but his ($_midoriya) nose and all other injuries he ($_midoriya) had sustained in his ($_midoriya) match with the_Commander ($_the) had been healed by Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) . He ($_midoriya) had been surprised to find a short , elderly woman sitting at a desk piled high with herbs and still bubbling potions when he ($_midoriya) had entered the little room that was connected to the infirmary . Instead of an elderly woman he ($_midoriya) had been expecting at least a young girl around his ($_midoriya) age or slightly older as the woman s name had seemed to imply . The shock on his ($_midoriya) face had been apparent as the old woman had let out a sharp , girlish laugh causing the syringe stuck in her hair as an ornament to bob .", "There , all better , Recovery_Girl ($_recovery) uttered cheerfully as her lips distended back to her face . Midoriya ($_midoriya) simply stared at her , frozen in shock as the old woman made a huffing noise , reached out for one of his ($_midoriya) hands , turned it so that his ($_midoriya) palm was facing upward and deposited a wrapped piece of candy within it before getting one of her assistants to usher him ($_midoriya) out of the room . \n", "Chef ($_chef) laughed at the overwhelmed look upon Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , pushing himself ($_midoriya) through the small throng that surrounded the green-haired teen something that was an easy task with his ($_midoriya) large frame the_man ($_midoriya) scolded the servants to gather and return to their respective duties . No one s going to eat today if you don t get back to your work . Leave the poor boy alone , I m sure he s tired from that match with the_Commander ($_the) . A grumble rose among the servants as they reluctantly went back to their duties . \n", "Huffing_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) rolled his ($_midoriya) eyes . Well , I never thought anyone could be a huge insufferable ass until I met him ($_midoriya) . \n", "Humming at that , All_Might ($_all) stopped and laid a single hand on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulder . The contact was warm , gentle and fatherly in nature . There was something soft and reassuring in All Might s eyes as he ($_midoriya) looked down at Midoriya ($_midoriya) . \n", "Letting a smile tug at the corner of his lips due to the infectious , positive nature of the man next to him , Midoriya ($_midoriya) slightly shook his ($_midoriya) head . No , it doesn t seem like we will and I doubt the_prince ($_the) would seeing as how he ($_midoriya) s had someone watching my every move since I ve been here . \n", "Giving a simple nod of her head , she gestured for All_Might ($_all) and Midoriya ($_midoriya) to walk in front of her .

Tiny little parts of the bud would shed and float into the air , carried away by gusts of wind to find new ground on which to germinate . \n", "Patting Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulder reassuringly with a gentle , understanding smile , All_Might ($_all) gave him ($_midoriya) a bit of advice .

That name you called the king earlier , Endeavor ($_endeavor) , why did you refer to him with it ($_endeavor) ? \n", "Midoriya_,_my_boy ($_midoriya) , come with me , All_Might ($_all) whispered softly , his ($_midoriya) grip on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulder tightening as he ($_midoriya) silently steered the boy towards a fountain that had been placed between a set of thick hedges . \n", "His face must have paled at the memory as he was shaken out of his thoughts by All Might s light touch upon his shoulder . The usual coruscating smile upon All_Might ($_all) s face was a pale shadow of the usual gleam and cheerfulness that always surrounded him . In this moment , he looked less like a leader who could inspire the masses with a flash of pearly white teeth , but a parent showing concern over the drastic change of mood occurring within their child . \n", "When they had come to Recovery Girl s office , she had seemed to glow at All Might s appearance , a friendly and familiar look passing between them , but that quickly fell when she saw Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms and ordered Yaoyorozu out . Midoriya ($_midoriya) had been surprised at the woman s sharp tongue as she lashed out at All_Might ($_all) as she examined his ($_midoriya) arms , gingerly taking them into her wrinkled hands and lightly pressing on the flesh as Midoriya ($_midoriya) let out hisses between clenched teeth . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) slightly turned his ($_midoriya) head as the door to Recovery Girl s office , swung open . The wood hitting the wall beside it with an audible smack , before Midoriya ($_midoriya) s mother rushed into the room . Worry caused her features to seem just a little older as her gaze settled upon his injuries , causing her skin to pale and a deep frown to tug at the corner of her lips . As she rushed over to him , she shared a knowing look with All_Might ($_all) as she quickly grabbed one of her son s arms , but let it drop limply to his sides as his pallor turned even lighter from the shock of pain . \n", "The blush on All Might s cheeks got deeper . Out in the woods , Midoriya ($_midoriya) had tapped a little too deeply into the well that was One for All ; he still wasn t used to utilizing the_Quirk ($_the) at all , despite the stamina and strength training that All_Might ($_all) had put him through leading up to his departure , he had only had a little bit of time with the_man ($_midoriya) to focus on the abilities of the_Quirk ($_the) after all . As a result , his arms had ended up like what he was forced to stare at . \n", "Worry had scintillated into All Might s eyes at the appearance of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms and he had quickly tossed the boy onto his horse , rode back into the outskirts of the city , returned the horses and rushed back into the gardens from the secret passageway they had taken before . All_Might ($_all) had yelled for Yaoyorozu , the knight rushing around the corner from where she had been standing earlier . There had been a scowl on her face , no doubt she had been looking all over the gardens for the two of them ; her scowl deepened once she saw Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms , suspicion draped her face like a widow s veil . \n", "Reaching out , All_Might ($_all) placed his hand on Inko ($_inko) s shoulder , giving it ($_inko) a reassuring pat as he lifted his head to stare into her eyes . Don ($_don) t worry yourself sick , Inko ($_inko) . I ll look over Midoriya ($_midoriya) for you . \n", "Midoriya ($_midoriya) frowned slightly as a passionate look seemed to pass between them one that he ($_midoriya) had never noticed before as All_Might ($_all) squeezed her ($_midoriya) shoulder lightly , before letting his ($_midoriya) hand slip from her ($_midoriya) shoulder . Something in Midoriya ($_midoriya) stirred with unease as All Might s touch just seemed to have lingered for a few moments too long than what was usually appropriate . He ($_midoriya) shook his ($_midoriya) head and chose to squash down the unease , simply chalking his ($_midoriya) emotions up to a tumultuous day . \n", "Rushing over to her , a grim look settled on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s features . Is there something wrong with All_Might ($_all) ? He ($_midoriya) hastily whispered to his ($_midoriya) mother who shook her head . \n", "As he ($_midoriya) set down the tray on the_prince ($_the) s table , there was a soft knock on the door before Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) poked her ($_yaoyorozu) head inside the bedroom . Midoriya ($_midoriya) , All_Might ($_all) wishes to speak with you in the gardens . \n", "All_Might ($_all) stood sheepishly beside Midoriya ($_midoriya) , a blush of embarrassment staining his cheeks as he kept his gaze pointed to the floor in order to not stare into the older woman s eyes . \n", "The grin on All_Might ($_all) s face only seemed to grow bigger , just like it had back in the gardens when he ($_midoriya) had pushed apart the hedges near the fountain to reveal a secret path that lead from the castle to the outskirts of the city . \n", "What are we doing out here ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes took in the wide expanse of the forest just a few miles away from the castle . Near the edge of the forest , he ($_midoriya) could hear the horses All_Might ($_all) had asked him ($_midoriya) to purchase from a stable hand neighing as they chomped down on the lush grass , happy to take a short reprieve from their brisk journey . \n", "Just a secret between you and me . He ($_midoriya) had quietly told Midoriya ($_midoriya) before steering him ($_midoriya) into the parting made by the two hedges , All Might following closely behind him ($_midoriya) until the hedges swallowed up All_Might ($_all) s large frame . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) ! Inko ($_inko) called out , before rushing to All Might s side and imploring the man to drop Izuku ($_izuku) down to the ground so she ($_inko) could hug her ($_inko) own son . All_Might ($_all) complied , settling Midoriya ($_midoriya) back on his ($_midoriya) feet before his ($_midoriya) mother was pulling him ($_midoriya) into a hug that caused him ($_midoriya) to slightly bend his ($_midoriya) frame so that he ($_midoriya) could hug his ($_midoriya) mother who was now slightly shorter than him ($_midoriya) . She ($_inko) noted the difference too as she ($_inko) pulled away from him ($_midoriya) at arm s length . \n", "Laughing , All_Might ($_all) rushed toward Midoriya ($_midoriya) , sweeping the young teen up into his strong arms before pulling him into a tight hug that caused Midoriya ($_midoriya) to go red in the face as All Might s arms squeezed the life out of him . \n", "Humming at that , All_Might ($_all) stopped and laid a single hand on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulder . The contact was warm , gentle and fatherly in nature . There was something soft and reassuring in All Might s eyes as he ($_midoriya) looked down at Midoriya ($_midoriya) . \n", "Giving a simple nod of her head , she gestured for All_Might ($_all) and Midoriya ($_midoriya) to walk in front of her . They did , putting a good number of feet between them and her , All Might clucked his tongue against his teeth . \n", "As Midoriya ($_midoriya) examined the flower , a sharp laugh behind him ($_midoriya) caused he ($_midoriya) and Yaoyorozu ($_yaoyorozu) to look in the direction of the sound . All_Might ($_all) , having changed out of his ($_midoriya) clothes for a simple bright yellow yukata , descended down the few steps into the gardens . His ($_midoriya) eyes flickering to Yaoyorozu . \n", "Patting Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulder reassuringly with a gentle , understanding smile , All_Might ($_all) gave him ($_midoriya) a bit of advice . I m sure the_prince ($_the) will warm up to you . You must simply give it some time . After all , his father and I were like the two of you when we were your age . \n"], "($_don)": ["Reaching out , All_Might ($_all) placed his hand on Inko ($_inko) s shoulder , giving it ($_inko) a reassuring pat as he lifted his head to stare into her eyes .

Fear not , young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) , you re going to use One for All to split the logs that already haven t been broken down and then use it to increase the natural strength in your arms and legs to carry the logs you ve split and the already split ones over to the pile .

You ($_toshinori) ll do fine . \n"], "($_todoroki)": ["Out! Todoroki ($_todoroki) barked out the single order , causing the servants to jump slightly . The eldest one s eyes flickered to Midoriya s face , raking over the features distorted by anger , before quickly bowing to the prince and shutting the bedroom door . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) scoffed , as if such a question was naive , imbecilic at best . Of course I ($_midoriya) knew . It would have been ridiculous for me ($_midoriya) to not know what s going on against me ($_midoriya) or my ($_midoriya) house . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) narrowed his ($_todoroki) eyes as he ($_todoroki) took another sip of his ($_todoroki) tea . There it is . There was a sneer on the edge of his ($_todoroki) words . Why don t you let all of that anger out . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) blinked , reclining back into his chair , he stared at the whitewashed bricks on the wall . Have you already forgotten your position ? A foreigner serving in the court of a prince as his personal servant . Especially one that s served as the page of said foreign nation s king . You don t exactly give me many reasons to trust you . \n", "All_Might ($_all) nodded in thanks as Todoroki ($_todoroki) motioned for a servant to come rushing to his side , before instructing them to show All_Might ($_all) and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s mother to spare rooms . Midoriya ($_midoriya) whispered hasty goodbyes to the both of them , before promising his ($_midoriya) mother that he ($_midoriya) would visit her when he ($_midoriya) found time to do so . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) s fingers were slightly shaking as he slowly placed down the teacup in his hand back onto the tray . Are you finished ? His words were steady and calm , despite the raging fire that burned within his eyes and the slight tremor of his fingers . \n", "Todoroki ($_todoroki) s features twisted into a dark look at Midoriya ($_midoriya) s words . The anger that coursed through Midoriya ($_midoriya) s veins found liquid ice flowing through them instead as fear settled into its place in his body . The green-haired teen could smell the thick stench of burning wood in the room . His eyes flitted to the chair Todoroki ($_todoroki) sat in and he watched as a thin , plume of smoke curled upward from the arm of the chair to the ceiling . \n", "Two months passed since that_incident_in_Todoroki ($_todoroki) Todoroki ($_todoroki) s bedroom and Midoriya ($_midoriya) felt that there had been a subtle shift in their relationship . Instead of growing warmer , it ($_todoroki) had grown cold . He ($_todoroki) awoke in the morning , served the_prince ($_the) , clothed him ($_todoroki) , bathed him ($_todoroki) , fetched him ($_todoroki) his ($_todoroki) meals and the only words that passed his ($_todoroki) lips were : Yes , your highness . \n", "Good , Todoroki ($_todoroki) took a deep breath , his ($_todoroki) eyes shutting closed as he ($_todoroki) turned his ($_todoroki) gaze away from the servant s face .

It was a slumbering beast that had awoken from its nap and , despite being satiated with food and drink , could only be kept at bay for so long . Midoriya ($_midoriya) pushed open the door to the prince s room to find the young man sitting at the table , an expectant look upon his ($_midoriya) face . He ($_midoriya) watched him ($_midoriya) ; watched as Todoroki s eyes flickered to the droplets of dried blood upon his ($_midoriya) tunic , before slipping upward to his ($_midoriya) face where Midoriya ($_midoriya) could see beneath those two different colored eyes , a look of indifference as if Todoroki ($_todoroki) was indifferent to the fact that he ($_midoriya) nearly could have gotten Midoriya ($_midoriya) injured or worse . \n", "Your lunch , Midoriya ($_midoriya) pronounced glumly as he ($_midoriya) entered the room and set the tray down on the table , before taking a step away and clasping his ($_midoriya) hands behind his ($_midoriya) back .
