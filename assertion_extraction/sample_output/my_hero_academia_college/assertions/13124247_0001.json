Boisterous dwarves hurl pints back and forth at each other , there s a mage in the corner desperately trying to hawk her goods , by the front door is a pickpocket with a disarmingly cute smile . In short , it s the typical type of tavern you d find in the Main City , where money is rampant , and crime more so . The name Main_City ($_city) is a misnomer , the_city ($_city) is hardly situated in the middle of the country , nor is it ($_city) the most populous city , but this is the_main_city_because_it_is_the_Main_City ($_the) the_Main_City ($_the) . \n"], "($_eijirou)": ["You thought he d wear it !

He ($_eijirou) resolves instead for an unhappy glare and a puff of smoke that escapes his ($_eijirou) mouth . Oh , c'mon man , you don t need to flaunt your half-dragon heritage . \n", " Eijirou ($_eijirou) snorts . You know I ve memorised your scent by now . And I know you know that you he ($_katsuki) points accusingly to the tooth he ($_katsuki) wears around his ($_katsuki) neck . You dropped that on purpose . You re a moron ! It s not even your tooth to give !", "Katsuki ($_katsuki) opens his ($_katsuki) mouth and snaps it shut . Shut the fuck up , he ($_katsuki) says instead , reaching in to grab a fistful of Eijirou ($_eijirou) s shirt . Or I ll leave your behind one day , see how that feels . \n", "Fuck him ($_katsuki) , Eijirou ($_eijirou) points way back to the town square , where the merchant with the cute face and smile is still sitting innocently .

Yeah , sure , he ($_katsuki) gestures weakly at the square . Just ask a boy if he ($_katsuki) s cursed .
