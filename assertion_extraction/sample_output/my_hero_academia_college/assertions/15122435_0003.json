He can only hope that he wo n't catch a cold due to this . \n", "A-alright , Izuku ($_izuku) relents , moving to keep up with him ($_katsuki) . Where are we going ? \n", " You ($_katsuki) said yours ($_katsuki) , but my village is n't owned by anyone , Izuku ($_izuku) explains , plucking at the grass as a means to distract himself ($_izuku) from the pain .

We must live in different places .", "Katsuki ($_katsuki) squints . Yeah? Then where do you ($_katsuki) live ? \n", "Well , we re in a bit of a predicament now , are n't we ?

Yeah , she ($_katsuki) d give him ($_katsuki) another shot . \n", "The rain pours harder , leaving Katsuki ($_katsuki) little room to ponder over it thoroughly .

What happened?

I do n't know who you ($_katsuki) are , either . Are you ($_katsuki) sure we live in the same village ? \n", "I do n't wan na there s not quite right , says Izuku ($_izuku) between breathless groans , sitting upright and rubbing his ($_izuku) injury .

Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) demands , glaring down at her ($_mother) son . She ($_mother) plants her ($_mother) hands on her ($_mother) hips , lips pursed . You ($_katsuki) are not to leave the village again unless it s an emergency , and , as I can likely guess She ($_mother) carefully examines Katsuki ($_katsuki) s form , ruffled hair and dirtied cape and all . What was it you ($_katsuki) were doing out there that put you ($_katsuki) in this disheveled state , Katsuki ($_katsuki) ?", "For the people in this village , it s strictly forbidden , Mitsuki ($_mitsuki) answers after a moment , confirming what Katsuki ($_katsuki) had already been thinking .

As the word leaves his ($_katsuki) lips Katsuki ($_katsuki) feels the lightest press against his ($_katsuki) nose , causing him ($_katsuki) to scrunch it instinctively . Then another drop hits his ($_katsuki) cheek and he ($_katsuki) reaches out to touch the spot , noting the water on his ($_katsuki) fingers , appearing red against the blood he ($_katsuki) has yet to wash off . Oh , he ($_katsuki) says , I guess it is raining . \n", "Izuku ($_izuku) crosses his ($_izuku) arms over his ($_izuku) chest . I hope the others are doing alright How long do you ($_izuku) think it s gon na be until we find them ? he ($_katsuki) asks Katsuki ($_katsuki) .

Anyway , what are your ($_katsuki) friends like ? \n", "Katsuki ($_katsuki) hesitates . Is he ($_katsuki) making fun of me ? But all he ($_katsuki) manages is Oh . \n", "It s mainly quiet as they continue their trek , the main source of noise being the normal , forest-y sounds that Katsuki ($_katsuki) finds solace in however , not the same can be said for Izuku , who glances around nervously and jumps at every little thing , having a hard time swallowing his fear . He mutters a prayer under his breath and Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares at him . \n", "That 's nice , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says distractedly , his ($_katsuki) attention deviated more focused on making sure they do n't bump into anything that is n't friendly . Well , if they did find a animal it would be good for his ($_katsuki) hunt He ($_katsuki) d have to make sure Izuku ($_izuku) stayed out of his ($_katsuki) way \n", "... Then you got lost 'cause you re useless , right ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) guesses , disinterested . Lower class problems hold no significance to him ($_iida) . \n", "A warning ?

Shit , did they find the trap Deku fell in ? I made sure to repair it after I dropped him off at his village , but it s possible they may have found a disturbance . Damn it ! \n", "Mother and Father will be wondering where I am soon , he ($_katsuki) thinks , and apts to find something prior to it getting completely dark . He ($_katsuki) walks slowly , keeping the sound he ($_katsuki) s making to a minimum , and ducks behind a bush to see if anything will come into view . He ($_katsuki) places his ($_katsuki) sword at his ($_katsuki) side in favor of grabbing the bow slung over his ($_katsuki) shoulder instead , inserting an arrow and waiting patiently . \n", "Finding an animal , a task that should ve been simple in theory , is proving to be harder the longer he ($_katsuki) s out here . Almost nothing has appeared for him ($_katsuki) to slay , the two creatures he ($_katsuki) has spotted a deer and a bear being scared away due to his ($_katsuki) inability to shoot an arrow property though , in his ($_katsuki) defense , the second arrow had nearly nicked that bear . \n", "It s getting late .

You and the others ? \n", "Katsuki ($_katsuki) bends down on his ($_katsuki) knees and gets a closer look at the penetrating arrow , not that examining it would be useful in this situation .

Albeit , a horrible one . \n", "Hey , you , he ($_katsuki) says , we re gon na have to rip the arrow out . \n", " The boy is instantly on edge , fighting against Katsuki ($_katsuki) s touch and slapping at his ($_katsuki) hands whenever they come near to the wound . No , you ca n't do that ! It s gon na hurt too much and I m gon na bleed ! Up close Katsuki ($_katsuki) can see that he ($_katsuki) s crying , tears staining his ($_katsuki) cheeks in twin streams . I never wanted this to happen ! I 'm too young to die !", " Quit being overdramatic , Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps , placing his ($_katsuki) weapons on the ground . You re not gon na die . I 'm not gon na let you die , you hear ? We just have to figure out a way for you to His ($_katsuki) gaze flickers to his ($_katsuki) bow . Wooden. He ($_katsuki) ponders . Hmm.", " Then it hits him ($_katsuki) . Hold on a second , he ($_katsuki) tells the boy , and runs towards the nearest tree . Having to get on his ($_katsuki) tiptoes to reach the lowest branch , he ($_katsuki) snaps it off and quickly returns . Holding it over the boy s face , he ($_katsuki) says , I want you to bite on this . It s gon na hurt when I pull the arrow out .", "W-what ? No , there has to be another way , there s no way I 'm doing that , I can t But the protest is cut off as Katsuki ($_katsuki) unceremoniously shoves the stick in his ($_katsuki) mouth and places both his ($_katsuki) hands on the arrow , one on the base where it digs into the boy s shoulder and the other at the end . Taking the hint , the boy bites down on the stick and squeezes his eyes shut , obviously prepared for the worst . \n", "Okay , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says , I ll count . Three he tightens his grip , readying himself two the boy s expression tightens , likely out of fear one . And , in a single , swift motion he tugs the arrow out , the scream that the boy manages being stifled by the stick . \n", "Letting the bloodied arrow drop to the ground , Katsuki ($_katsuki) immediately begins to apply pressure to the wound and keeps pressing down until the bleeding calms a little . The boy mutters something incomprehensible , prompting Katsuki ($_katsuki) to take the stick out his ($_katsuki) mouth . I-it s blood , I m bleeding I do n't want to \n", "Shut up , I know . I can clearly see the blood , Katsuki ($_katsuki) replies , nodding towards his ($_katsuki) stained hands . That 's why I 'm gon na stop it from bleeding , then you 're gon na be fine . Holding an arm to his ($_katsuki) chest so the sleeve can hang loose , Katsuki ($_katsuki) uses his ($_katsuki) sword to cut it off and wrap up the boy s wound , looping the fabric around his ($_katsuki) armpit and over the shoulder . \n", "Then , wiping the sweat from his ($_katsuki) forehead and not caring that it s leaving behind blood stains , Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks , How are you feeling ? \n", "\"Yes. Katsuki ($_katsuki) lies . \n", "Would you look at that , Mina ($_mina) says , stopping , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) follows suit . We re here . Sure enough , there is Katsuki ($_katsuki) s hut , clear as day , large and regal as it 's always been . \n", "Kirishima ($_kirishima) was with me , Katsuki ($_katsuki) thinks , and saw him ($_deku) , but he ($_deku) chose to lie for my sake . Now that I look back He ($_deku) had n't even asked about who Deku ($_deku) was , just simply accepted that there was a person on our territory and that I wanted to return him ($_deku) home rather than take him ($_deku) in . Logically , though , there came the question There 's another village in the forest ? which Katsuki ($_katsuki) had to answer yes , yes there is , and it 's better to keep quiet about it but still , it was odd how well Kirishima ($_kirishima) had taken this information . \n", "Yes , Mother ($_mother) Mother_,_Katsuki ($_mother) says , his head bowed to hide the irritated expression on his face as he half-heartedly listens to her ($_mother) lecture that , on a semi-related note , is not unlike the countless lectures she ($_mother) 's given him prior to tonight .

Would that help ease your ($_katsuki) worries ? \n", "Katsuki ($_katsuki) ignores her ($_mina) , more so focused on getting to where he ($_katsuki) needs to be .

I 'm amazing . Allowing small explosions to go off in his ($_katsuki) palm , it provides some light as they walk together .

That makes things easy , but he should be at his village already . He s sure his mother is worried sick . Besides , this could be a trick . This boy could be luring me into a trap .", "Not long before you ($_katsuki) shot me with your ($_katsuki) arrow , Izuku ($_izuku) answers simply , meaning they should be within the vicinity somewhere . \n", "It was really nice what you ($_katsuki) did for me , taking the arrow out and stuff , Izuku ($_izuku) says , his ($_izuku) cheeks flushed as he ($_izuku) matches Katsuki ($_katsuki) s stride .
