($_tokoyami)	Thank you , my dear friend . He squeezed Tokoyami_'s ($_tokoyami) free shoulder . The prince 's stiff shoulders relaxed and his eyes softened for an instant before his royal mask slid back in place . Now , let 's face the king . 
 Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) bowed slightly , red eyes flashing . It might be unwise to approach his ($_tokoyami) majesty at this time . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) head , eyes dry but the remains of his ($_shouto) breakdown still visible in the russet of his ($_shouto) cheeks and the pallor that dampened his ($_shouto) skin . Tell me ($_tokoyami) . 
 Altercations with his ($_tokoyami) father never left the prince in the best of conditions , but this seemed worse than ever . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) squeeze his ($_tokoyami) prince and childhood friend to his ($_tokoyami) chest . He ($_tokoyami) ran soothing circles across Shouto ($_shouto) s back and waited until the tears abated . With a soft voice like the flapping of wings , he ($_tokoyami) whispered , I ($_tokoyami) have an idea where you can do as your father commands and deny him ($_tokoyami) the joy of controlling you . 
 The mage opened his arms and Shouto ($_shouto) fell into them with silent sobs . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) stroked the soft white and red hair as he ($_tokoyami) sent Dark Shadow worried glances . 
 

($_'s)	I 've come to formally request that the dragon slayer be rewarded with my own personal treasure , Shouto_'s ($_'s) clear tenor rang pure against the sparsely decorated walls . 
 I should be able to find my own person in my own time . Why use our people as a means to ensuring the power in the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line ? Our people are not there as fodder for your trial and I refuse to be apart of it ! Shouto_'s ($_'s) voice rose against his ($_'s) will , anger fanning the flame inside him ($_'s) . 
  A crack rattled the few armaments that decorated the walls and Shouto thought a dragon attack was upon the castle . He ($_'s) looked around , but the room was whole and there was no sign of dragon fire . When he ($_'s) d spotted the source of the thunderous boom , he ($_'s) schooled his ($_'s) facial expression to one of cold neutrality , but fire burned behind his ($_'s) eyes . Two large dents , like craters under each hand , scared the wood of the war room table . The boom was the wood snapping under the king 's fists .  Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) swooped down , spreading its ($_shadow) enormous wings as it ($_shadow) landed on Shouto_'s ($_'s) shoulder . It ($_shadow) created a silhouette of an avenging angel and a few heroes averted their eyes despite themselves . Some stray black and glossy feathers fluttered to the ground before the bird screeched . Shouto ($_shouto) could see some of the heroes cover their ears before his ($_shouto) vision was engulfed by black wings . In a flurry of feathers and tendrils of shadow , Shouto ($_shouto) was swept from the room . The magic left an earthy musk behind . 

($_shouto)	Shouto ($_shouto) looked for the shadow-like bird that perched on the rafters . Give me strength , he asked with his eyes . His silent plea seemed to be understood by Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) and Shouto ($_shouto) took comfort in its presence . Dual colored eyes locked on the king and he squared his shoulders . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) closed the shutters with a rattle , muffling the racket from the street below . Another dragon attack . He ($_shouto) d begged the royal priest to have the gods smite the dragon themselves , but it seems the gods did not listen to selfish requests . Shouto ($_shouto) s heart thumped against his ($_shouto) chest , its ($_shouto) true that his ($_shouto) uncharacteristic visits to the priest were not wholly on behalf of his ($_shouto) suffering populous . 
 Tugging on the embroidered bell pull twice , he ($_shouto) called his ($_shouto) valet . It was only a moment before a curt rapping sounded at the door . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) hesitated for a moment at his ($_shouto) servant and friend s warning , but ultimately shook his ($_shouto) head . I know , and I appreciate you trying to protect me . But this is my future at stake , I must try . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) shivered under the sheer force of his ($_shouto) father 's words . He ($_shouto) was careful not to reach for the scar on his ($_shouto) face . The one put there as a reminder that he ($_shouto) , too , would one day become a tyrant . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) head , eyes dry but the remains of his ($_shouto) breakdown still visible in the russet of his ($_shouto) cheeks and the pallor that dampened his ($_shouto) skin . Tell me ($_tokoyami) . 
 Altercations with his ($_tokoyami) father never left the prince in the best of conditions , but this seemed worse than ever . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) squeeze his ($_tokoyami) prince and childhood friend to his ($_tokoyami) chest . He ($_tokoyami) ran soothing circles across Shouto ($_shouto) s back and waited until the tears abated . With a soft voice like the flapping of wings , he ($_tokoyami) whispered , I ($_tokoyami) have an idea where you can do as your father commands and deny him ($_tokoyami) the joy of controlling you . 
 The mage opened his arms and Shouto ($_shouto) fell into them with silent sobs . Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) stroked the soft white and red hair as he ($_tokoyami) sent Dark Shadow worried glances . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) stood wide-eyed in front of Tokoyami , cold hatred melting into tears down his ($_shouto) cheek . 
  Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) swooped down , spreading its ($_shadow) enormous wings as it ($_shadow) landed on Shouto_'s ($_'s) shoulder . It ($_shadow) created a silhouette of an avenging angel and a few heroes averted their eyes despite themselves . Some stray black and glossy feathers fluttered to the ground before the bird screeched . Shouto ($_shouto) could see some of the heroes cover their ears before his ($_shouto) vision was engulfed by black wings . In a flurry of feathers and tendrils of shadow , Shouto ($_shouto) was swept from the room . The magic left an earthy musk behind . As you wish , father , he ($_shouto) spat . Ice spread across his ($_shouto) features , cold and unfeeling . 
 

($_endeavor)	All speaking ceased and Endeavor ($_endeavor) raised a red eyebrow at his son 's entrance . 
 I will have you tried for treason to the crown if you say another word ! Endeavor_'s ($_endeavor) voice boomed in the small space , You will marry who I please and the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line will become more powerful . My word is law . 
 

($_shadow)	Shouto ($_shouto) looked for the shadow-like bird that perched on the rafters . Give me strength , he asked with his eyes . His silent plea seemed to be understood by Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) and Shouto ($_shouto) took comfort in its presence . Dual colored eyes locked on the king and he squared his shoulders . 
 A red eye flicked to the black bird who seemed to shrug in answer . Fine , but let me send Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) with you . 
  Dark_Shadow ($_shadow) swooped down , spreading its ($_shadow) enormous wings as it ($_shadow) landed on Shouto_'s ($_'s) shoulder . It ($_shadow) created a silhouette of an avenging angel and a few heroes averted their eyes despite themselves .

In a flurry of feathers and tendrils of shadow , Shouto ($_shouto) was swept from the room . The magic left an earthy musk behind . 

($_todoroki)	Todoroki ($_todoroki) was tall for his nineteen years , yet he felt dwarfed by not only the size of the room 's occupants but also their power . He could feel it like a tangible thing , rolling off them in waves . 
 I should be able to find my own person in my own time . Why use our people as a means to ensuring the power in the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line ? Our people are not there as fodder for your trial and I refuse to be apart of it ! Shouto_'s ($_'s) voice rose against his ($_'s) will , anger fanning the flame inside him ($_'s) . 
 I will have you tried for treason to the crown if you say another word ! Endeavor_'s ($_endeavor) voice boomed in the small space , You will marry who I please and the Todoroki ($_todoroki) line will become more powerful . My word is law .
