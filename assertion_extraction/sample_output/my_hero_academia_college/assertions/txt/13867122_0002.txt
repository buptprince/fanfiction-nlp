($_shoto)	I m Shoto ($_shoto) . I ($_i) say , careful not to reveal my ($_i) surname . He ($_deku) doesn t seem to mind as he ($_deku) shakes my ($_i) hand as well . 
 Shoto ($_shoto) . 
 Shoto ($_shoto) you need to take your siblings 
  Wait! Don t come - ! Deku ($_deku) shouts out and I ($_deku) look up to him ($_deku) . Then Damian ($_damian) lets out a loud whine when the ice under us breaks . Deku ($_deku) looks like he ($_deku) turns the horse around to get to us but it s too late . Shoto ($_shoto) ! Thanks , it was nice talking with you Shoto ($_shoto) . Deku ($_deku) says and pays Gabriel ($_gabriel) before leaving . 
 SHOTO ($_shoto) ! 
 Shoto ($_shoto) . 
 

($_gabriel)	It looks beautiful . I finally say after realizing how uncomfortable_Deku ($_deku) seemed to become . I can t scare him away , not now . Deku ($_deku) smiles to me awkwardly , he then stands up when Gabriel ($_gabriel) returns . 
 Thanks , it was nice talking with you Shoto ($_shoto) . Deku ($_deku) says and pays Gabriel ($_gabriel) before leaving . 
 So we got bread or meat , which one would you want ? Gabriel ($_gabriel) asks me as I suddenly stood up . 
 Sorry , I ll come back later . Something came up ! I say and quickly leave the bar . Gabriel ($_gabriel) shouts something after me but I have no time to stay and listen . 
 

($_the)	I ($_i) noticed was that the paintings were actually done by my ($_i) ancestor . I ($_i) saw his signature in every artwork . Sadly I ($_i) could not tell much from them except that they always had the same woman in them . A woman sitting by the rocks watching skies , standing in the water with her_dragon ($_the) . There were also some close portraits about her smiling , my ($_i) ancestor really seemed fond of her . 
 Her eyes were red like the_dragon_she_rode ($_the) . She seemed powerful too , maybe someone my ($_i) ancestor was in love with ? 
 

($_damian)	Do you ($_i) think I ($_i) m crazy ? I ($_i) asked , Damian ($_damian) turned to look at me ($_i) with his ($_damian) usual curious eyes . Riding all the way to the north , I m lucky it s not winter . 
 Damian ($_damian) shook his ($_damian) head before going down to lay next to me ($_i) . I ($_i) smiled at him ($_damian) as I ($_i) pet his ($_damian) head . 
 Damian ($_damian) looks horrified when we fall to the running water . I try to get to him ($_deku) to save him ($_deku) , but Damian ($_damian) accidentally kicks me in the head while trying to swim to safety . 
 I urge Damian ($_damian) to run again so that we d catch up with him ($_deku) . Deku ($_deku) notices me and his ($_deku) expression turns shocked . 
  Wait! Don t come - ! Deku ($_deku) shouts out and I ($_deku) look up to him ($_deku) . Then Damian ($_damian) lets out a loud whine when the ice under us breaks . Deku ($_deku) looks like he ($_deku) turns the horse around to get to us but it s too late . Shoto ($_shoto) ! I hope Damian ($_damian) got to the shore . 
 I ($_i) press against Damian ($_damian) s sides gently to signal him ($_damian) to move forward . The nearest town wasn t too far away but it would take a while to get there . 
 I ($_i) kick rest of the campfire so it s out completely . This way there s no risk of a forest fire . I ($_i) jump to Damian ($_damian) s back , riding him ($_damian) has gotten much smoother after I ($_i) got the saddle . 
 I haven t even needed to tie him ($_damian) up to make sure he ($_damian) won t abandon me ($_i) , Damian ($_damian) seems to be very fond of me ($_i) as well . 
 I ($_i) exhale as my ($_i) breathing calms down , I ($_i) notice that the sun isn t yet up but it s definitely early morning . The fire had gone out leaving only a small , smoking pile . Damian ($_damian) seems to have woken up from my ($_i) panicking , I ($_i) calmly apologize and he ($_damian) puts his ($_damian) head back down . 
 Seems like we re going to have to make another stop Damian . I ($_i) say as I ($_i) stand up . Damian ($_damian) lifts his ($_damian) head before stumbling up and walking to me ($_i) as I ($_i) pack things . 
 Damian ($_damian) is a strong horse and because of that he ($_damian) s also very fast . It didn t take me long to see Deku ($_deku) again , he ($_damian) was riding in to the forest . I can t lose him ($_damian) so I urge Damian ($_damian) to ride faster . Deku ($_deku) turns to look back but I m riding off road , mixed within the trees . 
 Damian ($_damian) was the quiet little brother who enjoyed reading old languages with me ($_i) , the horse counterpart seemed to enjoy hearing me ($_i) read as well . 
  Shut it . I ($_i) murmured face heating up and put the scroll down to throw more wood to the fire . Damian ($_damian) just smelled my ($_i) clothes and I ($_i) knew what he ($_damian) wanted . I ($_i) pulled out a small pouch with treats in it and gave some to him ($_damian) . He ($_damian) gently ate from my ($_i) hands , careful not to bite . Damian ($_damian) nickers , making me ($_i) feel self conscious . 
 Damian ($_damian) poked me ($_i) with his ($_damian) muzzle , I ($_i) smiled at him ($_damian) . 
 Sorry Damian ($_damian) . I ($_i) say as he neighs to me ($_i) , annoyed for being tied to the nearby post . They don t like horses being freely here . I ($_i) ll just buy something and come back . 
 I ($_i) could swear that Damian ($_damian) was frowning , not that I ($_i) could confirm how horses frowned . 
 I ($_i) hadn t taken into account how early on the move I ($_i) was . The sun hadn t even risen when we arrived . I sigh as I ($_i) drop down and proceed to walk Damian ($_damian) to where horses are supposed to be left when entering the bar that was literally the only place open . 
 I lifted my eyes to see where Deku ($_deku) went but don t see him ($_damian) anywhere . I hope I didn t lose him ($_damian) already . 
 Right before it closes , Damian ($_damian) reaches the other side and water hits him ($_damian) in the tail . Damian ($_damian) seems slightly distressed so I hush him ($_damian) to calm him ($_damian) down . 
 Waterfall starts to return to normal right before I reach it so I signal Damian ($_damian) to jump in . 
 I feel shocked as Deku ($_deku) begins to ride past it . I realize I can t waste time so I gently kick Damian ($_damian) to make him ($_damian) run . 
 I see Deku ($_deku) stop riding and I slow down as well . He ($_damian) stopped on a cliff , I try to see better what he ($_damian) s doing but don t dare to bring Damian ($_damian) too close . 
 Damian ($_damian) is able to keep up with Deku ($_deku) easily , he ($_damian) s used to running in uneven ground . 
 We walk slowly with Damian ($_damian) , then I notice Deku ($_deku) climbing up the mountain road with his ($_deku) horse . 
 

($_i)	I ($_i) was fascinated with the female dragon rider who my ($_i) ancestor kept repeating in his stories . It was rather disappointing I ($_i) couldn t understand what her name was or how it was pronounced . I ($_i) noticed a tattoo on her shoulder and I ($_i) recognised it as the same symbol as the one that had been in the secret room s passage . My ($_i) father used to say this mark symbolises strength and that it was important for me ($_i) to remember . Never did he tell me ($_i) the reason for it . 
 You ($_i) re powerful then ? Or your ($_i) clan is ? I ($_i) wondered out loud as I ($_i) stared at her images . It was frustrating to say the least . At the end of the day all I ($_i) had was this symbol , knowledge that they reside in the north and that the hide behind the mountains . 
 Why are the hiding ? If they re so powerful and have dragons , hiding seemed really foolish for me ($_i) . Why weren t they joining the world ? 
 I ($_i) felt my ($_i) eyelids get heavier and my ($_i) vision got blurry . I ($_i) tried to fight the sleep like I ($_i) do every night but in the end , like every other night , I ($_i) fell asleep . 
 I m fine Damian , no need to worry . It was strange , talking to a horse . Yet at the same time this horse was the only one I ($_i) could trust . There was no one else anymore . 
 Do you ($_i) think I ($_i) m crazy ? I ($_i) asked , Damian ($_damian) turned to look at me ($_i) with his ($_damian) usual curious eyes . Riding all the way to the north , I m lucky it s not winter . 
 Damian ($_damian) shook his ($_damian) head before going down to lay next to me ($_i) . I ($_i) smiled at him ($_damian) as I ($_i) pet his ($_damian) head . 
 I ($_i) turned to look at the scrolls again , it was much more interesting to me ($_i) than sleeping . 
 The scrolls were old but despite their age , in a really good shape . From what I ($_i) had gathered so far , I ($_i) could tell that the dragon riders were a strong and prideful folk . With their help , my ($_i) ancestor conquered and built his kingdom . I ($_i) still wasn t sure what the fire in the painting had meant but I ($_i) decided it most likely was just a metaphor for sharing power or something . 
 I ($_i) had a plan , no matter how crazy it sounded . Honestly , I ($_i) had nothing to lose at this point . I ($_i) was planning to find these dragon riders , ask them to help my ($_i) family once again . Ask them to stop the darkness that was looming over our world . 
 Ah this , it s a gift . He says nervously . It s just a small thing , nothing too impressive but I ($_i) like it . 
 That necklace , where did you ($_i) get it ? I ($_i) ask , the_boy ($_deku) seems to flinch . 
 I ($_i) thought as much , you have southern clothing . I ($_i) m called Deku ($_deku) , it s a nickname that I m quite fond of . Deku ($_deku) says to me ($_i) . I ($_i) have no idea why would he ($_deku) like to be called by his ($_deku) nickname by a total stranger but I ($_i) lift my ($_i) hand to shake his ($_deku) . 
 Yes , I m not from around here . I ($_i) say and turn to him ($_deku) again . He ($_deku) smiles at me ($_i) and nods . 
 Then I ($_i) see it , a small necklace around his ($_deku) neck . It usually wouldn t stick in my ($_i) mind but I ($_i) recognised the symbol on it . Strength , just like on that girl s shoulder and under my ($_i) home . 
 I m Shoto ($_shoto) . I ($_i) say , careful not to reveal my ($_i) surname . He ($_deku) doesn t seem to mind as he ($_deku) shakes my ($_i) hand as well . 
 The_boy ($_deku) chuckles and then turns to smile at me ($_i) . 
 Hey Gabriel ! The usual please. The boy shouts and I ($_i) hear the man from earlier to shout back to him ($_deku) . 
 I ($_i) realize he ($_deku) s noticed I ($_i) ve been staring so I ($_i) turn to look away . 
 Every time I ($_i) had time to rest , I ($_i) d use it to read about the legend of the dragon riders . 
 From what I ($_i) could translate , it seemed like the dragon riders hid from humankind in the strange land hidden behind the northern mountains . 
 I ($_i) press against Damian ($_damian) s sides gently to signal him ($_damian) to move forward . The nearest town wasn t too far away but it would take a while to get there . 
 I ($_i) kick rest of the campfire so it s out completely . This way there s no risk of a forest fire . I ($_i) jump to Damian ($_damian) s back , riding him ($_damian) has gotten much smoother after I ($_i) got the saddle . 
 I haven t even needed to tie him ($_damian) up to make sure he ($_damian) won t abandon me ($_i) , Damian ($_damian) seems to be very fond of me ($_i) as well . 
 I ($_i) exhale as my ($_i) breathing calms down , I ($_i) notice that the sun isn t yet up but it s definitely early morning . The fire had gone out leaving only a small , smoking pile . Damian ($_damian) seems to have woken up from my ($_i) panicking , I ($_i) calmly apologize and he ($_damian) puts his ($_damian) head back down . 
 I ($_i) gasp loudly as I ($_i) sit up to escape my ($_i) nightmare . I ($_i) take deep breaths to calm myself ($_i) before rubbing my ($_i) face . I m fine , it s fine . I m alive 
 Seems like we re going to have to make another stop Damian . I ($_i) say as I ($_i) stand up . Damian ($_damian) lifts his ($_damian) head before stumbling up and walking to me ($_i) as I ($_i) pack things . 
 My ($_i) stomach crumbles and I ($_i) pull my ($_i) bag that s nearby , it s running empty . There s only one bread left and I ($_i) sigh in frustration . I ($_i) will need to visit another town again , luckily I ($_i) still have money left from my ($_i) last job . 
 I ($_i) bite my ($_i) lip and hug myself ($_i) , I ($_i) need to get a grip . Being this way isn t helpful at all , I ($_i) need to have faith that these scrolls mean something . 
 I ($_i) look down , the voices never leave me ($_i) . I ($_i) can t sleep without being followed by them , not until I ($_i) get my ($_i) revenge . 
 It was strange , living on the road for months but I ($_i) had no choice if I ($_i) wanted to get my ($_i) revenge on Tomura Shigaraki . So I ($_i) did what I ($_i) had to , eat when I ($_i) could and did small jobs to earn food or money for my ($_i) travels in different towns . 
 There was a part which was missing so I ($_i) wasn t sure why but for some reason dragon riders all disappeared . My ($_i) ancestor gave them something in return for their service and then they were never seen again . 
 The horse I ($_i) stole came to snuffle my ($_i) hair , we had become pretty close with each other . I ($_i) named him Damian , ironically the same name that one of my ($_i) brother s had . Damian Todoroki , funny right ? But my ($_i) mother was a foreigner , that s where the name came from . 
 I ($_i) noticed was that the paintings were actually done by my ($_i) ancestor . I ($_i) saw his signature in every artwork . Sadly I ($_i) could not tell much from them except that they always had the same woman in them . A woman sitting by the rocks watching skies , standing in the water with her_dragon ($_the) . There were also some close portraits about her smiling , my ($_i) ancestor really seemed fond of her . 
 Damian ($_damian) was the quiet little brother who enjoyed reading old languages with me ($_i) , the horse counterpart seemed to enjoy hearing me ($_i) read as well . 
 I ($_i) huffed , she did look beautiful in a strange , foreign way . 
 Her eyes were red like the_dragon_she_rode ($_the) . She seemed powerful too , maybe someone my ($_i) ancestor was in love with ? 
  Shut it . I ($_i) murmured face heating up and put the scroll down to throw more wood to the fire . Damian ($_damian) just smelled my ($_i) clothes and I ($_i) knew what he ($_damian) wanted . I ($_i) pulled out a small pouch with treats in it and gave some to him ($_damian) . He ($_damian) gently ate from my ($_i) hands , careful not to bite . Damian ($_damian) nickers , making me ($_i) feel self conscious . 
 Damian ($_damian) poked me ($_i) with his ($_damian) muzzle , I ($_i) smiled at him ($_damian) . 
 The fire danced on the campfire , creating shadows with it s light . I ($_i) stared at it in silence before yawning . I ($_i) felt tired , not much surprise there considering I ($_i) slept as little as I ($_i) could . Because whenever I ($_i) closed my ($_i) eyes , I ($_i) saw the rotting bodies in the ruins of my ($_i) home . 
 I ($_i) sigh and look around , everyone seems to be mostly minding their own business . 
 A_boy ($_deku) sits next to me ($_i) , around the same age as I ($_i) am . I ($_i) notice his ($_deku) unusual hair color , it s dark green . 
 This is the only place open . I ($_i) say , he huffs but nods . I ($_i) sit to wait as he goes get some water and food for me ($_i) . 
 When I ($_i) entered the bar it was surprisingly crowded . I ($_i) walk to the counter and this only slightly older man turns to me ($_i) . The bar probably belongs to the father or then he s very young bar owner . 
 Hello , I ($_i) d like to buy some food and water from my ($_i) travels . I ($_i) say politely , he looks at me ($_i) and arches a brow . 
 Sorry Damian ($_damian) . I ($_i) say as he neighs to me ($_i) , annoyed for being tied to the nearby post . They don t like horses being freely here . I ($_i) ll just buy something and come back . 
 I ($_i) could swear that Damian ($_damian) was frowning , not that I ($_i) could confirm how horses frowned . 
 I ($_i) take a bite from the bread on my ($_i) hand as we ride towards our destination . 
 I ($_i) hadn t taken into account how early on the move I ($_i) was . The sun hadn t even risen when we arrived . I sigh as I ($_i) drop down and proceed to walk Damian ($_damian) to where horses are supposed to be left when entering the bar that was literally the only place open . 
 After discovering that room I ($_i) took as many scrolls as I ($_i) could carry , any food I ($_i) could carry , fed my ($_i) horse and then rode to north . 
 I ($_i) mean , obviously the man , Tomura , was trying to find this information too . Why else come to my ($_i) home and destroy everything , this information was important . It had to be ! I ($_i) refused to believe that my ($_i) family died for nothing . 
 

($_deku)	That necklace , where did you ($_i) get it ? I ($_i) ask , the_boy ($_deku) seems to flinch . 
 I ($_i) thought as much , you have southern clothing . I ($_i) m called Deku ($_deku) , it s a nickname that I m quite fond of . Deku ($_deku) says to me ($_i) . I ($_i) have no idea why would he ($_deku) like to be called by his ($_deku) nickname by a total stranger but I ($_i) lift my ($_i) hand to shake his ($_deku) . 
 Yes , I m not from around here . I ($_i) say and turn to him ($_deku) again . He ($_deku) smiles at me ($_i) and nods . 
 Then I ($_i) see it , a small necklace around his ($_deku) neck . It usually wouldn t stick in my ($_i) mind but I ($_i) recognised the symbol on it . Strength , just like on that girl s shoulder and under my ($_i) home . 
 I m Shoto ($_shoto) . I ($_i) say , careful not to reveal my ($_i) surname . He ($_deku) doesn t seem to mind as he ($_deku) shakes my ($_i) hand as well . 
 The_boy ($_deku) chuckles and then turns to smile at me ($_i) . 
 Hey Gabriel ! The usual please. The boy shouts and I ($_i) hear the man from earlier to shout back to him ($_deku) . 
 I ($_i) realize he ($_deku) s noticed I ($_i) ve been staring so I ($_i) turn to look away . 
 You don t look like a local . He ($_deku) says , breaking the silence between us . 
 Damian ($_damian) looks horrified when we fall to the running water . I try to get to him ($_deku) to save him ($_deku) , but Damian ($_damian) accidentally kicks me in the head while trying to swim to safety . 
 I urge Damian ($_damian) to run again so that we d catch up with him ($_deku) . Deku ($_deku) notices me and his ($_deku) expression turns shocked . 
  Wait! Don t come - ! Deku ($_deku) shouts out and I ($_deku) look up to him ($_deku) . Then Damian ($_damian) lets out a loud whine when the ice under us breaks . Deku ($_deku) looks like he ($_deku) turns the horse around to get to us but it s too late . Shoto ($_shoto) ! It looks beautiful . I finally say after realizing how uncomfortable_Deku ($_deku) seemed to become . I can t scare him away , not now . Deku ($_deku) smiles to me awkwardly , he then stands up when Gabriel ($_gabriel) returns . 
 Here you go Deku ($_deku) . He says and gives Deku ($_deku) this big bag . 
 Thanks , it was nice talking with you Shoto ($_shoto) . Deku ($_deku) says and pays Gabriel ($_gabriel) before leaving . 
 I see Deku ($_deku) getting up on a horse and he ($_deku) notices me and I can swear I saw him ($_deku) curse under his ($_deku) breath . 
 Deku ($_deku) quickly signals his ($_deku) horse to start running . He ($_deku) definitely wants to hide something and it must have something to do with that necklace , he ($_deku) became scared the moment I mentioned it . 
 I ran to Damian and quickly freed him ($_deku) before getting up on his ($_deku) back . 
 Damian ($_damian) is a strong horse and because of that he ($_damian) s also very fast . It didn t take me long to see Deku ($_deku) again , he ($_damian) was riding in to the forest . I can t lose him ($_damian) so I urge Damian ($_damian) to ride faster . Deku ($_deku) turns to look back but I m riding off road , mixed within the trees . 
 We don t know , he followed Deku ($_deku) here . A tall woman next to him answers . 
 A_boy ($_deku) sits next to me ($_i) , around the same age as I ($_i) am . I ($_i) notice his ($_deku) unusual hair color , it s dark green . 
 I lifted my eyes to see where Deku ($_deku) went but don t see him ($_damian) anywhere . I hope I didn t lose him ($_damian) already . 
 I feel shocked as Deku ($_deku) begins to ride past it . I realize I can t waste time so I gently kick Damian ($_damian) to make him ($_damian) run . 
 Deku ($_deku) takes his ($_deku) necklace and lifts it up in the air . Suddenly the water splits apart , showing a path inside the waterfall that goes right through the mountain . 
 There is a huge waterfall in front of the cliff , I can t understand why Deku ($_deku) would stop there . 
 I see Deku ($_deku) stop riding and I slow down as well . He ($_damian) stopped on a cliff , I try to see better what he ($_damian) s doing but don t dare to bring Damian ($_damian) too close . 
 Damian ($_damian) is able to keep up with Deku ($_deku) easily , he ($_damian) s used to running in uneven ground . 
 We walk slowly with Damian ($_damian) , then I notice Deku ($_deku) climbing up the mountain road with his ($_deku) horse .
