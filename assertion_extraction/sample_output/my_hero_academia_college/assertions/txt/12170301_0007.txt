($_momo)	Hey, look over here! The girl cries , and her footsteps are suddenly right below Momo ($_momo) . Someone s set up camp here ! Maybe if we can find whoever s staying here , we can ask for directions ! 
 Momo ($_momo) cranes one eye open ever so slightly . The girl , who has short brown hair and a round face , wanders around the space they set up , looking at their bags and washing line , poking their clothes and looking shocked when she felt what they were made of . The two boys that followed her had blue and green hair , and seemed less than pleased at their friend s nosiness . Momo ($_momo) closes her eyes again when the girl reaches the bottom of her tree , and looks up , seeing the girl in the branches . 
  Hey! She hisses , calling the intention of her two friends . Do you think ... Momo ($_momo) assumes she s pointing at her , or at least gesturing in her direction . Excuse me ? She calls , and Momo ($_momo) opens her eyes slowly , looking down at the girl . In serious court situations , yes , Momo ($_momo) chastises . 
  I ll tell them no , he ($_momo) says , getting to his ($_momo) feet and offering his ($_momo) hand to help her up . She takes it , pulling herself up , and the two of them walk back together . As soon as they make it to the clearing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) gasps , his ($_midoriya) eyes falling on the prince . Looking round at the sound , Iida ($_iida) and Uraraka ($_uraraka) gasp too .  Shoto rolls his ($_iida) eyes at their reactions , until Midoriya ($_midoriya) closes the distance between them , dropping to his ($_iida) knees and taking Shoto s hand , placing a kiss on the back of it . The prince looks horrified , and Momo ($_momo) gently pushes Midoriya ($_midoriya) away . Iida ($_iida) s face is painted in confusion and Uraraka ($_uraraka) only laughs . You might be reading too much into this , Momo ($_momo) warns . Shoto ($_shoto) rarely displays this much emotion , and his panic scares her - if he decides to do something rash , there s no guarantee she can protect him . 
  I think he ($_shoto) ll need a moment to think about this , Momo ($_momo) says after a long silence , giving Shoto ($_shoto) an out to pull himself ($_shoto) away from the conversation . His ($_shoto) eyes are glazed over , deep in thought , and he ($_shoto) gets to his ($_shoto) feet , wandering away from the group . After a few minutes , Momo ($_momo) gets up and walks to him ($_shoto) , hovering by his ($_shoto) side , waiting for him ($_shoto) to speak first . Her own heart has been swayed by the tale of the three travellers they ve bumped into . Their story is convincing , and she realises herself how little both herself and Shoto ($_shoto) really know about the outside world . I was eight , Midoriya ($_midoriya) answers , his ($_midoriya) brows furrowing . Shoto ($_shoto) does the maths in his ($_shoto) head - that makes Midoriya ($_midoriya) older than both him ($_shoto) and Momo ($_momo) , even if he ($_shoto) thought he ($_shoto) looked younger . 
 He ($_fuyumi) s probably not too pleased , Momo ($_momo) says , finally voicing her thoughts . He ($_fuyumi) laughs a little at this , and it puts her at ease - clearly , he ($_fuyumi) s not as worried about the situation as she thought . 
  Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) reappear and find the boys still sitting awkwardly on the grass . Shoto ($_shoto) at least has made himself ($_shoto) helpful - readying the pot that was attached to his ($_shoto) own horse . Momo ($_momo) finds ingredients from her bag and Shoto lights the fire with his ($_shoto) magic , causing Ochako ($_ochako) to squeal with excitement as a fellow magic user . He ($_shoto) can t help but smile at her enthusiasm , and sits back when Momo ($_momo) throws chopped up vegetables and their leftover meat from the last town they stopped in . Tenya ($_tenya) adds water , and they sit back , waiting patiently for their meal to cook .  This feeling of eating together as a big group is completely foreign to Shoto . He ($_shoto) usually ate with just Fuyumi , and occasionally their father joined them for the meal . He ($_shoto) knew Momo ($_momo) would be accustomed to the occasion - the servants always ate in large groups , he ($_shoto) was aware . But he ($_shoto) couldn t complain - the sensation of sharing with others was pleasing to him ($_shoto) . Everyone was laughing and joking with each other , and even though he ($_shoto) d just met these three people , they offered him ($_shoto) more of a family than his ($_shoto) father did . Please feel free to call me Momo ($_momo) . Or Yaomomo , if that makes you feel more comfortable . I tried to get Shoto ($_shoto) to call me that , but it ($_shoto) didn t catch on . He ($_momo) gives her a look at that , as if she s exposed one of his ($_momo) secrets . She smiles , and everyone else nods , complete with a soft mumbling of Momo ($_momo) under their breath . 
 Then I suppose I m okay with you all calling me Ochako , Uraraka ($_uraraka) nods , and Momo ($_momo) gives her an encouraging smile . 
  Well , now introductions are over , I suggest we make dinner . The sun will be setting soon , and we don t want to be cooking in the dark . I ll go look for firewood . Ochako ($_ochako) , perhaps you d care to accompany me ? Momo ($_momo) offers , and Ochako ($_ochako) nods aggressively , clearly pleased by the taller girl s invitation . The two wander off into the woods , leaving the three boys staring at each other . Tenya ($_tenya) and Izuku swap looks , taking it in turn to look at Shoto ($_shoto) and wonder just how lucky they got to bump into him . Uncomfortable under their gaze , Shoto ($_shoto) gets up and busies himself ($_shoto) taking down their laundry from the morning , finally dried in the summer heat . He ($_shoto) s more concerned with them looking at Momo ($_momo) s clothes than his ($_shoto) - her nightdress is hung up on their line , as well as one of her casual dresses , made from some lightweight red material . Her armour is strapped to her horse , who can take the weight with ease . He ($_shoto) folds everything up neatly , and even takes down the line itself , winding the string back up and putting it back into the depths of Momo ($_momo) s bag . 
 Can you take us there ?! The green haired boy asks . He looks so excited , and Momo ($_momo) almost wants to say yes . 
 Yes , but I m not from this part , Momo ($_momo) clarifies , and her tough act that she was trying to put up disappears with her polite accent coming out instead . 
 I m not from round here , Momo ($_momo) says , thankful that this at least was true . 
 Just answer the question , the taller boy sighs , and Momo ($_momo) bites her lip . 
 Where are you from , then ? The other boy asks , his eyes almost hopeful . Momo ($_momo) climbs out of the tree and lands on the ground in front of the group , who instinctively take a step back . 
 The rumours surrounding your ($_iida) disappearance are quite outrageous , Iida ($_iida) agrees . Kidnapping , running away , you ($_iida) two eloping as secret lovers - Shoto ($_shoto) starts a little at this , while Momo ($_momo) raises an unconvinced eyebrow . Really , you ($_iida) ve been the talk of the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) . 
 I don t see how it s any of your ($_iida) business why he ($_shoto) left , Momo ($_momo) fills in , coming to his ($_shoto) defence as she so often does . 
 They sit by a stream and wash their other clothes in the rapidly moving water , filling up bottles a little way upstream so they can drink later . Once their clothes are cleaned , Momo ($_momo) wrings the water out of them before hanging them up on a makeshift washing line she fashions out of a ball of string found in the bottom of her bag . She flops down in the grass after that , grateful for the shade the trees provide against the sun . After a while , Shoto ($_shoto) lies beside her , his ($_shoto) arms crossed over his ($_shoto) chest , glaring into the foliage above them . 
 Momo ($_momo) has no problem with it , he ($_momo) says stubbornly , and she has to laugh - he ($_momo) never has acted like this before , and it makes her smile that he ($_momo) already feels so comfortable with these people . 
 After introductions are done , Momo ($_momo) leaves them with her belongings and runs off in the direction Shoto ($_shoto) wandered off . He ($_momo) is predictable , and she finds him ($_momo) within moments of leaving their camp . He ($_momo) s seated on the ground below a particularly large oak , and she sits beside him ($_momo) , catching her breath . He ($_momo) looks worried for a second , and puts his ($_momo) hand on her forearm . 
 I doubt it , Momo ($_momo) snorts . What are your names ? I don t think it s fair that you ve asked so much about me and I don t know anything about you . 
 Yao ... Yaoyorozu . Momo_Yaoyorozu ($_momo) . The group raise their eyebrows at this . 
 Could you ask your friend if you could take a detour and go back to the capital ? You don t even need to take us inside the walls , or anything , the green haired boy asks , almost pleading with Momo ($_momo) . 
  When the mountain path narrows and trees suddenly surround them , Momo ($_momo) knows that they are on the right track again . They haven t really spoken in the last few hours , but she turns to him ($_momo) with a smile when he ($_momo) releases a relieved sigh . The forest is much more familiar territory for the both of them , considering after the fields surrounding the castle , much of the land near their home was covered in dense woodland . They were more likely to come across adversaries in the forest , and they were both aware of this . It didn t stop them , though - both are armed and well trained in combat . Anyone who came into their path looking for a fight would be the one making the mistake .  This statement piques Shoto ($_shoto) s interest . If three kingdoms are suffering , and their kingdom isn t , perhaps he will have to take matters into his own hands . He was completely against the idea of going back home at the beginning , but the more they explain the situation to him , the more he realises just how sheltered his childhood was . Glancing at Momo ($_momo) out of the corner of his ($_momo) eye , he ($_momo) sees that her expression sums up the emotions he ($_momo) was feeling . He ($_momo) still has questions , however , and he ($_momo) folds his ($_momo) arms over his ($_momo) chest . They sit down on the ground in a semi circle , Shoto ($_shoto) sitting as far away from Midoriya ($_midoriya) as he ($_shoto) can . He ($_shoto) can tell that his ($_shoto) reaction to the boy has made him ($_shoto) uncomfortable , but for someone to kiss his ($_shoto) hand in such a situation outside of the court was strange , and he ($_shoto) hoped deep down that he ($_shoto) would never have to go through that again . Momo ($_momo) elbows him ($_shoto) in the side , and he ($_shoto) begins paying attention as the green haired boy begins his ($_shoto) explanation . 
 

($_fuyumi)	I feel bad about leaving Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) behind , though . And I won t be able to visit my mother , either . She s probably more worried about me than my_father ($_fuyumi) is . 
 He ($_fuyumi) s probably not too pleased , Momo ($_momo) says , finally voicing her thoughts . He ($_fuyumi) laughs a little at this , and it puts her at ease - clearly , he ($_fuyumi) s not as worried about the situation as she thought . 
 I wonder what my_father ($_fuyumi) thinks about me running away . There s a silence after he ($_fuyumi) says that , because she s not sure how King Enji would react at all . He ($_fuyumi) d probably be angry , and disappointed , but she has no idea what he ($_fuyumi) would do in his ($_fuyumi) rage . I mean , Shoto ($_shoto) clarifies , he ($_fuyumi) must know I ve run away , since there would be no signs of an abduction , and he ($_fuyumi) knows I hated living with him ($_fuyumi) . 
 I would suggest that we go up to the lands of the Ice Tribe , but I can t see how we d get there . Your_father ($_fuyumi) has surely sent people there looking for you . 
 

($_shoto)	I would usually ask how you ($_iida) knew who I was , but I assume the posters were a giveaway , Shoto ($_shoto) says . 
 What are you ($_iida) doing ? Shoto ($_shoto) asks , his ($_shoto) voice betraying him ($_shoto) with a tone of disgust . 
 You might be reading too much into this , Momo ($_momo) warns . Shoto ($_shoto) rarely displays this much emotion , and his panic scares her - if he decides to do something rash , there s no guarantee she can protect him . 
  I think he ($_shoto) ll need a moment to think about this , Momo ($_momo) says after a long silence , giving Shoto ($_shoto) an out to pull himself ($_shoto) away from the conversation . His ($_shoto) eyes are glazed over , deep in thought , and he ($_shoto) gets to his ($_shoto) feet , wandering away from the group . After a few minutes , Momo ($_momo) gets up and walks to him ($_shoto) , hovering by his ($_shoto) side , waiting for him ($_shoto) to speak first . Her own heart has been swayed by the tale of the three travellers they ve bumped into . Their story is convincing , and she realises herself how little both herself and Shoto ($_shoto) really know about the outside world . What do you think ? He ($_shoto) asks eventually , looking over her shoulder at the group settled on the grass , whispering between themselves and casting furtive glances in their direction . 
 I was eight , Midoriya ($_midoriya) answers , his ($_midoriya) brows furrowing . Shoto ($_shoto) does the maths in his ($_shoto) head - that makes Midoriya ($_midoriya) older than both him ($_shoto) and Momo ($_momo) , even if he ($_shoto) thought he ($_shoto) looked younger . 
 Is something the matter ? She asks , startling him ($_shoto) . It s the first time she s spoken all day - they ve got used to each other s silence , and it s companionable , not uncomfortable in the slightest . 
  Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) reappear and find the boys still sitting awkwardly on the grass . Shoto ($_shoto) at least has made himself ($_shoto) helpful - readying the pot that was attached to his ($_shoto) own horse . Momo ($_momo) finds ingredients from her bag and Shoto lights the fire with his ($_shoto) magic , causing Ochako ($_ochako) to squeal with excitement as a fellow magic user .

He ($_momo) gives her a look at that , as if she s exposed one of his ($_momo) secrets . She smiles , and everyone else nods , complete with a soft mumbling of Momo ($_momo) under their breath . 
 Call me Shoto ($_shoto) . Please. 
  Well , now introductions are over , I suggest we make dinner . The sun will be setting soon , and we don t want to be cooking in the dark . I ll go look for firewood . Ochako ($_ochako) , perhaps you d care to accompany me ? Momo ($_momo) offers , and Ochako ($_ochako) nods aggressively , clearly pleased by the taller girl s invitation . The two wander off into the woods , leaving the three boys staring at each other .

Really , you ($_iida) ve been the talk of the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) . 
 Well. We ... we , uh ... Shoto ($_shoto) tries to explain , but his ($_shoto) words fail him ($_shoto) . It s not something he ($_shoto) particularly wants to talk about . 
 I don t see how it s any of your ($_iida) business why he ($_shoto) left , Momo ($_momo) fills in , coming to his ($_shoto) defence as she so often does . 
 Because it s my duty to protect him ($_shoto) , she says simply , folding her arms . 
 We re not taking you ($_iida) to the capital , Shoto ($_shoto) says , suddenly changing the topic of conversation . 
 My father has no interest in the_central_kingdom ($_the) , or anything other than himself , for that matter , Shoto ($_shoto) points out , his voice cold . 
 They sit by a stream and wash their other clothes in the rapidly moving water , filling up bottles a little way upstream so they can drink later . Once their clothes are cleaned , Momo ($_momo) wrings the water out of them before hanging them up on a makeshift washing line she fashions out of a ball of string found in the bottom of her bag .

I mean , Shoto ($_shoto) clarifies , he ($_fuyumi) must know I ve run away , since there would be no signs of an abduction , and he ($_fuyumi) knows I hated living with him ($_fuyumi) . 
 Shoto ($_shoto) walks past her , and she swivels on her heel to keep up with him . He stands in front of the other three , and they all look up at him expectantly . He swallows hard before speaking , his voice coming out in an uncharacteristic croak . 
 We ll have to take a long way round . There s no way either of us can walk right up to the crown city and not be noticed , Shoto ($_shoto) explains , sitting down again , this time visibly more relaxed . 
 They lie in content silence for a while , Shoto ($_shoto) drumming his ($_shoto) fingers against the ground , barely audible . A gentle breeze passes by them , moving the grass and ruffling Shoto ($_shoto) s hair so he ($_shoto) has to take time to fix it into his ($_shoto) usual style . He ($_shoto) rolls onto his ($_shoto) side , gazing at Momo , who s eyes remain staunchly upwards , either ignoring the boy at her side or unaware of his ($_shoto) eyes on her . In the distance , she hears a branch crack , as if someone stepped on it , and she s on her feet in moments , looking around desperately for the_culprit ($_shoto) . Shoto ($_shoto) begrudgingly sits upright , his ($_shoto) eyes fixed on her as she tries to figure out what s going on . 
 Where? He ($_shoto) says , scrambling to his ($_shoto) feet . He ($_shoto) knows the dangers - anyone who didn t already know of him ($_shoto) is well aware of who he ($_shoto) is due to the fact that his ($_shoto) face has been plastered on missing posters all around the_kingdom ($_the) . 
 Someone s coming , she says bluntly , as if he ($_shoto) couldn t have figured that out for himself ($_shoto) . You should hide somewhere . 
 How will you find me ? You won t know where I am , he ($_shoto) points out , and she can only smile sadly . 
 It s my job , Shoto ($_shoto) . 
  He ($_shoto) walks away with a sigh , and as he ($_shoto) goes , she climbs up into one of the trees her washing line is strung from . She balances herself on one of the branches and closes her eyes , putting on the facade of sleeping . She s read about people hiding in trees in books , although she doubts its effectiveness in real life . Although her eyes are closed , her ears are still working perfectly , and the longer she waits , the more sound she hears . There are footsteps - three pairs , if she s correct , and occasionally the mumble of voices . As the footsteps get closer to her , she can make out what the voices are saying . After introductions are done , Momo ($_momo) leaves them with her belongings and runs off in the direction Shoto ($_shoto) wandered off . He ($_momo) is predictable , and she finds him ($_momo) within moments of leaving their camp . He ($_momo) s seated on the ground below a particularly large oak , and she sits beside him ($_momo) , catching her breath . He ($_momo) looks worried for a second , and puts his ($_momo) hand on her forearm . 
 My ... my ... travelling partner , she eventually settles on , not really sure how to describe her and Shoto ($_shoto) s relationship . They weren t exactly friends , since she still mostly regarded him in a professional light . 
  This statement piques Shoto ($_shoto) s interest . If three kingdoms are suffering , and their kingdom isn t , perhaps he will have to take matters into his own hands . He was completely against the idea of going back home at the beginning , but the more they explain the situation to him , the more he realises just how sheltered his childhood was .

Momo ($_momo) elbows him ($_shoto) in the side , and he ($_shoto) begins paying attention as the green haired boy begins his ($_shoto) explanation . 
 You ($_iida) ll have to make a good case for yourself ($_iida) , Shoto ($_shoto) says , softening ever so slightly - the_short_girl ($_iida) had a point . Tell me what your ($_iida) problem is . But there s no guarantee I ll help you ($_iida) . 
 Their border is closed . Their monarchy leaves for diplomatic events , but otherwise no one gets in or out , Iida ($_iida) explains , and Shoto ($_shoto) s eyes fall to his ($_shoto) knees . 
 

($_iida)	You ($_iida) re the talk of the country , Uraraka ($_uraraka) says . There s articles in almost every newspaper about you ($_iida) . 
 I would usually ask how you ($_iida) knew who I was , but I assume the posters were a giveaway , Shoto ($_shoto) says . 
 I thought that s how you ($_iida) were supposed to greet royals ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , his ($_midoriya) face flushed in embarrassment . 
 What are you ($_iida) doing ? Shoto ($_shoto) asks , his ($_shoto) voice betraying him ($_shoto) with a tone of disgust . 
  I ll tell them no , he ($_momo) says , getting to his ($_momo) feet and offering his ($_momo) hand to help her up . She takes it , pulling herself up , and the two of them walk back together .

Really , you ($_iida) ve been the talk of the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) . 
 I don t see how it s any of your ($_iida) business why he ($_shoto) left , Momo ($_momo) fills in , coming to his ($_shoto) defence as she so often does . 
 Why did you ($_iida) leave ? Uraraka ($_uraraka) asks , her eyes wide with curiosity . 
 We re not taking you ($_iida) to the capital , Shoto ($_shoto) says , suddenly changing the topic of conversation . 
 We really need to speak with your ($_iida) father , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . He ($_midoriya) s the only person that can fix the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) s problem ! 
 It would be rude to call you by your first name , though , Iida ($_iida) points out . You re royalty , and we re ... not . 
 Iida ($_iida) , do you ($_iida) know her ? The girl asks . 
 I don t know how much you ($_iida) know , Prince_Todoroki_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) begins , tying his ($_midoriya) fingers in knots . But the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) has been in disarray since King_Toshinori ($_king) died . No one has taken the throne so the_kingdom ($_the) is in chaos - there are thieves everywhere , gangs in the capital . There s poverty everywhere you look , and I m worried that there ll be a civil war if nothing is done about it . 
 You ($_iida) ll have to make a good case for yourself ($_iida) , Shoto ($_shoto) says , softening ever so slightly - the_short_girl ($_iida) had a point . Tell me what your ($_iida) problem is . But there s no guarantee I ll help you ($_iida) . 
 We ll manage to get there even if you ($_iida) don t bring us , Uraraka ($_uraraka) points out . It would just be easier and a lot quicker if we had someone to bring us . 
 Their border is closed . Their monarchy leaves for diplomatic events , but otherwise no one gets in or out , Iida ($_iida) explains , and Shoto ($_shoto) s eyes fall to his ($_shoto) knees . 
 

($_the)	 I think we should . I feel like ... my father is hiding something from me . How is the fact that our_kingdom ($_the) is the only one visibly intact not suspicious ? You have an accent from the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) , though , the taller boy with blue hair points out . 
 The rumours surrounding your ($_iida) disappearance are quite outrageous , Iida ($_iida) agrees . Kidnapping , running away , you ($_iida) two eloping as secret lovers - Shoto ($_shoto) starts a little at this , while Momo ($_momo) raises an unconvinced eyebrow . Really , you ($_iida) ve been the talk of the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) . 
 We really need to speak with your ($_iida) father , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . He ($_midoriya) s the only person that can fix the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) s problem ! 
 My father has no interest in the_central_kingdom ($_the) , or anything other than himself , for that matter , Shoto ($_shoto) points out , his voice cold . 
 Where? He ($_shoto) says , scrambling to his ($_shoto) feet . He ($_shoto) knows the dangers - anyone who didn t already know of him ($_shoto) is well aware of who he ($_shoto) is due to the fact that his ($_shoto) face has been plastered on missing posters all around the_kingdom ($_the) . 
  Since the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) s fall , Uraraka ($_uraraka) interrupts , trying to salvage Midoriya ($_midoriya) s explanation . He ($_uraraka) was visibly shaking , nervous under the prince s cold stare . Other kingdoms have been suffering too . A whole village in the_Eastern_Kingdom ($_the) fell - the place where the king and queen were living . They were killed ! The_Western_Kingdom ($_the) has been suffering too - the poverty levels there have increased dramatically since imports from the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) have ceased . We don t have good enough land there to farm a lot of our own crops , and we rely on imports from other kingdoms . And what do you expect my father to do about that ? He s not a miracle worker . He can t undo ten years of damage that your_kingdom ($_the) has done to itself ($_the) . 
 I don t know how much you ($_iida) know , Prince_Todoroki_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) begins , tying his ($_midoriya) fingers in knots . But the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) has been in disarray since King_Toshinori ($_king) died . No one has taken the throne so the_kingdom ($_the) is in chaos - there are thieves everywhere , gangs in the capital . There s poverty everywhere you look , and I m worried that there ll be a civil war if nothing is done about it . 
 No one has heard anything from the_Southern_Kingdom_in_years ($_the) , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says quietly . 
 

($_midoriya)	I thought that s how you ($_iida) were supposed to greet royals ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , his ($_midoriya) face flushed in embarrassment . 
 I m sorry , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , rapidly moving away from the prince . 
  I ll tell them no , he ($_momo) says , getting to his ($_momo) feet and offering his ($_momo) hand to help her up . She takes it , pulling herself up , and the two of them walk back together . As soon as they make it to the clearing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) gasps , his ($_midoriya) eyes falling on the prince . Looking round at the sound , Iida ($_iida) and Uraraka ($_uraraka) gasp too .  Shoto rolls his ($_iida) eyes at their reactions , until Midoriya ($_midoriya) closes the distance between them , dropping to his ($_iida) knees and taking Shoto s hand , placing a kiss on the back of it . The prince looks horrified , and Momo ($_momo) gently pushes Midoriya ($_midoriya) away . Iida ($_iida) s face is painted in confusion and Uraraka ($_uraraka) only laughs . Why do you even care ? You would ve been , what ... three , when King_Toshinori ($_king) died ? He ($_king) says , directing the question at Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
 I was eight , Midoriya ($_midoriya) answers , his ($_midoriya) brows furrowing . Shoto ($_shoto) does the maths in his ($_shoto) head - that makes Midoriya ($_midoriya) older than both him ($_shoto) and Momo ($_momo) , even if he ($_shoto) thought he ($_shoto) looked younger . 
 Then ... perhaps we should all call each other by our first names , Midoriya ($_midoriya) suggests quietly . I mean , it would be strange that we call Sh-Shoto by his ($_midoriya) first name and no one else . 
 Why not? Midoriya ($_midoriya) asks , speaking up for the first time since his ($_midoriya) embarrassment earlier . 
 We really need to speak with your ($_iida) father , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . He ($_midoriya) s the only person that can fix the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) s problem ! 
 Thank you so much , Prince Todoroki , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , his ($_midoriya) eyes bright and excited for the next stage in his ($_midoriya) journey . 
  Since the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) s fall , Uraraka ($_uraraka) interrupts , trying to salvage Midoriya ($_midoriya) s explanation . He ($_uraraka) was visibly shaking , nervous under the prince s cold stare . Other kingdoms have been suffering too . A whole village in the_Eastern_Kingdom ($_the) fell - the place where the king and queen were living . They were killed ! The_Western_Kingdom ($_the) has been suffering too - the poverty levels there have increased dramatically since imports from the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) have ceased . We don t have good enough land there to farm a lot of our own crops , and we rely on imports from other kingdoms . I don t know how much you ($_iida) know , Prince_Todoroki_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) begins , tying his ($_midoriya) fingers in knots . But the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) has been in disarray since King_Toshinori ($_king) died . No one has taken the throne so the_kingdom ($_the) is in chaos - there are thieves everywhere , gangs in the capital . There s poverty everywhere you look , and I m worried that there ll be a civil war if nothing is done about it . 
 They sit down on the ground in a semi circle , Shoto ($_shoto) sitting as far away from Midoriya ($_midoriya) as he ($_shoto) can . He ($_shoto) can tell that his ($_shoto) reaction to the boy has made him ($_shoto) uncomfortable , but for someone to kiss his ($_shoto) hand in such a situation outside of the court was strange , and he ($_shoto) hoped deep down that he ($_shoto) would never have to go through that again . Momo ($_momo) elbows him ($_shoto) in the side , and he ($_shoto) begins paying attention as the green haired boy begins his ($_shoto) explanation . 
 No one has heard anything from the_Southern_Kingdom_in_years ($_the) , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says quietly . 
 

($_ochako)	 Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) reappear and find the boys still sitting awkwardly on the grass . Shoto ($_shoto) at least has made himself ($_shoto) helpful - readying the pot that was attached to his ($_shoto) own horse . Momo ($_momo) finds ingredients from her bag and Shoto lights the fire with his ($_shoto) magic , causing Ochako ($_ochako) to squeal with excitement as a fellow magic user . He ($_shoto) can t help but smile at her enthusiasm , and sits back when Momo ($_momo) throws chopped up vegetables and their leftover meat from the last town they stopped in . Tenya ($_tenya) adds water , and they sit back , waiting patiently for their meal to cook .  Well , now introductions are over , I suggest we make dinner . The sun will be setting soon , and we don t want to be cooking in the dark . I ll go look for firewood . Ochako ($_ochako) , perhaps you d care to accompany me ? Momo ($_momo) offers , and Ochako ($_ochako) nods aggressively , clearly pleased by the taller girl s invitation . The two wander off into the woods , leaving the three boys staring at each other . Tenya ($_tenya) and Izuku swap looks , taking it in turn to look at Shoto ($_shoto) and wonder just how lucky they got to bump into him . 

($_king)	Why do you even care ? You would ve been , what ... three , when King_Toshinori ($_king) died ? He ($_king) says , directing the question at Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
 I don t know how much you ($_iida) know , Prince_Todoroki_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) begins , tying his ($_midoriya) fingers in knots . But the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) has been in disarray since King_Toshinori ($_king) died . No one has taken the throne so the_kingdom ($_the) is in chaos - there are thieves everywhere , gangs in the capital . There s poverty everywhere you look , and I m worried that there ll be a civil war if nothing is done about it . 
 

($_uraraka)	You ($_iida) re the talk of the country , Uraraka ($_uraraka) says . There s articles in almost every newspaper about you ($_iida) . 
  I ll tell them no , he ($_momo) says , getting to his ($_momo) feet and offering his ($_momo) hand to help her up . She takes it , pulling herself up , and the two of them walk back together . As soon as they make it to the clearing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) gasps , his ($_midoriya) eyes falling on the prince . Looking round at the sound , Iida ($_iida) and Uraraka ($_uraraka) gasp too .  Shoto rolls his ($_iida) eyes at their reactions , until Midoriya ($_midoriya) closes the distance between them , dropping to his ($_iida) knees and taking Shoto s hand , placing a kiss on the back of it . The prince looks horrified , and Momo ($_momo) gently pushes Midoriya ($_midoriya) away . Iida ($_iida) s face is painted in confusion and Uraraka ($_uraraka) only laughs . Then I suppose I m okay with you all calling me Ochako , Uraraka ($_uraraka) nods , and Momo ($_momo) gives her an encouraging smile . 
 Why did you ($_iida) leave ? Uraraka ($_uraraka) asks , her eyes wide with curiosity . 
 You ve known each other for years , though ! Uraraka ($_uraraka) exclaims . 
 Really? Uraraka ($_uraraka) asks , clasping her ($_uraraka) hands together in elation . 
  Since the_Central_Kingdom ($_the) s fall , Uraraka ($_uraraka) interrupts , trying to salvage Midoriya ($_midoriya) s explanation . He ($_uraraka) was visibly shaking , nervous under the prince s cold stare . Other kingdoms have been suffering too .

We don t have good enough land there to farm a lot of our own crops , and we rely on imports from other kingdoms . We ll manage to get there even if you ($_iida) don t bring us , Uraraka ($_uraraka) points out . It would just be easier and a lot quicker if we had someone to bring us . 
 

($_tenya)	 Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) reappear and find the boys still sitting awkwardly on the grass .
