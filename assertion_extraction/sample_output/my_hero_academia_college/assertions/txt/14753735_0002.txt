($_omega)	Um well from what I remember . Betas and Omega ($_omega) s live there . The_Alpha ($_the) would then challenge a Beta and Omega ($_omega) pair bond to a duel . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) laughed . They let Omega ($_omega) s fight ? 
 Dragon Born Izuku glanced towards the book . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a dragon born , he ($_kirishima) always thought it was just a name there was no denying that he ($_kirishima) was different . He ($_kirishima) had sharp teeth , he ($_kirishima) could harden his ($_kirishima) skin and he ($_kirishima) could change his ($_kirishima) scent to both Alpha and Omega ($_omega) and had other characteristics of those genders . -LRB- At least he ($_kirishima) claimed he ($_kirishima) did -RRB- He ($_kirishima) picked up the book and abandoned the soup . 
 

($_dragon)	Dragon_Aizawa ($_dragon) answer and knelt beside him ($_izuku) . I ($_dragon) want you to translate this there is a question you must answer . 
 

($_izuku)	So , your first reaction was too run in here like a mad dog ? Izuku ($_izuku) put his ($_izuku) hands on his ($_izuku) hips To protect me ? 
 Kirishima and Izuku ($_izuku) both turned and looked down at the_Alpha ($_the) . Kirishima cheeks went pink and he ($_bakugou) scratched the back of his ($_bakugou) head . I didn t expect him ($_bakugou) to be so manly looking . He ($_bakugou) whispered . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) pinched the bridge of his ($_izuku) nose . Control yourself 
 Izuku ($_izuku) straightened his ($_izuku) posture , faith in his ($_izuku) abilities always made him ($_izuku) happy . Is it truly important the question in this book ? If you believe I can take care of myself shouldn t my duty be to protect this village continue first and foremost ? 
 The two walked side by side . Izuku ($_izuku) s mother hut was on the opposite side of the village near the forest . The trees offered plenty of shade and protection and his mother enjoyed nature , although Izuku ($_izuku) had always speculated it was because she felt like an outsider , even after all this time . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) nodded . Do you not wish to do it ? His ($_aizawa) brow lifted and Izuku ($_izuku) shook his ($_aizawa) head . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) made a face . Something like this would takes months , he ($_izuku) had maybe a few weeks . He ($_izuku) did like a challenge and he ($_izuku) was curious about the question he ($_izuku) needed to answer within this book . Can I take this with me ? 
 He ($_izuku) had intended to stop by and make sure that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was treating the_Alpha ($_the) as the dangerous beast he ($_izuku) was and not a possible new friend and Aizawa ($_aizawa) must have known that . If you must Izuku ($_izuku) reached down and pick up the box that contain the book . 
 How so? Izuku ($_izuku) picked his ($_izuku) soup back up . 
 Men rode Dragons ($_dragons) ? Izuku ($_izuku) turned towards his ($_izuku) mother . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) laughed . They let Omega ($_omega) s fight ? 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) is more likely going to try to befriend him ($_kirishima) than guard him ($_kirishima) ! Izuku ($_izuku) exclaimed . It was true that he ($_izuku) had extended the offer to share his ($_izuku) first heat with the Beta so obviously he ($_izuku) trusted him ($_izuku) , but he ($_izuku) knew his ($_izuku) short comings . He ($_izuku) was extremely curious and friendly unless provoked . 
 No . Izuku ($_izuku) folded his ($_izuku) arms . Kirishima ($_kirishima) is overly affectionate . He ($_izuku) cleared his ($_izuku) throat . And I had extended the offer to share my heat with him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) s eager . 
 Oh , my gods ! Izuku ($_izuku) pushed Kirishima ($_kirishima) out the hut . Go find out what Aizawa ($_aizawa) wanted 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) winked and completely ignored Izuku ($_izuku) . Hey you bonded ? 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) along with Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to the hut nearly an hour later . Aizawa ($_aizawa) requested a word with Midoriya ($_midoriya) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) was left in his ($_kirishima) stead to watch the_Alpha ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) stepped outside the hut , he ($_kirishima) was thankful to get fresh air . The Alpha pheromones were starting to make his ($_kirishima) head hurt . 
 Not here. Izuku ($_izuku) muttered and he ($_izuku) became more guarded . Although the_Alpha ($_the) was injured he ($_izuku) came from a world by his ($_izuku) own account that Omegas were owned and held no rights . He ($_izuku) couldn t trust him ($_izuku) , he ($_izuku) couldn t let himself ($_izuku) forget what he ($_izuku) was . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) blushed , he ($_izuku) wasn t used to Omega s speaking so openly about their heats . Omega s have nothing to offer , everything they have is taken . 
  I guess you will just have to translate it and find out yourself if it was worth it He ($_izuku) placed his ($_izuku) hand on his ($_izuku) shoulder . When you find this question don t think about your duty . I want you to think about as an Omega , as yourself and decide what your answer will be Aizawa turned , Izuku ($_izuku) s hut was only a few feet away . His ($_izuku) mother was outside stirring a pot that smelled like rabbit . If he ($_izuku) didn t leave he ($_izuku) would be invited to stay and he ($_izuku) wanted to avoid that at all cost . Izuku ($_izuku) nodded , that had made him ($_izuku) more curious than ever , but he ($_izuku) had more pressing matters . He ($_izuku) set the book down and slowly approached his ($_izuku) mother . He ($_izuku) was careful not to step on a single twig or dried leaf as he ($_izuku) approached her from behind . 
 I could smell you the moment you returned to the village , Izuku ($_izuku) . Do you not think I could smell you right behind me ? She chuckled . Izuku ($_izuku) wrapped his ($_izuku) arms from behind around her and nuzzled into her neck . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) claimed he ($_aizawa) caught too many again . She turned and reached up touching Izuku ($_izuku) s hair . Izuku ($_izuku) stood still as his ($_izuku) mother inspected him ($_izuku) . Her unseeing eyes never blinked as her hands gently touched his ($_izuku) face and examined his ($_izuku) neck . 
 I wasn t bitten Izuku muttered . I wouldn t let him ($_izuku) I mean he ($_izuku) didn t even try . He ($_izuku) s very hurt 
 I know She leaned up and kissed his ($_izuku) cheek . Please tell Aizawa ($_aizawa) next time that you see him ($_izuku) that he ($_izuku) s getting too thin and he ($_izuku) needs to stop pretending he ($_izuku) s such a great hunter and giving me his ($_izuku) catches . I am content with what I can gather on my own . 
 He ($_izuku) won t listen to me Izuku ($_izuku) leaned down and smelled the soup . 
 He ($_izuku) just feels guilty . She laughed . When we first met he ($_izuku) kicked me so hard . 
 Izuku brow wrinkle Why did you kick you . I thought he ($_izuku) found you and bought you here ? 
 Izuku ($_izuku) push his ($_izuku) bottom into Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hip and with a quick squat he ($_izuku) lifted while pulling his ($_izuku) arm forward . 
  Kirishima lungs burnt by the time he ($_aizawa) reached the village . He ($_aizawa) sniffed the air and his ($_aizawa) feet begun to move towards the scent of the_Alpha ($_the) , breaking into a sprint again he ($_aizawa) leaped into Chiyo s hut like a wild animal . Izuku ($_izuku) reacted immediately when the hut was breached . He ($_izuku) stepped into the intruder grabbing his ($_izuku) shoulders . He ($_izuku) turned and stepped away from him ($_izuku) while at the same time pulling him ($_izuku) towards him ($_izuku) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was off balance now , Izuku ($_izuku) had him ($_izuku) by the arm and knew from their sparring that this wasn t a good position . Izuku ($_izuku) rolled him ($_izuku) off his ($_izuku) hip and flipped him ($_izuku) straight over his ($_izuku) back . The wind was knocked right out of him ($_izuku) when his ($_izuku) slammed against the floor . Izuku ($_izuku) twisted his ($_izuku) arm backwards pushing Bakugou ($_bakugou) back down when the_Alpha ($_the) had attempted to sit up . Bakugou ($_bakugou) snapped his ($_bakugou) teeth at the_Omega ($_the) but he ($_bakugou) didn t have the strength to fight back . Izuku ($_izuku) panted heavily and starred down at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) called out but he ($_izuku) was already in the motion . 
  You are the fool that was planted on his ($_kirishima) back Izuku countered , his ($_kirishima) eyes soften and shook his ($_kirishima) head . Kirishima ($_kirishima) grinned and quickly got to his ($_kirishima) feet . He ($_kirishima) buried his ($_kirishima) nose into the crook of his ($_kirishima) neck , Izuku ($_izuku) always smelled good but being so close to his ($_kirishima) heat made him ($_kirishima) especially alluring . In a month maybe less Izuku ($_izuku) would go into heat , it was driving him ($_kirishima) mad . He ($_kirishima) kissed right where his ($_kirishima) scent gland was and then rubbed against him ($_kirishima) . He ($_kirishima) really liked when Izuku ($_izuku) smelled like him ($_kirishima) but Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t in the mood for scenting and pushed him ($_kirishima) away . Dragon_Aizawa ($_dragon) answer and knelt beside him ($_izuku) . I ($_dragon) want you to translate this there is a question you must answer . 
  And the question is in here ? Izuku ($_izuku) tilted his ($_izuku) head .  He ($_izuku) had translated many books , he ($_izuku) had the vast knowledge of his ($_izuku) previous incarnations , but this language was old . He ($_izuku) had no memory of it . Some of his ($_izuku) past lives gave up their knowledge and experience willing , while others he ($_izuku) had to mediate and use the pipe to connect with and there were two he ($_izuku) has never spoken too . The first and the One for All before him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) couldn t connect to them , Aizawa ($_aizawa) believed it would take time but Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t sure that inexperience was the problem . Izuku ($_izuku) closed the book and his ($_izuku) fingers traced the outside again . It s hard like rock but smells like animal hide . I m not entirely sure . 
  It ($_vellum) is both smooth and durable . Izuku ($_izuku) has never seen one of this quality . The preparation was impeccable . This is old . Izuku ($_izuku) leaned down and sniffed at the pages . They finished it with by abrading the surface with pumice and a treatment of He ($_izuku) looked up and grinned Lime .  Leave Kirishima ($_kirishima) to his ($_aizawa) duty . You have your own He ($_aizawa) held open the door and Izuku ($_izuku) realized that they were in front of Aizawa ($_aizawa) personal hut .  His ($_aizawa) hut was small and secluded , nestled against the mountain side . Aizawa ($_aizawa) was a private person and rarely entertained . He ($_aizawa) glanced up at the council member and with permission he ($_aizawa) stepped inside . Aizawa ($_aizawa) often left the safety of the village . He ($_aizawa) travelled far for trade and information and often bought back books and scrolls . Izuku ($_izuku) had read a great many , but there were a few that he ($_aizawa) was itching to get his ($_aizawa) hands on . Aizawa ($_aizawa) walked past him ($_aizawa) and went to the corner of his ($_aizawa) hut . He ($_aizawa) tossed aside a few furs and grabbed a metal box . It appeared heavy as he ($_aizawa) lifted it and walked it towards him ($_aizawa) carefully . He ($_aizawa) set it on the ground at his ($_aizawa) feet and Izuku ($_izuku) instantly knelt beside it . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) placed his ($_aizawa) hand on Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulder and guided him ($_aizawa) away from the hut . He ($_aizawa) knew that Midoriya ($_midoriya) would likely resist this order . He ($_aizawa) was stubborn when he ($_aizawa) thought he ($_aizawa) was doing the right thing but there was more to this than Midoriya ($_midoriya) realized . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) glanced towards the hut where Kacchan was being held . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a capable warrior but he ($_aizawa) was far too trusting . His ($_aizawa) brow tightened but he ($_aizawa) allowed Aizawa ($_aizawa) guided him ($_aizawa) . 
  I ($_inko) ve heard that story_Izuku ($_izuku) smiled . I ($_inko) can t believe he kicked you no wonder he brings you rabbits . Izuku ($_izuku) huffed . Oh I ($_inko) left my ($_inko) book outside . Izuku ($_izuku) put down his ($_izuku) soup and ran out to fetch his ($_izuku) book . He ($_izuku) bought it inside and set it beside his ($_izuku) mother . Feel the cover .  Oh no . Inko ($_inko) stirred the pot and then tasted the soup . He ($_inko) gestured for Izuku ($_izuku) to fetch the bowls . He ($_inko) quickly did as she instructed and touched her hand gently so that she knew that bowl was right beneath her bowl . She poured them both some soup . Izuku ($_izuku) carried the bowls inside so that they could eat in peace . 

($_dragons)	Dragon all the Dragons ($_dragons) were killed over a hundred years ago . Inko ($_inko) opened the pages and gently touched the pages . My ($_inko) grandfather told me ($_inko) stories about them and the men that rode them . 
 Men rode Dragons ($_dragons) ? Izuku ($_izuku) turned towards his ($_izuku) mother . 
 

($_bakugou)	 Bakugou ($_bakugou) jerked away . Fucking freak . He ($_bakugou) growled angrily . He ($_bakugou) started to lose his ($_bakugou) color and Kirishima ($_kirishima) instantly grabbed him ($_bakugou) . Alright Stud lets go lay down . I think that s enough excitement for today Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to normal . I m sorry ! It s a natural reaction . He ($_bakugou) grabbed Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand and examined it for cuts . Aizawa ($_aizawa) said it s a part of my ($_aizawa) clan are you ($_aizawa) hurt ? 
  Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes darted between the two . He ($_bakugou) had no idea what the hell was going on . The red hair one had charged into the hut like he ($_bakugou) was going into battle . When he ($_bakugou) breached the door way he ($_bakugou) smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) but now his ($_bakugou) scent resembled more of a beta and that green hair omega had flipped him ($_bakugou) like it was nothing . That wasn t luck , that was strength and training . Kirishima and Izuku ($_izuku) both turned and looked down at the_Alpha ($_the) . Kirishima cheeks went pink and he ($_bakugou) scratched the back of his ($_bakugou) head . I didn t expect him ($_bakugou) to be so manly looking . He ($_bakugou) whispered . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) cheeks burned Shut the fuck up , stop looking 
 Nah , I m just going to share his heat . I intend on having hundreds of kids . I m going to populate the world with my red headed pups ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) helped Bakugou ($_bakugou) lifted his ($_bakugou) pants once he ($_bakugou) was finished . 
 I know , this would just be for fun He ($_bakugou) gestured between them . I can produce slick it will be fun . 
  You can produce what ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed the tree for support . What the fuck was this guy . He ($_bakugou) had sworn he ($_bakugou) smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) , but he ($_bakugou) was obviously a beta and he ($_bakugou) claims to produce slick . He ($_bakugou) had seen powerful and strange individuals . There was many half Demons in the world with great power , but he ($_bakugou) has never heard of a Beta that sometimes smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) and could produce slick .  I can smell like an_Alpha ($_alpha) and Omega . I can produce some slick , and I even have a knot . He ($_bakugou) opened up his ($_bakugou) trousers . You want to see Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled and smacked him ($_bakugou) across the head , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) instantly harden and Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouted in pain . He ($_bakugou) stumbled backwards barely able to grab a tree before he ($_bakugou) fell . Kirishima entire was hard like a stone . 
 Just look away. Bakugou ($_bakugou) demanded . He ($_bakugou) waited as Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled him ($_bakugou) free and reached down , relieving his ($_bakugou) bladder . 
 I don t give a shit about that . Bakugou ($_bakugou) glared . He ($_bakugou) killed my men . I had to listen to their screams as birds pecked out their eyes and pulled out their guts . 
 I would too if he ($_bakugou) did that to me 
  Bakugou ($_bakugou) turned red I didn t do it myself ! He ($_bakugou) shouted loudly . Endeavor the Demon King . When anyone that crossed him ($_bakugou) , he ($_bakugou) bites and mounts like an omega , but that fucker hasn t been able to get it up for years . He ($_bakugou) used the wall to balance himself ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) bit me and tried to shame me . Like you fucking could , I could kick your ass in the state I am in and I don t want any of your damn omegas . Bakugou ($_bakugou) muttered . He ($_bakugou) closed his ($_bakugou) eyes when he ($_bakugou) felt the sun on his ($_bakugou) face . I m going to kill Endeavor . 
 That s not very manly Kirishima ($_kirishima) walked long side him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) opened the door to the hut and waited for him ($_bakugou) to step outside . Just stay away from people , especially the Omega s. Otherwise I get to beat you up 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) was very curious about the_Alpha ($_the) . He ($_kirishima) was able to mimic the scents of other genders but he ($_kirishima) had always wondered how his ($_kirishima) scent compared to the real deal . Bakugou ($_bakugou) slowly got up , his ($_bakugou) wounds had been treated but did nothing for the pain . 
 I need to piss shit for brains just fucking move . He ($_bakugou) took a couple of steps limping the entire way . 
 He ($_bakugou) got to his ($_bakugou) feet and went pale . Kirishima ($_kirishima) jumped up and grabbed a hold of him ($_bakugou) . Whoa there buddy . Don t pass out 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) jerked away from him ($_bakugou) . Don t touch me 
 You two bonded ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) inquired . The red headed beta had been very touchy feeling with the_Omega ($_the) . . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) blushed , he ($_izuku) wasn t used to Omega s speaking so openly about their heats . Omega s have nothing to offer , everything they have is taken . 
 Then go die Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled and slowly pushed himself ($_kirishima) up . His ($_kirishima) body was sore as hell , but he ($_kirishima) needed to relieve himself ($_kirishima) . 
 Stop fucking talking to me ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) finally snapped at the redheaded Beta . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) rolled him ($_izuku) off his ($_izuku) hip and flipped him ($_izuku) straight over his ($_izuku) back . The wind was knocked right out of him ($_izuku) when his ($_izuku) slammed against the floor . Izuku ($_izuku) twisted his ($_izuku) arm backwards pushing Bakugou ($_bakugou) back down when the_Alpha ($_the) had attempted to sit up . Bakugou ($_bakugou) snapped his ($_bakugou) teeth at the_Omega ($_the) but he ($_bakugou) didn t have the strength to fight back . Izuku ($_izuku) panted heavily and starred down at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) slowly made his ($_bakugou) way behind the hut . He ($_bakugou) struggled with his ($_bakugou) pants and nearly fell twice . Bro ($_bro) just let me help Kirishima ($_kirishima) grabbed his ($_bro) shoulder and steadied him ($_bro) . Gon na pull your pants down and you can do the rest . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) s eyes widen , there was nothing he ($_bakugou) could say to that . He ($_bakugou) instead gestured to the woods . As good as place as any 
 

($_a)	 The world hasn t always been a cruel place for our kind Izuku , in the Dragon clan they were equal . The_Alpha ($_the) would have to defeat them and if he did . He would join their pair bond . My grandfather said it was about balance and then the Beta would become a_Dragon ($_a) . She laughed . Well Dragon Rider s were all Alphas but not everyone in the clan could have a_Dragon ($_a) . They had to pass a test . They had to leave their village , with nothing but their clothes on their backs . They would have to travel across the country to reach their sister tribe . 
 

($_the)	Kirishima and Izuku ($_izuku) both turned and looked down at the_Alpha ($_the) . Kirishima cheeks went pink and he ($_bakugou) scratched the back of his ($_bakugou) head . I didn t expect him ($_bakugou) to be so manly looking . He ($_bakugou) whispered . 
 He ($_izuku) had intended to stop by and make sure that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was treating the_Alpha ($_the) as the dangerous beast he ($_izuku) was and not a possible new friend and Aizawa ($_aizawa) must have known that .

 Kirishima ($_kirishima) will take over guarding the_Alpha ($_the) . 
 You two bonded ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) inquired . The red headed beta had been very touchy feeling with the_Omega ($_the) . . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) along with Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to the hut nearly an hour later .

($_vellum)	 Vellum ($_vellum) ? He ($_aizawa) glanced up at Aizawa ($_aizawa) and he ($_aizawa) nodded approvingly .  Vellum ($_vellum) is made from the skin of a calf .  It ($_vellum) is both smooth and durable . Izuku ($_izuku) has never seen one of this quality . The preparation was impeccable . This is old . Izuku ($_izuku) leaned down and sniffed at the pages . They finished it with by abrading the surface with pumice and a treatment of He ($_izuku) looked up and grinned Lime .

Izuku ($_izuku) stepped outside the hut , he ($_kirishima) was thankful to get fresh air . The Alpha pheromones were starting to make his ($_kirishima) head hurt . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) brought an_Alpha ($_alpha) to the village .

He ($_aizawa) knew that Midoriya ($_midoriya) would likely resist this order . He ($_aizawa) was stubborn when he ($_aizawa) thought he ($_aizawa) was doing the right thing but there was more to this than Midoriya ($_midoriya) realized . 
 

($_bro)	Bakugou ($_bakugou) slowly made his ($_bakugou) way behind the hut . He ($_bakugou) struggled with his ($_bakugou) pants and nearly fell twice . Bro ($_bro) just let me help Kirishima ($_kirishima) grabbed his ($_bro) shoulder and steadied him ($_bro) . Gon na pull your pants down and you can do the rest . 
 

($_aizawa)	Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to normal . I m sorry ! It s a natural reaction . He ($_bakugou) grabbed Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand and examined it for cuts . Aizawa ($_aizawa) said it s a part of my ($_aizawa) clan are you ($_aizawa) hurt ? 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) said there was an_Alpha ($_alpha) . So I came . 
 What did exactly did he ($_aizawa) tell you ? 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) sighed That is a concern council shares , you have never been near a true Alpha but I don t have doubts about your ability to control your biology . Aizawa ($_aizawa) rubbed the back of the neck . And if he ($_aizawa) can t control his ($_aizawa) I know you are strong enough to prevent anything 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) nodded . Do you not wish to do it ? His ($_aizawa) brow lifted and Izuku ($_izuku) shook his ($_aizawa) head . 
 He ($_izuku) had intended to stop by and make sure that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was treating the_Alpha ($_the) as the dangerous beast he ($_izuku) was and not a possible new friend and Aizawa ($_aizawa) must have known that . If you must Izuku ($_izuku) reached down and pick up the box that contain the book . 
 Of course . In fact , I ll walk you to your mother s hut Aizawa ($_aizawa) offered . 
 Oh , my gods ! Izuku ($_izuku) pushed Kirishima ($_kirishima) out the hut . Go find out what Aizawa ($_aizawa) wanted 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) along with Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to the hut nearly an hour later . Aizawa ($_aizawa) requested a word with Midoriya ($_midoriya) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) was left in his ($_kirishima) stead to watch the_Alpha ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) stepped outside the hut , he ($_kirishima) was thankful to get fresh air . The Alpha pheromones were starting to make his ($_kirishima) head hurt . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) claimed he ($_aizawa) caught too many again . She turned and reached up touching Izuku ($_izuku) s hair . Izuku ($_izuku) stood still as his ($_izuku) mother inspected him ($_izuku) . Her unseeing eyes never blinked as her hands gently touched his ($_izuku) face and examined his ($_izuku) neck . 
 I know She leaned up and kissed his ($_izuku) cheek . Please tell Aizawa ($_aizawa) next time that you see him ($_izuku) that he ($_izuku) s getting too thin and he ($_izuku) needs to stop pretending he ($_izuku) s such a great hunter and giving me his ($_izuku) catches . I am content with what I can gather on my own . 
 You re needed in the village . Aizawa ($_aizawa) eyes drifted to the children . They were chatting excitedly about the fish , some of them were sticking out their lips to mimic the fish she had caught . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) opened his ($_aizawa) mouth but the Beta took off in a full sprint towards the village . Idiot He ($_aizawa) rolled his ($_aizawa) eyes and turned towards the abandon children . Time to go home He ($_aizawa) ordered . The children complained loudly as they gathered their fishing poles . 
  Kirishima lungs burnt by the time he ($_aizawa) reached the village .

The first and the One for All before him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) couldn t connect to them , Aizawa ($_aizawa) believed it would take time but Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t sure that inexperience was the problem . What of the cover ? Aizawa ($_aizawa) inquired . 
 Inside was a single thick book that he ($_aizawa) has never seen before . He ($_aizawa) traced over the top of the book , it felt like a stone that had been washed smooth on the bottom of the river bed . The pages were made from parchments folded and sewn into strong cords that were attached to wooden boards . 
  Vellum ($_vellum) ? He ($_aizawa) glanced up at Aizawa ($_aizawa) and he ($_aizawa) nodded approvingly .  Leave Kirishima ($_kirishima) to his ($_aizawa) duty . You have your own He ($_aizawa) held open the door and Izuku ($_izuku) realized that they were in front of Aizawa ($_aizawa) personal hut .

It appeared heavy as he ($_aizawa) lifted it and walked it towards him ($_aizawa) carefully . He ($_aizawa) set it on the ground at his ($_aizawa) feet and Izuku ($_izuku) instantly knelt beside it . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) placed his ($_aizawa) hand on Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulder and guided him ($_aizawa) away from the hut . He ($_aizawa) knew that Midoriya ($_midoriya) would likely resist this order . He ($_aizawa) was stubborn when he ($_aizawa) thought he ($_aizawa) was doing the right thing but there was more to this than Midoriya ($_midoriya) realized . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) glanced towards the hut where Kacchan was being held . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a capable warrior but he ($_aizawa) was far too trusting . His ($_aizawa) brow tightened but he ($_aizawa) allowed Aizawa ($_aizawa) guided him ($_aizawa) . 
 The other children surrounded the little omega girl and cheered as she placed the fish in the water and it swim away . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stood up and met Aizawa ($_aizawa) half way . He ($_kirishima) kept an eye on the pups , although the magical borders kept them safe from other tribes there were still many other dangers for ones so little . 
 He ($_aizawa) stayed with me ($_inko) as you were born and he ($_aizawa) told me ($_inko) that you glowed but even though I ($_inko) couldn t see you I ($_inko) could feel it She ($_inko) set her ($_inko) bowl down and wiped the tears from her ($_inko) eyes . They told me ($_inko) that when an infant glows it was a sign that they were in the incarnation of the previous One for All and it has been over a hundred years since one was born . 
  She ($_inko) laughed . Aizawa ($_aizawa) kicked me ($_inko) so hard I ($_inko) went into labor . He ($_aizawa) didn t realize I ($_inko) was a pregnant Omega , he ($_aizawa) just thought I ($_inko) was an intruder That it is but the moment you came into this world Izuku . It was worth it . Inko ($_inko) sipped the soup slowly . Aizawa ($_aizawa) did find me ($_inko) first but he ($_aizawa) didn t bring me ($_inko) here . I ($_inko) found this place on my ($_inko) own . 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) claims it s a Dragon he ($_aizawa) wants me ($_inko) to translate it but it s very old . 
 

($_alpha)	 Bakugou ($_bakugou) s eyes darted between the two . He ($_bakugou) had no idea what the hell was going on . The red hair one had charged into the hut like he ($_bakugou) was going into battle . When he ($_bakugou) breached the door way he ($_bakugou) smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) but now his ($_bakugou) scent resembled more of a beta and that green hair omega had flipped him ($_bakugou) like it was nothing . That wasn t luck , that was strength and training . That s enough of that . His ($_kirishima) cheeks were burning , and he ($_kirishima) refused to glance at the_Alpha_behind_him ($_alpha) him ($_kirishima) . What were you thinking ? 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) said there was an_Alpha ($_alpha) . So I came . 
 There was an_Alpha ($_alpha) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) repeated . 
  You can produce what ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) grabbed the tree for support . What the fuck was this guy . He ($_bakugou) had sworn he ($_bakugou) smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) , but he ($_bakugou) was obviously a beta and he ($_bakugou) claims to produce slick . He ($_bakugou) had seen powerful and strange individuals . There was many half Demons in the world with great power , but he ($_bakugou) has never heard of a Beta that sometimes smelled like an_Alpha ($_alpha) and could produce slick .  I can smell like an_Alpha ($_alpha) and Omega . I can produce some slick , and I even have a knot . He ($_bakugou) opened up his ($_bakugou) trousers . You want to see Oh , I believed it when I was pup . I thought it was so romantic that an_Alpha ($_alpha) would travel the entire country just to find it 's mates ... I always kept looking for my own Dragon born beta . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) brought an_Alpha ($_alpha) to the village . 
 

($_kirishima)	 Bakugou ($_bakugou) jerked away . Fucking freak . He ($_bakugou) growled angrily . He ($_bakugou) started to lose his ($_bakugou) color and Kirishima ($_kirishima) instantly grabbed him ($_bakugou) . Alright Stud lets go lay down . I think that s enough excitement for today Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to normal . I m sorry ! It s a natural reaction . He ($_bakugou) grabbed Bakugou ($_bakugou) s hand and examined it for cuts . Aizawa ($_aizawa) said it s a part of my ($_aizawa) clan are you ($_aizawa) hurt ? 
 Of course not . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rubbed the back of his ($_kirishima) head . I wanted to see the fight maybe join in . 
 That s enough of that . His ($_kirishima) cheeks were burning , and he ($_kirishima) refused to glance at the_Alpha_behind_him ($_alpha) him ($_kirishima) . What were you thinking ? 
 There was an_Alpha ($_alpha) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) repeated . 
 She made a face but did as instructed . Kirishima ($_kirishima) placed the small fish in her hand . Go release it 
 Nah , I m just going to share his heat . I intend on having hundreds of kids . I m going to populate the world with my red headed pups ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) helped Bakugou ($_bakugou) lifted his ($_bakugou) pants once he ($_bakugou) was finished . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled and smacked him ($_bakugou) across the head , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) instantly harden and Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouted in pain . He ($_bakugou) stumbled backwards barely able to grab a tree before he ($_bakugou) fell . Kirishima entire was hard like a stone . 
 Just look away. Bakugou ($_bakugou) demanded . He ($_bakugou) waited as Kirishima ($_kirishima) pulled him ($_bakugou) free and reached down , relieving his ($_bakugou) bladder . 
 He ($_izuku) had intended to stop by and make sure that Kirishima ($_kirishima) was treating the_Alpha ($_the) as the dangerous beast he ($_izuku) was and not a possible new friend and Aizawa ($_aizawa) must have known that . If you must Izuku ($_izuku) reached down and pick up the box that contain the book . 
 That s not very manly Kirishima ($_kirishima) walked long side him ($_bakugou) . He ($_bakugou) opened the door to the hut and waited for him ($_bakugou) to step outside . Just stay away from people , especially the Omega s. Otherwise I get to beat you up 
  The omega stood up and rapidly pulled in her line as fast as her tiny arms could pull . Kirishima ($_kirishima) didn t offer any assistance , she was out of the nursery and needed to learn she could do things for herself . She cried out in disgust and delight as the small fish flopped on the riverbed . Kirishima ($_kirishima) chuckled and gestured for her along with the others to watch . He ($_kirishima) grabbed the fish preventing it from getting injured .  The little girl was hesitant to touch the fish but Kirishima ($_kirishima) encourage her gently , but his eyes averted upwards . Someone was approaching from upwind . He was certain that it was Aizawa and his muscles relaxed . Bend the hook Kirishima instructed as he kept his eyes towards the council member . And push it back through Kirishima ($_kirishima) shrugged . I was told to be your shadow , there are a few places you definitely can t go but I see no reason you got ta stay in here 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) was very curious about the_Alpha ($_the) . He ($_kirishima) was able to mimic the scents of other genders but he ($_kirishima) had always wondered how his ($_kirishima) scent compared to the real deal . Bakugou ($_bakugou) slowly got up , his ($_bakugou) wounds had been treated but did nothing for the pain . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) tilted his ($_kirishima) head . Do you want to walk around ? 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) huffed in annoyance . Go ahead and pass out and bust your face . Maybe breaking your nose and losing a couple teeth will cool your head 
 He ($_bakugou) got to his ($_bakugou) feet and went pale . Kirishima ($_kirishima) jumped up and grabbed a hold of him ($_bakugou) . Whoa there buddy . Don t pass out 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) is more likely going to try to befriend him ($_kirishima) than guard him ($_kirishima) ! Izuku ($_izuku) exclaimed . It was true that he ($_izuku) had extended the offer to share his ($_izuku) first heat with the Beta so obviously he ($_izuku) trusted him ($_izuku) , but he ($_izuku) knew his ($_izuku) short comings . He ($_izuku) was extremely curious and friendly unless provoked . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) will take over guarding the_Alpha ($_the) . 
 No . Izuku ($_izuku) folded his ($_izuku) arms . Kirishima ($_kirishima) is overly affectionate . He ($_izuku) cleared his ($_izuku) throat . And I had extended the offer to share my heat with him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) s eager . 
 Oh , my gods ! Izuku ($_izuku) pushed Kirishima ($_kirishima) out the hut . Go find out what Aizawa ($_aizawa) wanted 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) winked and completely ignored Izuku ($_izuku) . Hey you bonded ? 
 Aizawa ($_aizawa) along with Kirishima ($_kirishima) returned to the hut nearly an hour later . Aizawa ($_aizawa) requested a word with Midoriya ($_midoriya) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) was left in his ($_kirishima) stead to watch the_Alpha ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) stepped outside the hut , he ($_kirishima) was thankful to get fresh air . The Alpha pheromones were starting to make his ($_kirishima) head hurt . 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) shook his ($_kirishima) head . Little one must grow first we re going to throw it back . So , it can go big , have many babies , and then one day you ll catch it again . He ($_kirishima) promised . He ($_kirishima) reached out and took her hand and guided it to the fish . Hurry , we need to take out the hook . Then go die Bakugou ($_bakugou) growled and slowly pushed himself ($_kirishima) up . His ($_kirishima) body was sore as hell , but he ($_kirishima) needed to relieve himself ($_kirishima) . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) pouted and folded his ($_kirishima) arms . This sucks He ($_kirishima) sat on the floor . I don t want to watch you 
 Dragon Born Izuku glanced towards the book . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a dragon born , he ($_kirishima) always thought it was just a name there was no denying that he ($_kirishima) was different . He ($_kirishima) had sharp teeth , he ($_kirishima) could harden his ($_kirishima) skin and he ($_kirishima) could change his ($_kirishima) scent to both Alpha and Omega ($_omega) and had other characteristics of those genders . -LRB- At least he ($_kirishima) claimed he ($_kirishima) did -RRB- He ($_kirishima) picked up the book and abandoned the soup . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) rubbed the back of his ($_kirishima) neck , usually when he ($_kirishima) was needed it was grunt work . Can it wait , we just got started . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) push his ($_izuku) bottom into Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hip and with a quick squat he ($_izuku) lifted while pulling his ($_izuku) arm forward . 
  Kirishima lungs burnt by the time he ($_aizawa) reached the village . He ($_aizawa) sniffed the air and his ($_aizawa) feet begun to move towards the scent of the_Alpha ($_the) , breaking into a sprint again he ($_aizawa) leaped into Chiyo s hut like a wild animal . Izuku ($_izuku) reacted immediately when the hut was breached . He ($_izuku) stepped into the intruder grabbing his ($_izuku) shoulders . He ($_izuku) turned and stepped away from him ($_izuku) while at the same time pulling him ($_izuku) towards him ($_izuku) . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was off balance now , Izuku ($_izuku) had him ($_izuku) by the arm and knew from their sparring that this wasn t a good position . Izuku ($_izuku) rolled him ($_izuku) off his ($_izuku) hip and flipped him ($_izuku) straight over his ($_izuku) back . The wind was knocked right out of him ($_izuku) when his ($_izuku) slammed against the floor . Izuku ($_izuku) twisted his ($_izuku) arm backwards pushing Bakugou ($_bakugou) back down when the_Alpha ($_the) had attempted to sit up . Bakugou ($_bakugou) snapped his ($_bakugou) teeth at the_Omega ($_the) but he ($_bakugou) didn t have the strength to fight back . Izuku ($_izuku) panted heavily and starred down at Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) called out but he ($_izuku) was already in the motion . 
  You are the fool that was planted on his ($_kirishima) back Izuku countered , his ($_kirishima) eyes soften and shook his ($_kirishima) head . Kirishima ($_kirishima) grinned and quickly got to his ($_kirishima) feet . He ($_kirishima) buried his ($_kirishima) nose into the crook of his ($_kirishima) neck , Izuku ($_izuku) always smelled good but being so close to his ($_kirishima) heat made him ($_kirishima) especially alluring . In a month maybe less Izuku ($_izuku) would go into heat , it was driving him ($_kirishima) mad . He ($_kirishima) kissed right where his ($_kirishima) scent gland was and then rubbed against him ($_kirishima) . He ($_kirishima) really liked when Izuku ($_izuku) smelled like him ($_kirishima) but Izuku ($_izuku) wasn t in the mood for scenting and pushed him ($_kirishima) away .  Hey Izuku. Kirishima ($_kirishima) gasped for air . He ($_kirishima) pulled himself ($_kirishima) up to his ($_kirishima) knees and nuzzled affectionately against Izuku s thigh . He ($_kirishima) kissed his ($_kirishima) leg and glanced upwards innocently . Did I hurt you ? Bakugou ($_bakugou) slowly made his ($_bakugou) way behind the hut . He ($_bakugou) struggled with his ($_bakugou) pants and nearly fell twice . Bro ($_bro) just let me help Kirishima ($_kirishima) grabbed his ($_bro) shoulder and steadied him ($_bro) . Gon na pull your pants down and you can do the rest . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) s eyes widen , there was nothing he ($_bakugou) could say to that . He ($_bakugou) instead gestured to the woods . As good as place as any 
  Leave Kirishima ($_kirishima) to his ($_aizawa) duty . You have your own He ($_aizawa) held open the door and Izuku ($_izuku) realized that they were in front of Aizawa ($_aizawa) personal hut . Izuku ($_izuku) glanced towards the hut where Kacchan was being held . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was a capable warrior but he ($_aizawa) was far too trusting . His ($_aizawa) brow tightened but he ($_aizawa) allowed Aizawa ($_aizawa) guided him ($_aizawa) . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) yawned widely the children sitting next to him ($_kirishima) strained their necks to get a better look inside his ($_kirishima) mouth . He ($_kirishima) sharply turned and snapped . The little Omega next to him ($_kirishima) screamed and then begun to giggle . He ($_kirishima) grinned widely and poked her and gestured to her fishing pole . 
 The other children surrounded the little omega girl and cheered as she placed the fish in the water and it swim away . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stood up and met Aizawa ($_aizawa) half way . He ($_kirishima) kept an eye on the pups , although the magical borders kept them safe from other tribes there were still many other dangers for ones so little . 
 

($_inko)	Just stories I m sure . Inko ($_inko) was very young when her ($_inko) grandfather told her ($_inko) about Dragon Riders . I remember I thought the stories were romantic . 
 Dragon all the Dragons ($_dragons) were killed over a hundred years ago . Inko ($_inko) opened the pages and gently touched the pages . My ($_inko) grandfather told me ($_inko) stories about them and the men that rode them . 
  I ($_inko) ve heard that story_Izuku ($_izuku) smiled . I ($_inko) can t believe he kicked you no wonder he brings you rabbits . Izuku ($_izuku) huffed . Oh I ($_inko) left my ($_inko) book outside . Izuku ($_izuku) put down his ($_izuku) soup and ran out to fetch his ($_izuku) book . He ($_izuku) bought it inside and set it beside his ($_izuku) mother . Feel the cover . He ($_aizawa) stayed with me ($_inko) as you were born and he ($_aizawa) told me ($_inko) that you glowed but even though I ($_inko) couldn t see you I ($_inko) could feel it She ($_inko) set her ($_inko) bowl down and wiped the tears from her ($_inko) eyes . They told me ($_inko) that when an infant glows it was a sign that they were in the incarnation of the previous One for All and it has been over a hundred years since one was born . 
  Inko ($_inko) shrugged her ($_inko) shoulders . Went I ($_inko) got away I ($_inko) was scarred and just ran . I ($_inko) always believed that it was a spirit or god . Maybe it was One for All guiding me ($_inko) . It lead me ($_inko) up this mountain and into the village I ($_inko) caused quite a scare .  She ($_inko) laughed . Aizawa ($_aizawa) kicked me ($_inko) so hard I ($_inko) went into labor . He ($_aizawa) didn t realize I ($_inko) was a pregnant Omega , he ($_aizawa) just thought I ($_inko) was an intruder That it is but the moment you came into this world Izuku . It was worth it . Inko ($_inko) sipped the soup slowly . Aizawa ($_aizawa) did find me ($_inko) first but he ($_aizawa) didn t bring me ($_inko) here . I ($_inko) found this place on my ($_inko) own . 
 Are you sure I never told you this ? Inko ($_inko) blew on the soup . She knew with winter setting in that there wasn t going to be much meat on the menu , so she wasn t so quick to refuse his offering . 
  Oh no . Inko ($_inko) stirred the pot and then tasted the soup . He ($_inko) gestured for Izuku ($_izuku) to fetch the bowls . He ($_inko) quickly did as she instructed and touched her hand gently so that she knew that bowl was right beneath her bowl . She poured them both some soup . Izuku ($_izuku) carried the bowls inside so that they could eat in peace . Aizawa ($_aizawa) claims it s a Dragon he ($_aizawa) wants me ($_inko) to translate it but it s very old . 
 Oh. Inko ($_inko) was surprised by the texture . Is it an animal ? Such a thick hide .
