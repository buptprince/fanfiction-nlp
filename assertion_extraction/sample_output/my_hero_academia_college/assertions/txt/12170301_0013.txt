($_momo)	 He doesn t say anything , but offers a smile to him anyway . Shoto ($_shoto) gets up from his ($_shoto) seated position and finds cushions from the seats , lying on the ground and lifting the blanket that Momo ($_momo) left for him ($_shoto) . He ($_shoto) mumbles a quiet goodnight , before rolling on to his ($_shoto) side and closing his ($_shoto) eyes . Izuku ($_izuku) stays in front of the fire a little longer , not truly ready to face sleep yet . When they reach the side street , they see that Momo ($_momo) and Tenya ($_tenya) have joined them once more , having managed to secure accommodation for the night . Ochako ($_ochako) smiles and waves , brandishing the packages she ($_ochako) picked up . Truth be told , she ($_ochako) bought these disguises out of her ($_ochako) own funds , and she ($_ochako) fully intended to get reimbursed from the two once they completed whatever they planned to complete in the crown city . 
  She ($_ochako) hands the brown tunic and cloak to Shoto ($_shoto) to throw on over his fancy regal clothes , at least until they reach their inn . She ($_ochako) gives the wig to Tenya , and kindly asks the knight to assist Shoto ($_shoto) in covering his ($_shoto) hair and scar with it . Ochako ($_ochako) moves on to Momo ($_momo) next , handing her ($_ochako) the purple cloak . She ($_ochako) would ve bought more for her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) knew that she ($_ochako) would rather keep her ($_ochako) armour on in case of an emergency . Instead , she ($_ochako) takes Momo ($_momo) s hair down from her ($_ochako) functional yet distinct pony tail , and parts her ($_ochako) fringe on either side of her ($_ochako) head . Satisfied with her ($_ochako) work , Ochako ($_ochako) gives them a thumbs up and takes a step back with a grin on her ($_ochako) face .  The darker one , he ($_momo) huffs . She ($_ochako) turns back to the seller and picks out the darker purple cape and a tunic that s a light brown , as well as a dark brown coat . She ($_ochako) asks the owner sweetly if they d have such a thing as a wig , and they point the young mage in the right direction . The stall owner looks suspicious , but takes Ochako ($_ochako) s money and packages the clothes up , and the two head on their way , down to the back alley shop that the stall owner told them about . It s a little more than shady , but Ochako ($_ochako) makes her ($_ochako) purchase and heads back to the side street where she ($_ochako) left Izuku ($_izuku) and Shoto ($_shoto) , cutting through the main square , where everyone is beginning to pack up their wares .  Thanks to Ochako s disguises , they manage to make it to the inn without incident . Momo ($_momo) hands across payment after checking the booking is correct , and they head silently upstairs , the raven haired girl unable to resist the urge to tie her ($_ochako) hair back into her ($_ochako) usual pony tail . They separate into rooms as usual , although their rooms in this time are more akin to an apartment .  There are two bedrooms in their area this time , and a living room too , with a table and an open fire and plenty of seats . Ochako ($_ochako) is babbling away to Momo about how nice her ($_ochako) hair is , and Tenya ($_tenya) follows a grumbling Katsuki , pestering him ($_tenya) with a million questions . This leaves Shoto ($_shoto) and Izuku ($_izuku) in the living room alone . Shoto lights the fire , and the two boys sit in front of it , warming their hands . Momo ($_momo) has left them blankets to sleep under , but despite the warm weather outside , it s pretty chilly in the room .  A long time is spent in awkward silence as the group makes their way along the heavily forested path to the next town . Leaving the mountains far behind them , Izuku ($_izuku) would ve assumed that the alpine temperatures would ve changed . But the further north they go , the closer to the crown city they get , the colder the air becomes . It doesn t seem to bother Momo ($_momo) and Shoto ($_shoto) - hailing from the_kingdom_themselves ($_the) , they re used to the colder temperatures . Ochako ($_ochako) suffers the most - her ($_ochako) her_kingdom ($_the) is the most tropical in terms of climate , and shivers constantly seem to wrack her ($_ochako) body from the cold . None of her ($_ochako) layers of clothes seem to be enough , and Momo ($_momo) lets her ($_ochako) ride on her ($_ochako) horse , a blanket wrapped around her ($_ochako) to keep some heat in .  Vendors line the streets with their stalls , selling everything from clothes to food to trinkets . Tenya ($_tenya) and Momo ($_momo) head off to find accommodation for them , the two frequently being able to haggle with an innkeeper . The other four check out the stalls , looking but not buying for the most part . That is , until Shoto ($_shoto) realises which town this is , and hurriedly turns into a side street . Ochako ($_ochako) follows him ($_shoto) first ; to avoid suspicion , and eventually Izuku ($_izuku) and Katsuki ($_katsuki) , who still doesn t speak to them , head into the street . I m not worried about that , Shoto ($_shoto) mumbles , shaking his ($_shoto) head . I m worried about us getting caught . Myself and Momo ($_momo) , that is . People round here , from here until the crown city , they re bound to know us . Me more so than her , but still ... Momo_was_fairly_popular ($_momo) , and a lot of people from the castle come here to get supplies , as it s the best market for miles . 
  Yes , she ($_ochako) says with a pout , but that s not what I m going to do . If I see Momo ($_momo) , I ll send her ($_ochako) this way . You just make yourself comfortable ! She ($_ochako) turns to leave , before pausing . And you , she ($_ochako) adds , jabbing a finger to Katsuki s upper arm , are coming with me . He ($_izuku) opens his ($_izuku) mouth to argue with her ($_ochako) , but with a well timed glare and a shift of her ($_ochako) cloak to show the magic staff that she ($_ochako) stores under the many layers of fabric . He ($_izuku) pales , and agrees to follow her ($_ochako) , albeit with an angry expression . Which one of these purples would you think suits Momo ($_momo) best ? She ($_ochako) asks him ($_momo) , and all he ($_momo) can do is raise an eyebrow . 
 I ll have it sorted by the next town , I promise . I just need a little more time to figure things out . And I ll need to ask Momo ($_momo) too , since she knows the castle better than I do . 
 You seem to have some kind of plan in your head for when we reach the crown city . You hired Kacchan ($_kacchan) specifically to destroy the roof of the palace , yet you ve told no one what your plan is . Does Momo ($_momo) even know ? I thought you two were really close ? 
 

($_kacchan)	 . I would disagree , actually , Izuku ($_izuku) says , trying his ($_izuku) hardest to vouch for his ($_izuku) once friend . His ($_izuku) tone of voice lets him ($_izuku) down though , sounding less than convinced . Shoto ($_shoto) raises an eyebrow at the green haired boy , who struggles to find something good to say . He ($_izuku) s very dedicated . Kacchan ($_kacchan) won t let you ($_kacchan) down , I swear . I trust him ($_izuku) . Can I ask , Shoto ($_shoto) starts , but pauses quickly , wondering if the burning question on his ($_izuku) mind is really appropriate to ask . Can I ask ... what happened between you ($_kacchan) two ? Why does he ($_izuku) seem to hate you ($_kacchan) so much ? 
  Kacchan ($_kacchan) thought I was stupid because I couldn t do magic . Izuku ($_izuku) shrugs , a sheepish smile on his ($_izuku) face . One day , he ($_izuku) was fighting with another student and since he ($_izuku) couldn t control his ($_izuku) magic powers , he ($_izuku) ended up blowing up one of the school buildings up . He ($_izuku) was exiled after that , since the child he ($_izuku) was fighting with got really bad injuries . I never really saw the_other_guy ($_izuku) again .  Kacchan ($_kacchan) never liked me , Izuku ($_izuku) laughs , but it s sad , and Shoto ($_shoto) can only sigh . There s no need for Izuku ($_izuku) to be so optimistic , but somehow he ($_kacchan) manages it ($_izuku) anyway . He ($_kacchan) and I were always rivals in school , not that he ($_kacchan) ever really turned up . He ($_kacchan) was more interested in magic , but he ($_kacchan) wasn t ever truly able to control the magic ability he ($_kacchan) had . We fought a lot about that , since I also thought it was cool , but I have no magic in my blood . As far as I m aware , there s no magic in my family at all . Kacchan ($_kacchan) s mother was a sorceress , though . Kacchan ($_kacchan) ?

($_katsuki)	I don t doubt that , Tenya ($_tenya) quips , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) says a quiet tch under his ($_katsuki) breath . 
 You re fuckin persistent , Katsuki ($_katsuki) sighs . Why are you even trying to make friends with me ? 
 Oi , round face , Katsuki ($_katsuki) calls . 
  Vendors line the streets with their stalls , selling everything from clothes to food to trinkets . Tenya ($_tenya) and Momo ($_momo) head off to find accommodation for them , the two frequently being able to haggle with an innkeeper . The other four check out the stalls , looking but not buying for the most part . That is , until Shoto ($_shoto) realises which town this is , and hurriedly turns into a side street . Ochako ($_ochako) follows him ($_shoto) first ; to avoid suspicion , and eventually Izuku ($_izuku) and Katsuki ($_katsuki) , who still doesn t speak to them , head into the street . And? Katsuki ($_katsuki) barks , glaring at the prince . Is that not a good thing ? I thought our goal was to get to the crown city ? And now you re fucking worried ? 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) lies back down with a thump , facing the opposite way from Tenya ($_tenya) . The blue haired boy smiles - at last , progress.s 
 I don t know what happened with you and Izuku ($_izuku) in the past , and while I may not approve of your attitude , I hope that perhaps in the future we can become good friends . Tenya ($_tenya) holds his ($_tenya) hand out over the gap between the two beds , and after a moment of silence , there s a rustling of blankets as Katsuki ($_katsuki) turns over and firmly grasps the man s hand in his own , an unreadable expression on his face . 
 Well you can fuck off too , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says , but he ($_katsuki) has to hide a smile by turning over to face the wall . 
 Glasses , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says suddenly , amid the barrage of questions . Shut the fuck up , or I ll kill you . For the first time , Tenya ($_tenya) sees a crackle of magic in Katsuki ($_katsuki) s palm , and he ($_shoto) immediately shuts the fuck up . Though this doesn t last long , as this new element of Katsuki ($_katsuki) has Tenya ($_tenya) intrigued . 
 Magic ? Izuku ($_izuku) asks , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) s eyebrows raise . 
 Ochako ($_ochako) mulls over a stall selling clothes for almost half an hour , while Katsuki ($_katsuki) stands behind her ($_ochako) , arms folded , a glare permanently on his ($_katsuki) face . This stall holds clothes unlike anything she ($_ochako) s seen back home in the_Western_Kingdom ($_the) . Her ($_ochako) plan was to make disguises for Momo and Shoto ($_shoto) so they wouldn t be recognised . But she ($_ochako) s more surprised by the huge range of clothing they have , and the more she ($_ochako) pores over the stall , the more impatient both the stall owner and Katsuki ($_katsuki) become . 
 

($_izuku)	 You re a good person , Shoto ($_shoto) . I m sure you ll make an excellent ruler , Izuku ($_izuku) says with a smile . Shoto ($_shoto) looks mildly shocked , and his ($_shoto) face contorts into a million expressions before settling in a smile . Izuku doesn t fail to notice the prince s inner turmoil .  He doesn t say anything , but offers a smile to him anyway . Shoto ($_shoto) gets up from his ($_shoto) seated position and finds cushions from the seats , lying on the ground and lifting the blanket that Momo ($_momo) left for him ($_shoto) .

 I thought you were interested in magic ? Shoto jokes , but his ($_izuku) tone is serious as usual , and it takes Izuku ($_izuku) a moment to realise . 
 I don t know what happened with you and Izuku ($_izuku) in the past , and while I may not approve of your attitude , I hope that perhaps in the future we can become good friends .

 We ll be there soon , Izuku ($_izuku) reminds . You said earlier we we re only two towns away from your home . 
  The bed in this_inn ($_the) was a lot comfier than in the last by a wide margin , and he ($_shoto) could easily fall asleep , if it weren t for the talkative knight trying to find out everything about his ($_shoto) life from the very start .

  Meanwhile , Tenya ($_tenya) talks loudly at the brick wall that is Katsuki Bakugo .

 What am I to you ($_ochako) , a fucking meat shield ? He roars , and she ($_ochako) shakes her ($_ochako) head , dropping the conversation entirely .

Truth be told , she ($_ochako) bought these disguises out of her ($_ochako) own funds , and she ($_ochako) fully intended to get reimbursed from the two once they completed whatever they planned to complete in the crown city . 
  She ($_ochako) hands the brown tunic and cloak to Shoto ($_shoto) to throw on over his fancy regal clothes , at least until they reach their inn . She ($_ochako) gives the wig to Tenya , and kindly asks the knight to assist Shoto ($_shoto) in covering his ($_shoto) hair and scar with it . Ochako ($_ochako) moves on to Momo ($_momo) next , handing her ($_ochako) the purple cloak . She ($_ochako) would ve bought more for her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) knew that she ($_ochako) would rather keep her ($_ochako) armour on in case of an emergency . Instead , she ($_ochako) takes Momo ($_momo) s hair down from her ($_ochako) functional yet distinct pony tail , and parts her ($_ochako) fringe on either side of her ($_ochako) head . Satisfied with her ($_ochako) work , Ochako ($_ochako) gives them a thumbs up and takes a step back with a grin on her ($_ochako) face .  The darker one , he ($_momo) huffs . She ($_ochako) turns back to the seller and picks out the darker purple cape and a tunic that s a light brown , as well as a dark brown coat . She ($_ochako) asks the owner sweetly if they d have such a thing as a wig , and they point the young mage in the right direction . The stall owner looks suspicious , but takes Ochako ($_ochako) s money and packages the clothes up , and the two head on their way , down to the back alley shop that the stall owner told them about . It s a little more than shady , but Ochako ($_ochako) makes her ($_ochako) purchase and heads back to the side street where she ($_ochako) left Izuku ($_izuku) and Shoto ($_shoto) , cutting through the main square , where everyone is beginning to pack up their wares . Ochako ($_ochako) , she ($_ochako) corrects , and she ($_ochako) can hear him tut from behind her ($_ochako) . 
 Why did you ($_ochako) bring me with you ($_ochako) ? You ($_ochako) didn t need my help at all . 
  Thanks to Ochako s disguises , they manage to make it to the inn without incident . Momo ($_momo) hands across payment after checking the booking is correct , and they head silently upstairs , the raven haired girl unable to resist the urge to tie her ($_ochako) hair back into her ($_ochako) usual pony tail . They separate into rooms as usual , although their rooms in this time are more akin to an apartment .  There are two bedrooms in their area this time , and a living room too , with a table and an open fire and plenty of seats . Ochako ($_ochako) is babbling away to Momo about how nice her ($_ochako) hair is , and Tenya ($_tenya) follows a grumbling Katsuki , pestering him ($_tenya) with a million questions . This leaves Shoto ($_shoto) and Izuku ($_izuku) in the living room alone . Shoto lights the fire , and the two boys sit in front of it , warming their hands . Momo ($_momo) has left them blankets to sleep under , but despite the warm weather outside , it s pretty chilly in the room .  A long time is spent in awkward silence as the group makes their way along the heavily forested path to the next town . Leaving the mountains far behind them , Izuku ($_izuku) would ve assumed that the alpine temperatures would ve changed . But the further north they go , the closer to the crown city they get , the colder the air becomes . It doesn t seem to bother Momo ($_momo) and Shoto ($_shoto) - hailing from the_kingdom_themselves ($_the) , they re used to the colder temperatures . Ochako ($_ochako) suffers the most - her ($_ochako) her_kingdom ($_the) is the most tropical in terms of climate , and shivers constantly seem to wrack her ($_ochako) body from the cold . None of her ($_ochako) layers of clothes seem to be enough , and Momo ($_momo) lets her ($_ochako) ride on her ($_ochako) horse , a blanket wrapped around her ($_ochako) to keep some heat in . Is something the matter ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , noticing the panicked expression on the prince s face . 
  Vendors line the streets with their stalls , selling everything from clothes to food to trinkets . Tenya ($_tenya) and Momo ($_momo) head off to find accommodation for them , the two frequently being able to haggle with an innkeeper . The other four check out the stalls , looking but not buying for the most part . That is , until Shoto ($_shoto) realises which town this is , and hurriedly turns into a side street . Ochako ($_ochako) follows him ($_shoto) first ; to avoid suspicion , and eventually Izuku ($_izuku) and Katsuki ($_katsuki) , who still doesn t speak to them , head into the street . Don t worry , Ochako ($_ochako) says , a prize winning grin on her ($_ochako) face . I can fix this for both of you . 
 Well , not just us two . I wager Ochako ($_ochako) and Tenya ($_tenya) will be helpful too . I have no idea about ... 
 Ochako ($_ochako) mulls over a stall selling clothes for almost half an hour , while Katsuki ($_katsuki) stands behind her ($_ochako) , arms folded , a glare permanently on his ($_katsuki) face . This stall holds clothes unlike anything she ($_ochako) s seen back home in the_Western_Kingdom ($_the) . Her ($_ochako) plan was to make disguises for Momo and Shoto ($_shoto) so they wouldn t be recognised . But she ($_ochako) s more surprised by the huge range of clothing they have , and the more she ($_ochako) pores over the stall , the more impatient both the stall owner and Katsuki ($_katsuki) become . 
  Yes , she ($_ochako) says with a pout , but that s not what I m going to do . If I see Momo ($_momo) , I ll send her ($_ochako) this way . You just make yourself comfortable ! She ($_ochako) turns to leave , before pausing . And you , she ($_ochako) adds , jabbing a finger to Katsuki s upper arm , are coming with me . He ($_izuku) opens his ($_izuku) mouth to argue with her ($_ochako) , but with a well timed glare and a shift of her ($_ochako) cloak to show the magic staff that she ($_ochako) stores under the many layers of fabric . He ($_izuku) pales , and agrees to follow her ($_ochako) , albeit with an angry expression . Which one of these purples would you think suits Momo ($_momo) best ? She ($_ochako) asks him ($_momo) , and all he ($_momo) can do is raise an eyebrow . 
 Momo , Ochako ($_ochako) repeats , but his expression doesn t change . Dark hair . Ponytail . Shouted at you last night , she ($_ochako) explains . 
  Meanwhile , Tenya ($_tenya) talks loudly at the brick wall that is Katsuki Bakugo . His ($_shoto) outing with Ochako ($_ochako) earlier in the_day ($_the) had exhausted his ($_shoto) social skills , and all he ($_shoto) wanted to do was crawl under the covers and put his ($_shoto) head on the pillow and fall fast asleep . 

($_tenya)	I don t doubt that , Tenya ($_tenya) quips , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) says a quiet tch under his ($_katsuki) breath .

 Katsuki ($_katsuki) lies back down with a thump , facing the opposite way from Tenya ($_tenya) . The blue haired boy smiles - at last , progress.s 
 I don t know what happened with you and Izuku ($_izuku) in the past , and while I may not approve of your attitude , I hope that perhaps in the future we can become good friends . Tenya ($_tenya) holds his ($_tenya) hand out over the gap between the two beds , and after a moment of silence , there s a rustling of blankets as Katsuki ($_katsuki) turns over and firmly grasps the man s hand in his own , an unreadable expression on his face . 
 Glasses , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says suddenly , amid the barrage of questions . Shut the fuck up , or I ll kill you . For the first time , Tenya ($_tenya) sees a crackle of magic in Katsuki ($_katsuki) s palm , and he ($_shoto) immediately shuts the fuck up . Though this doesn t last long , as this new element of Katsuki ($_katsuki) has Tenya ($_tenya) intrigued .
