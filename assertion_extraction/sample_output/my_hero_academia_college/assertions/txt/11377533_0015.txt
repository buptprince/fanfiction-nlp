($_midoriya)	A sob echoes from behind him ($_toshinori) , and he ($_toshinori) doesn t have to turn to know that tears are streaming down young Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , that Ochako ($_ochako) has fallen to her ($_ochako) knees as well , that the small group of students that flew dragons out to fight an unbeatable foe are grieving as one . 
 Yagi_Toshinori ($_yagi) stumbles through the ashes , gasping for breath as blood builds up behind his ($_yagi) teeth . He ($_yagi) remembers seeing young Bakugou plummet from the sky like Icarus , knocked from his ($_yagi) dragon by the tail of the beast , and he ($_yagi) remembers seeing Uraraka ($_uraraka) held back by young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) as she ($_uraraka) tried to run into the flames . He ($_yagi) remembers tears running down the faces of his ($_yagi) young students as they curl into each other , their dragons sheltering them and blocking them from the flames whenever they get too close . 
 

($_uraraka)	Yagi_Toshinori ($_yagi) stumbles through the ashes , gasping for breath as blood builds up behind his ($_yagi) teeth . He ($_yagi) remembers seeing young Bakugou plummet from the sky like Icarus , knocked from his ($_yagi) dragon by the tail of the beast , and he ($_yagi) remembers seeing Uraraka ($_uraraka) held back by young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) as she ($_uraraka) tried to run into the flames . He ($_yagi) remembers tears running down the faces of his ($_yagi) young students as they curl into each other , their dragons sheltering them and blocking them from the flames whenever they get too close . 
 

($_katsuki)	Katsuki ($_katsuki) scowls slightly . Why am I here , anyway ? What is this place ? 
 If I go back ? he ($_katsuki) repeats warily . Hiccup nods . 
 Quiet , you , don t even start , the older Katsuki ($_katsuki) scolds , flicking the copper dragon s horn . You won t be laughing when we crush you in Dragon Racing . Striker ($_striker) roars her ($_bakugou) approval , flicking her ($_bakugou) tail . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) looks up -- and he ($_katsuki) stiffens , because he ($_katsuki) s looking at himself ($_katsuki) . 
 He ($_katsuki) halts on the edge of the cliffs , staring out over the empty ocean . The sky and the sea are almost the same shade , the two blending together into a cloudless , ship-less expanse of blue-green . Katsuki ($_katsuki) hesitates , fingers twitching restlessly as he ($_katsuki) gazes out over what looks to be an endless ocean . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) frowns , untangling his ($_katsuki) hand and knotting them in the grass . If He ($_katsuki) shakes his ($_katsuki) head . Why should I keep living , if all of that pain is waiting ? He ($_katsuki) fully intends to , of course , out of sheer fucking stubbornness , but he ($_katsuki) wants a reason , something to look forward to other than future dragon persecution and the possibility of war . 
 Do you have to be so fucking cryptic ? he ($_katsuki) complains , dropping down beside Hiccup , who laughs . The noise isn t amused so much as it s sad , but it s genuine . 
 The_brown-haired_man ($_katsuki) shrugged . A lot of hard stuff , he ($_katsuki) says seriously . Peace doesn t come easily . Neither does war , and both of them are on the horizon . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) narrows his ($_katsuki) eyes . What the hell does come next ? 
 If. You just fell into the flaming carcass of a dragon , you know . You might not survive ... and death might be easier than what comes next , he ($_katsuki) admits . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) knots his ($_katsuki) hands in his ($_katsuki) lap , subdued . ...and? 
  Katsuki ($_katsuki) watches them leave , amazed , only to freeze as the older Katsuki pauses by the door and looks him ($_katsuki) in the eye , a wry grin crossing his ($_katsuki) face . It gets so good , kid , his ($_katsuki) older self tells him ($_katsuki) . Just fuckin hang in there , and we ll meet a helluva lot sooner than ya might think .  Striker ($_striker) warbles at him ($_katsuki) , and he ($_katsuki) rests a palm on her head . Yeah , yeah , I m coming . The ash-blond glances back at him ($_katsuki) with a sharp smile . Now , if you ll excuse us , we have a race to win . And the scene vanishes , and he ($_katsuki) s sitting on the edge of a cliff , staring over the open ocean . That just happened . 
 Hiccup ($_hiccup) nods and Toothless rubs against him ($_katsuki) gently . The resemblance to Striker is well , striking , and heartbreaking as well . Katsuki ($_katsuki) scowls . And ... I spoke to myself . 
 Your older self spoke to you , corrects his ($_katsuki) ancestor . 
 Hiccup ($_hiccup) tilts his ($_katsuki) head , before snorting with amusement . I suppose not . So , are you going back or not ? 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) scoffs , baring his ($_katsuki) teeth slightly with a snarl . Of fuckin course I am . He ($_katsuki) got to his ($_katsuki) feet , explosions sparking in his ($_katsuki) palms . He ($_katsuki) turns to leave , noting that his ($_katsuki) hands and feet are swiftly going fucking transparent , of all things -- a sign that he ($_katsuki) s finally going back , maybe ? 
 He ($_katsuki) glances over his ($_katsuki) shoulder . Hiccup s green eyes are as far away as the stars , Toothless s wings tented over him ($_katsuki) . A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice , but it s home . He ($_katsuki) tilts his ($_katsuki) head back . It s our home . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) sits up , eyes widening fractionally as he ($_katsuki) takes in his ($_katsuki) surroundings . It looks like his ($_katsuki) island , his ($_katsuki) village , but it s not -- it can t be . Bright colors decorate banners and rooftops , patterned like dragon scales . A glittering building plated in some silvery metal and multicolored glass has been built into the side of a mountain , accompanied by something that looks like a stable , but for something at least several times larger than a horse . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) shakes his ($_katsuki) head , trying to clear it , and makes his ($_katsuki) way down to the docks . Maybe he ($_katsuki) can take a ship to the Nest , find out what happened -- except he ($_katsuki) should be fucking dead , shouldn t he ($_katsuki) ? How the ever-living fuck did I get here , then ? 
 And why the hell is that ? he ($_katsuki) growls , baring his ($_katsuki) teeth . The Night Fury -- Toothless , where the fuck has he ($_katsuki) heard that name before ? -- snorts and flicks his ($_katsuki) ear-flaps . 
  Not quite , the voice chuckles , and the wing is pushed aside , revealing a snarling Night Fury and a smiling someone of about twenty . Down, Toothless. The dragon whines , looking remarkably like his ($_katsuki) Striker , and the_man ($_berk) rests a reassuring hand on its ($_berk) -- his ($_berk) -- head . It ($_berk) s okay , bud , he ($_katsuki) assures the Night Fury . It ($_berk) s just his ($_katsuki) natural reaction . He ($_katsuki) can t really hurt us anyway .  Katsuki ($_katsuki) stares at him ($_berk) for a moment , but concedes that it s the only explanation that makes any fucking sense . Why else would Berk ($_berk) look like it did in his ($_berk) darkest dreams ? Why else would there be gods-damned dragon stables , of all things , next to a newly rebuilt U.A. ? The_man ($_berk) gives him ($_katsuki) a disgustingly easy smile , sitting down with the dragon at his ($_berk) side . Because we re dead . 
 You kidding ? Your betting pool is one of the largest out there , a new voice calls , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) -- and older , stronger Kirishima , face painted red and orange -- pads into view . Catalyst is out there distracting your adoring fans , along with Cryo and Shouto ($_shouto) . Katsuki ($_katsuki) blinks at that , because first name basis , how the fuck did they end up on first name basis ? 
  Midoriya Izuku , about four years older -LRB- and fucking taller than Katsuki ($_katsuki) is now , goddamnit -RRB- , lopes through the doorway , Viridi at his heels . The dark green Night Fury preens at the girl s adoring squeak , and Deku ($_deku) laughs , waving at the pair as he makes his way over . He s in full hero costume , excluding his mask , and his face is painted with a thousand shades of green and black and red , the designs mimicked on his dragon s wings . Looks like we re famous , he calls to a tall woman with long brown hair . She turns , and -- Ochako ($_ochako) ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) squeaks -- yes , squeaks , because what the fuck she looks different -- and good , really good , but that s not the gods-damned point . 
 Viridi is totally gon na win , the_boy ($_deku) says confidently . I ($_katsuki) ve put my ($_katsuki) savings on him ($_deku) and Deku ($_deku) . 
 Are you ($_katsuki) kidding me ($_katsuki) ? It s definitely gon na be S -- oh my ($_katsuki) gods that s him ($_deku) ! the girl squeals , and her dragon s ruff flares as if to mimic her excitement as the doors open . 
 His ($_katsuki) ancestor smiles . Well , if this soon-to-be reality version of Berk ($_berk) wasn t enough ... he ($_katsuki) hums , waving his ($_katsuki) hand . A misty room forms around them , eerily like the entrance hall in U.A. , but different -- there s more light , streaming through panes of colored glass . There are Terrible Terrors and other small dragons flying about , clinging to the rafters . 
 He ($_katsuki) snaps his ($_katsuki) fingers , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) leans forward as everything starts to move . Sound erupts in his ($_katsuki) ears , breathless laughter and dragon roars , yelps of annoyance from younger students that come running through , Nadders and Zipplebacks on their heels . A pair of older kids walk out into the sunshine , a Terror curled on the taller one s shoulder as a Hobblegrunt trails after her , an abnormally small Shockjaw padding behind the_shorter_boy_as_they ($_deku) chatter eagerly . The Dragon Riders are racing today ! the girl whispers as they pass the trio of Hiccup , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , and Toothless . The original seven , can you ($_katsuki) believe it ? Who are you ($_katsuki) betting on ? 
  He ($_katsuki) whirls around , lunging forward and dealing out an explosion immediately . His ($_katsuki) target dodges , sidestepping easily as a black wing springs up like a shield . Katsuki ($_katsuki) recoils , tensing as a -LRB- n all-too fucking familiar -RRB- growl echoes . Striker ($_striker) ? he ($_katsuki) demands . Katsuki ($_katsuki) blinks , and the world goes black . 
 That s true , he ($_katsuki) thinks , and grins sharply . His ($_katsuki) entire body is shimmering in and out of existence now , but his ($_katsuki) ancestor s words echo in his ($_katsuki) ears . 
 His ($_katsuki) forearms are turning transparent as well , but he ($_katsuki) pauses , listening . 
 

($_toshinori)	He ($_toshinori) s allowed this to happen , and now a child -- a hero -- is dead . 
 Because of him ($_toshinori) . 
 A sob echoes from behind him ($_toshinori) , and he ($_toshinori) doesn t have to turn to know that tears are streaming down young Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , that Ochako ($_ochako) has fallen to her ($_ochako) knees as well , that the small group of students that flew dragons out to fight an unbeatable foe are grieving as one . 
 Oh , gods , he ($_toshinori) breathes , pressing his ($_toshinori) hands to his ($_toshinori) knees as he ($_toshinori) bows his ($_toshinori) head . I did this . 
  Bakugou ($_bakugou) ! He ($_toshinori) stares at the boy for a moment .  His ($_toshinori) face is peaceful in unconsciousness -LRB- or ... death ? -RRB- , despite his ($_toshinori) soot-covered body ; his ($_toshinori) left leg is utterly mangled , torn up by claw and teeth marks , and broken in a dozen places . It s ugly , bruised and blackened and it ll probably have to be amputated , but he ($_toshinori) can t bring himself ($_toshinori) to care . Toshinori ($_toshinori) gathers him ($_toshinori) gently into his ($_toshinori) arms , pressing his ($_toshinori) ear to his ($_toshinori) chest . A weak noise escapes the Night Fury s throat as it -- she -- shifts , blinking open bleary white-gold eyes . The black dragon flares her nostrils , gaze reproachful -LRB- as if he ($_toshinori) needs a reminder of how badly he ($_toshinori) s failed her rider -RRB- . He ($_toshinori) watches at her , unable to speak . Her stare is frigid , as hard as diamond . 
 I m sorry , he ($_toshinori) manages , tears pricking in his ($_toshinori) eyes . I m so , so sorry . 
 Cheers ring out behind him ($_toshinori) , and he ($_toshinori) rests his ($_toshinori) skeletal hand on the dragon s neck . Thank you , he ($_toshinori) murmurs , for saving him ($_toshinori) . 
 His ($_toshinori) heartbeat stutters for barely a moment , but it picks up again , strong as ever . Toshinori ($_toshinori) lets out a choked cry , relief sweeping over him ($_toshinori) as he ($_toshinori) clutches his ($_toshinori) student closer . He ($_toshinori) s alive ! he ($_toshinori) whispers , opening his ($_toshinori) eyes to gaze at the dragon who saved Bakugou s life . You brought him ($_toshinori) back alive ! 
 Well , Aizawa observes , and Toshinori ($_toshinori) resists the urge to jump and attack the near-silent man . The dry-eyed hero glances meaningfully at Bakugou s ruined left leg before finishing with : Most of him . 
 Toshinori ($_toshinori) drops to his ($_toshinori) knees , muscle form finally gone as he ($_toshinori) spits blood onto the ground , grief pounding in his ($_toshinori) chest like a dull throb as he ($_toshinori) stares hopelessly at the Night Fury -- the Night Fury , who is still breathing -- barely . 
 

($_striker)	An_older_Bakugou_Katsuki ($_bakugou) trots down the stairs , Striker ($_striker) - -- Striker ($_striker) , she ($_bakugou) s alive and well , thank the gods -- at his ($_striker) side . The_younger_Katsuki ($_the) follows his ($_the) older version s movements -- fluid , almost graceful strides , a feral grace like the one within the dragon beside him ($_the) portrayed in his ($_the) every movement -- eyes widening as he ($_the) catches sight of the prosthetic where his ($_the) left foot should be . Cerulean paint outlines Striker ($_striker) s silver markings , and silver and blue swirls across her ($_bakugou) wings and tail , and she ($_bakugou) wears a new prosthetic with the image of a curled-up Night Fury stitched into it . His ($_the) own face is painted as well , silver swirling across it in an exact mirror of Striker s markings . Scars litter his ($_the) arms and collarbone , but they re born proudly , as are the few that mark Striker s ear-flaps . 
 Quiet , you , don t even start , the older Katsuki ($_katsuki) scolds , flicking the copper dragon s horn . You won t be laughing when we crush you in Dragon Racing . Striker ($_striker) roars her ($_bakugou) approval , flicking her ($_bakugou) tail . 
  Striker ($_striker) warbles at him ($_katsuki) , and he ($_katsuki) rests a palm on her head . Yeah , yeah , I m coming . The ash-blond glances back at him ($_katsuki) with a sharp smile . Now , if you ll excuse us , we have a race to win . The ash-blond boy frowns , taking a moment to actually look at the two fuckers . The_man ($_berk) has the smallest of scars just beneath his ($_berk) lip , and a head of messy brown hair , two bits of which are braided . His ($_berk) eyes are a brilliant forest-green , incredibly different from his ($_berk) own hellish-looking red ones , and the lower half of his ($_berk) left leg is missing , replaced with a prosthetic that would ve made Mei fucking squeal with delight . The dragon is pure black , missing his ($_berk) left fin just like Striker ($_striker) , but his ($_berk) prosthetic is bright red instead of plain brown . 
 Striker ($_striker) ! he gasps , whirling around , but that s when he realizes the other weird thing about this dream-Berk : it s fucking empty . There are no heroes , no civilians ... there s just this eerie silence . 
  He ($_katsuki) whirls around , lunging forward and dealing out an explosion immediately . His ($_katsuki) target dodges , sidestepping easily as a black wing springs up like a shield . Katsuki ($_katsuki) recoils , tensing as a -LRB- n all-too fucking familiar -RRB- growl echoes . Striker ($_striker) ? he ($_katsuki) demands . 

($_aether)	In fact , they re all scarred . Not one of them is unmarked by the trials that he ($_the) has yet to face , but they re all smiling widely -LRB- even his ($_the) older self has managed a grin -RRB- . About time ! Ochako ($_ochako) calls with a laugh . Aether ($_aether) lets out a croaking snicker next to her ($_bakugou) , uncoiling into a sinuous copper beast . 
  She doesn t appear to notice him , instead grinning widely at Deku ($_deku) . Yeah, who would?? ?ve thought? she laughs . Her mask and helmet are gone as well , and shades of gold and pink decorate her face . She runs a hand over a copper-pink-orange-and-white mass , which opens violet eyes and purrs -- Aether ($_aether) , he realizes , Aether ($_aether) coiled up next to her . I m a little disappointed that no one s betting on us , personally . 

($_the)	The_older_Katsuki ($_the) opens his ($_the) mouth to retort , but the loud sound of a horn cuts him ($_the) off . Kirishima perks up as cheers start to ring out , floods of people and dragons passing by outside the glass doors , heading for what looks like some kind of open-air stadium . That s our cue ! the redhead shouts , breaking into a run . Race you to the arena !

($_shouto)	I ($_kirishima) think they need some help out there , Deku ($_deku) comments , peering through the glass doors with a bright smile . Shouto ($_shouto) seems to be losing ground against the onslaught of fans , and Fumikage and Mei just landed , so maybe we should send Kaminari or Yaoyorozu to head them off ? 
 You kidding ? Your betting pool is one of the largest out there , a new voice calls , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) -- and older , stronger Kirishima , face painted red and orange -- pads into view . Catalyst is out there distracting your adoring fans , along with Cryo and Shouto ($_shouto) .

 And trying to convert some diehard Uravity-and-Aether fans ? Ochako ($_ochako) teases . 
 Ochako ($_ochako) ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) squeaks -- yes , squeaks , because what the fuck she looks different -- and good , really good , but that s not the gods-damned point . 
 

($_yagi)	 And when the flames burnt out , he ($_yagi) was first to lunge forward , disappearing into a forest of ashes . Bakugou ($_bakugou) ! he ($_yagi) shouts , hacking up blood as his ($_yagi) muscle form begins to wither away . He ($_yagi) turns , coughing as the ash coats in lungs , chips of what feels like glass digging into his ($_yagi) flesh . It s nothing compared to the guilt deep within him ($_yagi) . He ($_yagi) dreads the sight of the burned and battered body , if it s even recognizable -LRB- he ($_yagi) fears that it won t be , that it ll be burned and blackened and mangled and utterly destroyed -RRB- , dreads bringing whatever remains there are back to Mitsuki before setting them out to sea , dreads the powerful Night Fury s grief . Yagi_Toshinori ($_yagi) stumbles through the ashes , gasping for breath as blood builds up behind his ($_yagi) teeth . He ($_yagi) remembers seeing young Bakugou plummet from the sky like Icarus , knocked from his ($_yagi) dragon by the tail of the beast , and he ($_yagi) remembers seeing Uraraka ($_uraraka) held back by young_Midoriya ($_midoriya) as she ($_uraraka) tried to run into the flames . He ($_yagi) remembers tears running down the faces of his ($_yagi) young students as they curl into each other , their dragons sheltering them and blocking them from the flames whenever they get too close . 
 He ($_yagi) sees the beast before his ($_yagi) thoughts can darken any further , and stiffens , before breaking into a run , smoke streaming off of his ($_yagi) body as his ($_yagi) muscle form dissipates . The Night Fury is curled up , wings half-splayed out . Its fake tailfin is twisted and bent , the leather burnt away and the metal ruined . Its saddle is half-destroyed too , frayed and burnt , and Bakugou ($_bakugou) is nowhere to be seen . 
 

($_bakugou)	In fact , they re all scarred .

($_kirishima)	At least Mr. Hero-Of-Berk has yet to appear , Kirishima ($_kirishima) laughs . 
 I ($_kirishima) think they need some help out there , Deku ($_deku) comments , peering through the glass doors with a bright smile . Shouto ($_shouto) seems to be losing ground against the onslaught of fans , and Fumikage and Mei just landed , so maybe we should send Kaminari or Yaoyorozu to head them off ? 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) looks offended . Course not ! It s not manly . 
 You kidding ? Your betting pool is one of the largest out there , a new voice calls , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) -- and older , stronger Kirishima , face painted red and orange -- pads into view . Catalyst is out there distracting your adoring fans , along with Cryo and Shouto ($_shouto) . Katsuki ($_katsuki) blinks at that , because first name basis , how the fuck did they end up on first name basis ? 
 

($_hiccup)	Hiccup ($_hiccup) nods and Toothless rubs against him ($_katsuki) gently . The resemblance to Striker is well , striking , and heartbreaking as well . Katsuki ($_katsuki) scowls . And ... I spoke to myself . 
 Hiccup ($_hiccup) tilts his ($_katsuki) head , before snorting with amusement . I suppose not . So , are you going back or not ? 
 You see , we have something they don t , Hiccup ($_hiccup) continues . They have armies , and they have armadas , but we have -- you have -- dragons . 
 

($_berk)	 Not quite , the voice chuckles , and the wing is pushed aside , revealing a snarling Night Fury and a smiling someone of about twenty . Down, Toothless. The dragon whines , looking remarkably like his ($_katsuki) Striker , and the_man ($_berk) rests a reassuring hand on its ($_berk) -- his ($_berk) -- head . It ($_berk) s okay , bud , he ($_katsuki) assures the Night Fury . It ($_berk) s just his ($_katsuki) natural reaction . He ($_katsuki) can t really hurt us anyway .

 Oh no , you re not dead , the_man ($_berk) says amicably . Not yet, anyway. Toothless and I , though , we re dead . Have been for years . The Night Fury croons and he ($_berk) reaches over and scratches the dragon s chin . 
 And the name clicks , finally . Toothless was the name of the Night Fury in his ($_berk) ancestor s notebook . 
 The_man ($_berk) tilts his ($_berk) head back and smiles . Yep . 
 His ($_katsuki) ancestor smiles . Well , if this soon-to-be reality version of Berk ($_berk) wasn t enough ... he ($_katsuki) hums , waving his ($_katsuki) hand . A misty room forms around them , eerily like the entrance hall in U.A. , but different -- there s more light , streaming through panes of colored glass . There are Terrible Terrors and other small dragons flying about , clinging to the rafters . 
 

($_deku)	Don t be so sure of your victory , Deku ($_deku) hums , and where the hell has this confidence come from ? You haven t won yet . 
 I ($_kirishima) think they need some help out there , Deku ($_deku) comments , peering through the glass doors with a bright smile . Shouto ($_shouto) seems to be losing ground against the onslaught of fans , and Fumikage and Mei just landed , so maybe we should send Kaminari or Yaoyorozu to head them off ?

 Are you ($_katsuki) kidding me ($_katsuki) ? It s definitely gon na be S -- oh my ($_katsuki) gods that s him ($_deku) ! the girl squeals , and her dragon s ruff flares as if to mimic her excitement as the doors open . 
 He ($_katsuki) snaps his ($_katsuki) fingers , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) leans forward as everything starts to move . Sound erupts in his ($_katsuki) ears , breathless laughter and dragon roars , yelps of annoyance from younger students that come running through , Nadders and Zipplebacks on their heels . A pair of older kids walk out into the sunshine , a Terror curled on the taller one s shoulder as a Hobblegrunt trails after her , an abnormally small Shockjaw padding behind the_shorter_boy_as_they ($_deku) chatter eagerly . The Dragon Riders are racing today ! the girl whispers as they pass the trio of Hiccup , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , and Toothless . The original seven , can you ($_katsuki) believe it ? Who are you ($_katsuki) betting on ?
