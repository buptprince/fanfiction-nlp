($_monoma)	The flabbergasted look on his ($_monoma) face was worth the unconventional greeting . You knew well enough that he ($_monoma) probably wouldn t recognize you since the last time you two had seen was before puberty had hit the both of you . Your father fell sick when you turned twelve and had insisted that you carry on the knight traditions in the family , only to ` miraculously ' bounce right back the day you were admitted to the academy . You knew it was all a rouse , but you did n't mind since becoming a knight was also your dream . 
 As for_Monoma ($_monoma) , he ($_monoma) was floored by the difference between the you he ($_monoma) used to know and the you currently in front of him ($_monoma) . So many pieces of the past were brought to the surface . He ($_monoma) thought he ($_monoma) was prepared to see you . Thought being the key word . 
  Yes. While we do our best to make sure that there isn t any division between men and women it s hard to get rid of it so quickly . She s probably gone through more discrimination and harsher training than her male counterparts . Ah , and you can meet her later today . I ($_monoma) ll send her a letter explaining the situation beforehand and then the two of you can sort out the details . Prince Monoma , huh ? It s been some time , you said as you read the letter your squire had handed you . Storing the letter in your boots , you told your squire to go and inform the_king ($_monoma) that you have received and read the message . 
 Monoma ($_monoma) had just finished dinner before he ($_monoma) was approached by a fully armored knight . They stood in front of him ($_monoma) without a word , waiting for him ($_monoma) to address them instead of vice versa , a situation all too strange for him ($_monoma) . He ($_monoma) was n't used to people walking up to him ($_monoma) without anything to say , hell , he ($_monoma) did n't think anyone would be . 
 What is your business ? he ($_monoma) asked cautiously , only to straighten up when the silent knight drew closer . S-State your name ! He ($_monoma) cursed himself ($_monoma) for his ($_monoma) nerves . 
 He ($_monoma) quickly picked up his ($_monoma) jaw from the floor and fixed his ($_monoma) posture , I-I - Oh wow . -LSB- F/N -RSB- ? I mean -LSB- L/N -RSB- ! I suppose I should be calling you that from now on 
 Your grin melted into a soft nostalgic smile , eyes no longer meeting his . Yes , I suppose that d be for the best too , Prince_Monoma ($_monoma) . You both knew that now you were both grown you could n't casually refer to each other anymore . Especially because it was no longer your place . 
 Mother , what do you mean the kingdom might fall ? Monoma ($_monoma) asked , having just walked into a private conversation between his ($_monoma) parents . 
 He ($_monoma) frowned . Everything is not going to be alright if we already have a doubt in our mind . What s going on , mother ? She kept her head down , refusing to even look at him ($_monoma) in fear that she would blurt out everything . Obviously not getting any answers from her , he ($_monoma) turned to his ($_monoma) father . 
 His ($_monoma) mother jerked around at the sound of his ($_monoma) voice , I-It s nothing sweetheart . Everything will be alright As the words came out of her mouth she couldn t bring herself to meet his ($_monoma) gaze . 
 I was hoping we would ve found an alternate method by now , but it looks like it s come to this , the_king ($_monoma) took a deep breath , Neito , our financial situation is looking dimmer and dimmer everyday . We ve tried to make trade changes and we ve even put up the new ores we mined on the market . Turns out the ores are worthless . We know this isn t what you wanted , but we need you to try and marry one of the princesses from Shiketsu . 
 W-WHAT - YOU WHAT !? Monoma ($_monoma) yelled , shell-shocked by the fact that his ($_monoma) parents , and more importantly his ($_monoma) father of all people , read his ($_monoma) journals . He ($_monoma) d mildly expected it of his ($_monoma) mother , but not his ($_monoma) father . 
 The_king ($_monoma) shook his ($_monoma) head . Neito ($_neito) , we have a permanent peace treaty between us and all the disputes are behind us . We need to move forward and show the kingdom that there is no resentment , and we really are in need of the financial support that would come from it . I know you want a marriage that comes from love rather than politics , especially after we read through your journals - 
 Speaking of travel , the_king ($_monoma) said , I ($_monoma) think it ($_monoma) d be best to leave the details to -LSB- L/N -RSB- -LSB- F/N -RSB- . She s one of the best knights we have , and the only one that s ever travelled to Shiketsu . 
 The_king ($_monoma) smiled . Ah , yes . You used to play with her when you were younger . There s no need to worry about her ability though . After the hell she s been through she s probably better than most of the men in her rank . 
 Monoma ($_monoma) was quick to study you while your eyes were averted . You had obviously matured as time went on , the air around you exuding strength and confidence . But while the air around you was the first thing he had noticed , the biggest change in his eyes was how much of a woman you had become . Just before he got lost in his thoughts you spoke up . 
 

($_neito)	The_king ($_monoma) shook his ($_monoma) head . Neito ($_neito) , we have a permanent peace treaty between us and all the disputes are behind us . We need to move forward and show the kingdom that there is no resentment , and we really are in need of the financial support that would come from it . I know you want a marriage that comes from love rather than politics , especially after we read through your journals - 
 Neito ($_neito) , the queen intervened , None of us want this for you . You know well that we would never force you into a political marriage if it had not come to this . 
 His father stepped forward , holding his son by each shoulder . I know this isn t easy for you , Neito ($_neito) . But thank you for choosing to do so . It d be best to leave as soon as possible .
