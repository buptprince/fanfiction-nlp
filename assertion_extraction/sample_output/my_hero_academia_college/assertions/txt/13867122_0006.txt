 Shoto ($_shoto) 
 Shoto ($_shoto) why didn t you ($_shoto) help us ? 
 Shoto ($_shoto) please ! 
 

($_damian)	I don t know what his ($_damian) real name is , but I 'm used to calling him ($_damian) Damian ($_damian) . I explain . She ($_bakugou) just nods , acknowledging my words . I can t help but to smile a little , maybe she ($_bakugou) 's getting over her ($_bakugou) fear of horses . I then remember the map and bring it to her ($_bakugou) . 
 He ($_damian) 's a strong horse . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and I nod in agreement . What do you call him ($_damian) ? 
 I blink few times before sighing in relief . I thank her ($_bakugou) as she ($_bakugou) carefully places her ($_bakugou) hand on Damian ($_damian) s head . Patting him ($_damian) awkwardly . 
  When we get to the town I realize I hadn t thought this through . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s clothing stuck out like a sore thumb . Her ($_bakugou) red cape especially was pretty eye catching not to mention her ($_bakugou) exotic look . I pull Damian ($_damian) along with us , I don t dare to leave him ($_damian) tied up anywhere . I take a hold of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulder and she ($_bakugou) looks up to me confused . I finally stop to catch my breath when we re in a good distance . Damian ($_damian) comes to snuffle my hair to see if I m alright , he ($_damian) doesn t seem to understand what was the matter . 
 He grunts and his friend tries to attack her ($_bakugou) now too . I drop the bag on the ground and tell Damian ($_damian) to stay put . 
 

($_i)	I_m ($_i) not calling you that . 
 Well since I_m ($_i) technically a king I m pretty sure we can call each other just with our names without titles right ? I say with a frown and she ($_bakugou) looks at me little pissed off . 
 

($_bakugou)	She ($_bakugou) s still waiting so I just get up and stretch a little bit . She ($_bakugou) sighs and stands up too . 
 We should get going , we need to go to the nearest town to get slightly more supplies since all we have were meant for one person only . Besides , after that it will take some time to reach the next town . I explain and Bakugou ($_bakugou) silently nods . She ($_bakugou) s being oddly quiet now , usually she ($_bakugou) s more aggressive . 
 I start to wonder if she ($_bakugou) s slightly worried of me after my nightmare . 
  My eyes open wide as I tear myself from the nightmare . I see confused look that shines from Bakugou ($_bakugou) s two red orbs as she ($_bakugou) s leaning over me . She ($_bakugou) must have tried to wake me up . I lift my hand to my forehead and sigh . Of course , it was just a dream . I must have fallen asleep at some point . She ($_bakugou) s still looking at me , waiting for an answer . I don t want to give her ($_bakugou) one . 
  You were dreaming . She ($_bakugou) says and I close my eyes for a bit before groaning loudly . She ($_bakugou) then pulls away from me as I sit up . She ($_bakugou) sits in front of me and for some reason she ($_bakugou) looks like a cute curious puppy , as strange as it sounds . A nightmare ? We get up on the horse and she ($_bakugou) seems still quite stiff but not as much as yesterday . 
 Evergarden ($_evergarden) was hidden just like my ($_evergarden) home was . Of course it s not marked in the maps directly . Bakugou ($_bakugou) explains to me with a bored expression . We can use this passage to get to Evergarden ($_evergarden) quickest . 
 I turn to look at the route I had noticed earlier on the map , she ($_bakugou) 's right . We don t have to waste time on longer routes that would usually take us through the northern side of the country . 
 I hear Bakugou ($_bakugou) call out to me as she ($_bakugou) gets on the horse and I decide to look through the map a little more later . 
 As we ride , I flinch when Bakugou ($_bakugou) leans against my chest . I look down and notice that she ($_bakugou) s in fact fallen asleep . 
 Normally I would ride fast as we can t waste time but I slow down now . Her ($_bakugou) breathing is steady and I 'm glad she ($_bakugou) 's feeling relaxed on horseback compared to when we first rode together . 
 I smile bit before looking at the map on her ($_bakugou) lap . I then realize something when I look closer , this path . 
 You are kidding . There s nothing but wasteland here . I say and she ($_bakugou) shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
 Deku ($_deku) was the only one who visits outside world . I never asked him ($_deku) what he ($_deku) was doing , just gave him ($_deku) the whistle to blow into in case he ($_deku) needed me . She ($_bakugou) explains . 
 Anyway , this money is outdated . No one uses spirit stones as currency anymore . I explain and she ($_bakugou) looks at the pretty vivid colored stones in her ($_bakugou) pouch . 
 I sigh and then give her ($_bakugou) her ($_bakugou) pouch back . 
 Deku ($_deku) never told you ? He ($_deku) uses gold . I ask and she ($_bakugou) then shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
 Huh . Well I never needed to go outside world since we could grow everything in my home . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and I chuckle at her ($_bakugou) cluelessness . It was cute in a way . 
 Whatever Half-and-half bastard . She ($_bakugou) then says . 
 So did you . I throw back to her ($_bakugou) and she ($_bakugou) then looks away with an irritated expression . 
 I don t know what his ($_damian) real name is , but I 'm used to calling him ($_damian) Damian ($_damian) . I explain . She ($_bakugou) just nods , acknowledging my words . I can t help but to smile a little , maybe she ($_bakugou) 's getting over her ($_bakugou) fear of horses . I then remember the map and bring it to her ($_bakugou) . 
 He ($_damian) 's a strong horse . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and I nod in agreement . What do you call him ($_damian) ? 
 The girl who is sitting next to me looks little surprised and I urge her ($_bakugou) to run already . She ($_bakugou) quickly whispers her ($_bakugou) thanks before making a break for it . 
 I then quickly get up on my feet and Bakugou ($_bakugou) prepares to fight when I grab her ($_bakugou) hand . 
 Her ($_bakugou) eyes widen a bit and then she ($_bakugou) turns away clicking her ($_bakugou) tongue . 
 Of course not . You are short-tempered for sure - I begin and she ($_bakugou) looks a little pissed off . - but you don t seem like the type of person to use your powers for evil . 
 I blink few times before sighing in relief . I thank her ($_bakugou) as she ($_bakugou) carefully places her ($_bakugou) hand on Damian ($_damian) s head . Patting him ($_damian) awkwardly . 
  How cheesy. She ($_bakugou) says and turns to Damian . I look at her ($_bakugou) confused as she ($_bakugou) walks over to the horse . But fine , whatever you say . I try not to use my powers unless it s an extreme emergency . There comes one spark right as I manage to grab her ($_bakugou) hand . She ($_bakugou) turns to me looking shocked and I m about to speak when I get a hard hit on my face from one of the thugs . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) dodges another hit and then strikes him with an uppercut . When he stumbles back she ($_bakugou) grins wildly . 
 She ($_bakugou) doesn t pull out her ($_bakugou) sword which I know is bad news . 
 She ($_bakugou) turns to me when I shout . I then notice all the people looking at us confused . 
 They re whispering , they must have seen that she ($_bakugou) was about to do something . That or they saw the first spark from her ($_bakugou) explosion power . 
 Half-and-half bastard !? She ($_bakugou) shouts and turns around . You ($_bakugou) little shit - 
 I don t know enough about magic to make that conclusion . I say and she ($_bakugou) shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
 That s not what I meant . Do you think I m a witch or evil ? She ($_bakugou) asks and I stare at her ($_bakugou) for a moment . 
 Right. So you ($_bakugou) do know that you ($_bakugou) can t use magic out in public ? 
 Why not? Why should I care ? She ($_bakugou) asks with a sour expression . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) , you ($_bakugou) do understand that the magic isn t exactly common anymore ? I ask . 
 Obviously , since my father put the well to sleep for hundreds of years . She ($_bakugou) says with arched brow . 
 Do you think that way ? She ($_bakugou) asks me and I turn to her ($_bakugou) surprised . 
 I take a deep breath , I then apologize and I half expect her ($_bakugou) to lash out on me . She ($_bakugou) doesn t , she ($_bakugou) stands there waiting for the explanation . 
  When we get to the town I realize I hadn t thought this through . Bakugou ($_bakugou) s clothing stuck out like a sore thumb . Her ($_bakugou) red cape especially was pretty eye catching not to mention her ($_bakugou) exotic look . I pull Damian ($_damian) along with us , I don t dare to leave him ($_damian) tied up anywhere . I take a hold of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s shoulder and she ($_bakugou) looks up to me confused . Good idea , we should be prepared since who knows how long it will be until we reach the next village . I say and she ($_bakugou) nods before turning around . 
 I looked at the Queen in front of me . She ($_bakugou) seemed to be in thought as well and all I could imagine was the conversation we had had the night before . 
 My mind wanders as we ride , she ($_bakugou) sometimes gives me directions but doesn t really speak . I m still thinking about the last night , the information given to me . 
 She ($_bakugou) looked surprisingly excited over spotting it and I can t help but to give a faint smile . 
  Hey look! She ($_bakugou) interrupts me right as I m about to speak . I then look to where she ($_bakugou) s pointing and see village nearby . She ($_bakugou) turns to me and grins . shouldn t we stop and get supplies for the journey right ? She ($_bakugou) refused to talk about it before and I didn t want to push her ($_bakugou) to talk more than she ($_bakugou) already had , but I just had so many questions . 
 I notice Bakugou ($_bakugou) looking at necklaces and that makes me think of the fact that she ($_bakugou) uses a lot . 
 More stares. I start to think it would have been better for make her ($_bakugou) stay and wait for a bit . 
 I then notice something , on the map it speaks of the hidden path between the mountains . One that usually travellers used , I need to ask Bakugou ($_bakugou) where on the map Evergarden should be . Maybe we could use this path and save us some time ! 
 Then what was !? She ($_bakugou) asks , throwing her ($_bakugou) hands around . 
 She ($_bakugou) turns to look at me surprised when I look at her ($_bakugou) with dead panned expression . 
 I pull her ($_bakugou) with me without warning and the three guys look surprised to see us run . They then start to shout after us , I do n't stay to listen . I grab my bag from the ground and whistle for Damian who begins to follow us . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouts curses to me but I don t have time to stay and listen . 
 Why the hell we ran !? She ($_bakugou) questions . We could have easily taken them on , or I could have at least . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) sounds a little out of breath too as her ($_bakugou) curses had quieted down . She ($_bakugou) then noticed that we re still holding hands and pulls her ($_bakugou) hand free . When I lift my eyes from the ground I realize how flushed her ($_bakugou) cheeks are . 
 She ($_bakugou) then suddenly points at the certain point on the map and my mouth fall open in surprise . 
 Do you think you can tell where the Evergarden used to be in this map ? I ask her ($_bakugou) and she ($_bakugou) leans in to see better . She ($_bakugou) studies it for a while , making me realize she ($_bakugou) might not have much idea of how much the world has changed since she ($_bakugou) was gone . 
 Well since I_m ($_i) technically a king I m pretty sure we can call each other just with our names without titles right ? I say with a frown and she ($_bakugou) looks at me little pissed off . 
 You lost your kingdom . She ($_bakugou) says , hands on her ($_bakugou) hips . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) - 
 I got money too you know ? I look at her ($_bakugou) and she ($_bakugou) then unwraps a small pouch on her ($_bakugou) hip . She ($_bakugou) gives it to me and I look inside it . I sigh and Bakugou ($_bakugou) tilts her ($_bakugou) head in confusion . 
 You haven t been out in human towns in a while , no one knows about dragon riders so you look little out of place . I explain and she ($_bakugou) then groans but nods . I think we should buy a map . 
 Are you implying I don t know where we re going ? She ($_bakugou) asks and I swear I m jumping from a mine to another . 
 Just , follow my lead for a bit . I say and she ($_bakugou) frowns . 
 Why the hell should I follow you around like a lost puppy ? She ($_bakugou) asks , expression sour . 
 Suddenly he brings up his fist and I almost drop the bag I m holding . I don t manage to do anything when she ($_bakugou) easily dodges and grabs the man s wrist . His friends look little shocked . 
 Want me to repeat to you ? I can see you re dumb but didn t expect you to be deaf as well ! Bakugou ($_bakugou) shouts hands on her ($_bakugou) hips . 
 He grunts and his friend tries to attack her ($_bakugou) now too . I drop the bag on the ground and tell Damian ($_damian) to stay put . 
 I see , you are deaf after all . Bakugou ($_bakugou) says and then proceeds to kick the man twice her ($_bakugou) size in his abdomen . 
 

($_deku)	Deku ($_deku) was the only one who visits outside world . I never asked him ($_deku) what he ($_deku) was doing , just gave him ($_deku) the whistle to blow into in case he ($_deku) needed me . She ($_bakugou) explains . 
 Deku ($_deku) never told you ? He ($_deku) uses gold . I ask and she ($_bakugou) then shakes her ($_bakugou) head . 
 

($_evergarden)	Evergarden ($_evergarden) was hidden just like my ($_evergarden) home was . Of course it s not marked in the maps directly . Bakugou ($_bakugou) explains to me with a bored expression . We can use this passage to get to Evergarden ($_evergarden) quickest .
