($_kaminari)	Off to the side , a prince looks over enviously , wishing he ($_kaminari) had what those two did . 
  Dude , that was so cool ! Kaminari ($_kaminari) s voice is more excited than ever , granted he s only known the guy for a few hours at most . Fuck , I was so worried when you literally ran off into the fire , but then you came back and parted the fire like a freakin wizard - I knew you were gon na get those_gauntlets ($_the) ! Me and Ashido were just talking about that before the challenge , and I was all for you getting them - . . Kaminari ($_kaminari) keeps talking for well over a minute , and Kirishima ($_kirishima) continues to listen even when he ($_kaminari) goes way off topic several times . He ($_kaminari) can t help but notice the way Kaminari s eyes have lit up when compared to before , and he ($_kaminari) thinks that maybe the bard needed something to cheer him ($_kaminari) up as opposed to the other way around . 
 Either way , he ($_kaminari) s really just glad he ($_kaminari) can help at all . 
 

($_tokoyami)	Hot is the first word that comes into Kirishima ($_kirishima) s mind as he ($_tokoyami) takes in his ($_tokoyami) surroundings . Him ($_tokoyami) and the others are in a word that seems to be made of caves , except the caves are burning and there s fire everywhere except for the small patch of unlit land that the ten of them are standing on . This is really a predicament , since there s no way to do anything - how will anyone even get the_Gauntlets ($_the) if they ($_the) can t leave the square without being burnt . 
  There s panic , but nothing as frantic as it was when they ($_the) were in the stormy sea . Other company members murmur quiet questions to eachother - he ($_mina) can hear Tokoyami ($_tokoyami) say something about how this environment doesn t set well with him ($_mina) , and Mina ($_mina) complaining about how hot it is . And , well , it is pretty hot . He ($_mina) s in a tank top , so he ($_mina) s more fine than some other people , Yaoyorozu has a lot of skin exposed , and next to him ($_mina) Bakugou is completely shirtless . He ($_mina) feels bad for Iida - in full armor - and Kaminari , because how many layers is that guy even wearing ? 

($_iida)	Even if this ($_mina) is a thing of being fair or not , this doesn t sit well with Kirishima ($_kirishima) . The thing is fast , faster than he ($_mina) d be even while sprinting , so if they all stay still for too long it ll be out of their sight in no time . And , Iida ($_iida) s screams of pain become louder with each second despite him ($_mina) moving further away . Before he ($_mina) even knows what he ($_mina) s doing , Kirishima ($_kirishima) s legs take him ($_mina) through the fire and towards the struggling Iida , though he ($_mina) s not closing the gap in distance . Still , as long as he ($_mina) keeps his ($_mina) pace up , he ($_mina) should be able to keep the thing in sight . 
 He ($_mina) s just thinking that everything seems too calm when the fire starts to rise until it takes the shape of a vaguely-human entity . Emphasis on vaguely , because , how close can a fire-thing really be to looking like a human ? Regardless of how human it looks , it acts almost robotic in taking hold of none other than Iida Tenya and dragging him ($_mina) away . He ($_mina) starts to wonder why , but then he ($_mina) remembers that Iida ($_iida) has water powers now and him ($_mina) being in the challenge would be totally unfair . 
 After minutes of running that feel like hours to him ($_mina) , he ($_mina) stumbles across what looks to be a temple that s mercifully been left unlit . As soon as he ($_mina) steps onto the red brick of the temple , the temperature drops so much that s actually kind of cold , and he ($_mina) spends a minute just making sure his ($_mina) feet aren t burnt.Then , of course , he ($_mina) remembers why he ($_mina) came here at all - Iida ($_iida) . 
 Iida ($_iida) s being fully restrained , but he ($_iida) curiously isn t catching fire . The fire is still probably very hot , though , if anything can be measured from the way Iida was screaming in pain earlier . He ($_iida) s quieter , now , but there are still hisses of pain that are loud enough for Kirishima ($_kirishima) to hear . 
 He ($_mina) sets forward into the temple , face contorting into a frown . He ($_mina) doesn t trust this place at all , but then again he ($_mina) doesn t really trust the tower as a whole , so he ($_mina) goes forward without hesitation through the double doors that take no effort at all to push open . There s certainly a sight waiting for him ($_mina) . There , in front of him ($_mina) , are the Gauntlets of the Fire Banquet , and he ($_mina) feels drawn to them like a moth to a flame . He ($_mina) thinks for a second on how ironic that metaphor is before noticing that behind the_gauntlets ($_the) is the fire person , and Iida ($_iida) . 
 It ($_kirishima) doesn t take long for the fire guard to notice him ($_iida) , and as soon as he ($_iida) does he ($_iida) grows a third hand from his ($_iida) stomach . Kirishima ($_kirishima) watches the hand raise up so much that it ($_kirishima) looks like it ($_kirishima) s going to envelop Iida ($_iida) s face and , oh , he ($_iida) realizes , that s exactly what it ($_kirishima) s doing . There s a moment where he ($_iida) looks at its ($_kirishima) lack of a face and a lot of things go through his ($_iida) head that aren t his ($_iida) own thoughts . 
 Walk out of here without them and let him ($_iida) die . That s what s best . 
 He ($_iida) snaps his ($_iida) head back up to Iida , who is dangerously close to getting his ($_iida) face burned off . Kirishima ($_kirishima) panics . He ($_iida) puts his ($_iida) arms out towards the fire and directs all he ($_iida) has into the thought of stopping the fire guard . He ($_iida) shuts his ($_iida) eyes . . 
 There isn t a moment of hesitation before he ($_iida) practically shoves his ($_iida) hands into the_red_gauntlets ($_the) . The insides of them are smooth and easy to slip into , and they shrink down to an exact fit as soon as they re on his ($_iida) hands . Maybe he ($_iida) is the one who s supposed to take the_gauntlets ($_the) , after all . Maybe he ($_iida) wouldn t have stepped away from the group if he ($_iida) wasn t. 
  You re okay ! Kirishima ($_kirishima) exclaims , mostly out of his ($_kirishima) prevailing shock , surprised to see Iida ($_iida) actually nod to confirm this . Well , that s perfect , cause the others are probably waiting for us back there . I might have ran off into the fire to come and get you , so they re probably worried . Iida ($_iida) looks very alarmed , but Kirishima ($_kirishima) is already walking out . . . and , miraculously , when he ($_iida) opens them he ($_iida) doesn t see the fire guard anywhere , and Iida ($_iida) is sighing in relief . Immediately , he ($_iida) runs towards Iida ($_iida) , thankful that he ($_iida) doesn t seem to be in pain anymore . 
  When they get to the fire again , panic erupts in his mind . How will they get back ? He s pretty tired from running so fast . Then he thinks , duh , remembering that he has the_Gauntlets ($_the) now . He does the thing that he just did and focuses all of his everything into making the fire part . It s just as surprising as it was before when it actually works , so he runs all the way back , glancing back every few seconds to make sure Iida ($_iida) is still following . 

($_the)	 Dude , that was so cool ! Kaminari ($_kaminari) s voice is more excited than ever , granted he s only known the guy for a few hours at most .

($_mina)	Kirishima ($_kirishima) s not really the smartest person , but even he ($_mina) has the sense to try and look for any way to progress at all from this point , but from what he ($_mina) can see there s nothing to do if he ($_mina) wants to remain un-barbequed . The caves seem to stretch out forever , with very little dry patches .
