($_katsuki)	If you do n't stop yammering in my ear , I 'm going to smother you with a pillow , Katsuki ($_katsuki) warns , sending Izuku ($_izuku) into a fit of giggles that shakes them both . I am trying to bask in the afterglow here , you fucking nerd , he ($_katsuki) complains as he ($_katsuki) rolls over , and Izuku ($_izuku) follows him ($_katsuki) instinctively , tucking his ($_katsuki) face back in the crook of Katsuki ($_katsuki) s neck . 
 So I guess that 's why you did n't want me touching your wings , he ($_izuku) murmurs into Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) sweat-drenched skin . It makes sense , really , that they 'd be so sensitive since they probably never get casual touch . Are they hard to clean ? Can I clean them for you ? They 're so soft on the underside , I did n't exp - 
 Izuku wails out wordlessly , lower body bucking up into his ($_izuku) hold , hand digging hard enough to draw blood from the skin of his ($_izuku) lower back while his ($_izuku) other hand twists into Katsuki ($_katsuki) s hair . He ($_izuku) s moving mindlessly , eyes locked on Katsuki ($_katsuki) s as he ($_izuku) comes hard , vision whiting out around the edges . Katsuki ($_katsuki) bellows , the motions of his ($_izuku) hand frenetic as he ($_izuku) follows Izuku ($_izuku) over the edge , body collapsing on top of the other as he ($_izuku) pants . The song decrescendos , softens to a soothing lullaby as Izuku ($_izuku) kisses the crook of Katsuki ($_katsuki) s neck sleepily . 
 At the ragged sound of his ($_izuku) name coming from his ($_izuku) mate - the song confirms what Katsuki ($_katsuki) had suspected the first time he ($_izuku) laid eyes on the freckled explorer - Katsuki ($_katsuki) quickens his ($_izuku) movements , using the combined liquid of their precum to slick his ($_izuku) hand , to prevent that uncomfortable drag as he ($_izuku) squeezes his ($_izuku) fingers tighter . 
 Izuku shivers as the song solidifies , feels the_dragon ($_the) - no , Katsuki - do the same and he ($_izuku) increases the frantic pace of his ($_izuku) thrusts . Katsuki ($_katsuki) reaches down with the arm not clutching desperately at Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulders to grip both of them , to drag his ($_izuku) fingers down their lengths . He ($_izuku) s just gasping heavily against the dragon s lips , the green of his ($_izuku) eyes nearly eclipsed by his ($_izuku) desire as he ($_izuku) tries to collect enough air to choke out , Ka-Katsuki - 
 Nah , I found what I was looking for , and he begins to hum , the vibrations reverberating through Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) skin . Besides , I feel like you could quench all of my thirsts - 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) groans , sinking his ($_katsuki) fingers into Izuku 's wild green curls and tugging him ($_katsuki) up so that he ($_katsuki) can shut him ($_katsuki) up properly . 
 I looked everywhere for you , he ($_katsuki) says , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) curls his ($_katsuki) arm around his ($_katsuki) waist . You 're not going to get rid of me so easily now . 
 

($_izuku)	And then the dragon moves , faster than Izuku ($_izuku) can blink , and in less than one beat of his ($_izuku) heart , Izuku ($_izuku) is pinned to the ground by the_dragon ($_the) s human form . His ($_izuku) sharp features are twisted into a beautifully flushed snarl as his ($_izuku) hands cage around Izuku ($_izuku) s wrists , effectively holding him ($_izuku) still . One leg is planted firmly between his ($_izuku) own , straddling his ($_izuku) thigh , and he ($_izuku) s drowning in the heat rising from the_dragon_s_body ($_the) . 
 Are are you ($_izuku) proud of that ? 
 I 'm amazed it ($_the) only took you ($_izuku) a few hours to realize that . Usually it ($_the) takes people a bit longer ! 
 You ($_izuku) 're a fucking weirdo , the_dragon ($_the) says , and the sound rumbles beneath Izuku_'s ($_'s) cheek . 
 The_dragon ($_the) dumps him ($_izuku) unceremoniously onto the bed , snickering at Izuku ($_izuku) s surprised oof ! 
  That looks so comfy !! And it ($_izuku) s so big !  Is this where you ($_izuku) sleep in your ($_izuku) dragon form ? Are you ($_izuku) going to be sleeping in your ($_izuku) dragon form tonight ? Do I get to sleep in here with you ($_izuku) ? Can I see your ($_izuku) wings this time ? Izuku ($_izuku) only opens his ($_izuku) eyes again when they ($_izuku) come to a stop . There s a massive pile of blankets before them ($_izuku) , mounds upon mounds of silky-looking blankets and plump pillows . He ($_izuku) lifts his ($_izuku) head , staring at them ($_izuku) in awe as he ($_izuku) grins . 
 The_dragon ($_the) falls silent , not answering . Izuku ($_izuku) is calmed by his ($_izuku) purposeful stride , rocked back and forth against his ($_izuku) chest with those arms tight around him ($_izuku) , and he ($_izuku) does n't quite fall asleep but he ($_izuku) does close his ($_izuku) eyes . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) blinks , observing him ($_izuku) dubiously . Yeah , I don t think so . You ($_izuku) look far too uptight to eat in your ($_izuku) bed . 
 You ($_izuku) re entirely too trusting . Maybe I just brought you ($_izuku) here to eat you ($_izuku) ? 
 Do not move , the_dragon ($_the) warns , and Izuku ($_izuku) feels it - the_dragon ($_the) s length , hard and heavy and smearing moisture on the warm skin of his ($_izuku) thigh . His ($_izuku) breath catches in his ($_izuku) throat , held hostage by the searing heat of the_dragon ($_the) s gaze as he ($_izuku) attempts to cool his ($_izuku) ardor . But Izuku ($_izuku) doesn t want him ($_izuku) to calm down , Izuku ($_izuku) wants nothing more than to discover how the song will sound in the background of their coupling . 
 Maybe I like being the damsel , Izuku ($_izuku) slurs , brain fried from the torture . And sides , I m the virgin sacrifice here . 
 You are a god , only a god can look like that , he ($_izuku) mumbles and the being lets out a surprised chuckle that is immediately covered by another growl . He ($_izuku) continues working on untying the knots , with little success . Izuku ($_izuku) can hear the frustration rising in his ($_izuku) wordless grumbles . 
 If those fucking idiots don t stop littering on my mountain , I really will raze the whole village to the ground , the god hisses as he ($_izuku) gives up on unknotting the rope . There s a tearing sound and then his ($_izuku) body slumps forward , his ($_izuku) legs unable to bear his ($_izuku) weight . Strong arms wrap around him ($_izuku) , one curling around his ($_izuku) waist to sturdy him ($_izuku) . 
 But m not trash , Izuku ($_izuku) protests weakly , clinging to the being . I m a person . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) lets that pout twist his ($_izuku) lips again , and the_dragon ($_the) shakes his ($_izuku) head , not even waiting to hear what the green-haired man has to say . Izuku ($_izuku) says it ($_the) anyways . 
  Izuku ($_izuku) drifts , for the most part . He ($_midoriya) has a song , part of one - a song that he ($_midoriya) s sure he ($_midoriya) s never heard aloud but he ($_midoriya) knows it still - that he ($_midoriya) can t help but to hum when he ($_midoriya) s in dangerous situations like this . You have amazing control , you did n't even nick me , he tells the_dragon ($_the) seriously , and he opens his jaw wider so that he can pull back . Izuku ($_izuku) pats his ($_izuku) snout , unconcerned with the fact that the_dragon ($_the) could probably gulp him ($_izuku) down in one swallow . I ll be gentle too ! 
 I m so sorry , he ($_izuku) tells him ($_izuku) , the words overly empathetic and yet dripping with sincerity . That should never have happened to your ancestors . You shouldn t have to live with that kind of burden hanging over you , he ($_izuku) slides his ($_izuku) hands up to the dragon s shoulders and then yanks , pulling him ($_izuku) into a tight hug as the dragon squawks and flails . 
 The dragon stills at his ($_izuku) wailed words , freezing as their truth seeps past his ($_izuku) fury-built barriers . Izuku ($_izuku) clutches at his ($_izuku) broad shoulders as he ($_izuku) cries , overcome with the gut-wrenching sensation of second-hand pain , and the_dragon ($_the) lets him ($_izuku) . In fact , he ($_izuku) pats awkwardly at his ($_izuku) head , shushing him ($_izuku) in a sort of bewildered haze . 
  The_dragon ($_the) rushes him ($_izuku) from the spring down another hall , the very second they dry off . He ($_izuku) keeps one hand caged around Izuku 's wrist , as if worried that he ($_izuku) 'll get lost in the winding tunnels , and he ($_izuku) probably would if he ($_izuku) was alone . He ($_izuku) 's tired from crying , still exhausted from the ordeal before , and he ($_izuku) sways as they walk . He ($_izuku) lists closer to the dragon to leech off some of his ($_izuku) warmth , because the only garment he ($_izuku) has on is a deep red towel tied around his ($_izuku) waist . By the time they make it to their next destination , Izuku ($_izuku) is snuggled up beneath his ($_izuku) arm and the_dragon ($_the) still seems too bewildered to protest . C'mon , ca n't you ($_izuku) move any faster ? 
 No , Izuku ($_izuku) mumbles , rubbing his ($_izuku) cheek against the_dragon_'s ($_the) side . The spring made me sleepy . 
 I 'm trying to get you ($_izuku) to a bed , the_dragon ($_the) snaps . Then you ($_izuku) can sleep to your ($_izuku) heart 's content . 
 The joy drains from Izuku ($_izuku) s face and he ($_izuku) leans backwards , to better see the dragon s face . The lines of his ($_izuku) face are hard , stony , unwavering in its intensity as he ($_izuku) glares towards the wall . He ($_izuku) can feel the angry dance of his ($_izuku) heartbeat beneath his ($_izuku) fingers - he ($_izuku) s never going to miss an opportunity to spread his ($_izuku) hands over those muscles , never - and Izuku ($_izuku) pats gently . 
 You 're just so amazing , Izuku ($_izuku) breathes out , the look on his ($_izuku) face one of pure awe . The light flush on the god s cheeks bursts into a wildfire , one that roars down his ($_izuku) neck to his ($_izuku) bare collarbones . 
  Those ruby eyes stare down at him ($_izuku) , considering , and Izuku ($_izuku) smiles up at him ($_izuku) . The dragon hunkers close to the ground and Izuku ($_izuku) squeals before clambering up his ($_izuku) leg . He ($_izuku) pauses with his ($_izuku) hand hovering over one furled wing and the dragon sighs , shaking it and stretching it out fully . Izuku gasps at the sheer beauty of the wing , at the strength hidden in those joints and leathery skin . His ($_izuku) fingers glide over each clawed wingtip , paying no mind to how the wing flutters with each caress , and then he ($_izuku) strokes his ($_izuku) fingers upon the inner webbing , where he ($_izuku) finds the skin to be delicately soft . If you do n't stop yammering in my ear , I 'm going to smother you with a pillow , Katsuki ($_katsuki) warns , sending Izuku ($_izuku) into a fit of giggles that shakes them both . I am trying to bask in the afterglow here , you fucking nerd , he ($_katsuki) complains as he ($_katsuki) rolls over , and Izuku ($_izuku) follows him ($_katsuki) instinctively , tucking his ($_katsuki) face back in the crook of Katsuki ($_katsuki) s neck . 
 So I guess that 's why you did n't want me touching your wings , he ($_izuku) murmurs into Katsuki_'s ($_katsuki) sweat-drenched skin . It makes sense , really , that they 'd be so sensitive since they probably never get casual touch . Are they hard to clean ? Can I clean them for you ? They 're so soft on the underside , I did n't exp - 
 He ($_izuku) cuts himself ($_izuku) off , those eyes widening even more . The other holds his ($_izuku) gaze as the thought unfolds in his ($_izuku) mind . And then he ($_izuku) squeaks , the shrill sound reverberating throughout the_cavern ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) jumps to his ($_izuku) feet , clapping his ($_izuku) hands . 
 I told you ($_izuku) I 'm always like this , Izuku ($_izuku) pouts up at him ($_izuku) , droplets beading off of his ($_izuku) green hair and slipping down onto his ($_izuku) skin . And then , the words truly sink in and his ($_izuku) green eyes grow wide . It 's a healing spring ?! I thought only the dra - 
 He ($_izuku) cups his ($_izuku) hands and dips them into the water , bringing them up to study the water pooled there . His ($_izuku) nose nearly touches the liquid , his ($_izuku) face is so close to it , and the other claps a hand to the back of his ($_izuku) head , sending him ($_izuku) down beneath the surface . 
 I do n't know , I just assumed you ($_izuku) wanted a soak ! Are there other properties to the water ? 
 I wanted to make sure you ($_izuku) got your ($_izuku) brain too , he ($_izuku) sneers . The water has healing properties . 
 He ($_izuku) comes back up sputtering , W-what was that for ?! 
 He places both hands on Izuku ($_izuku) s face , one on each cheek , and leans down - he has to actually bend , Izuku ($_izuku) has never lamented his ($_izuku) short stature more in his ($_izuku) life - to seal their mouths together . As far as shutting the_green-haired_explorer ($_izuku) up , it works wonders but then , Izuku ($_izuku) slides his ($_izuku) own hands up . He ($_izuku) lets them settle over the other s large hands , cupping them more firmly to his ($_izuku) face so that he ($_izuku) can t jerk away when he ($_izuku) eagerly returns the kiss . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes widen and his ($_izuku) arms windmill out in wide circles as he ($_izuku) tries not to fall backwards on his ($_izuku) butt . The god sighs again , reaching out to yank at one of his arms until he steadies himself . 
 It s not really lava . It s an illusion , he says , as if that should explain everything and put a stop to the massive amount of questions about to explode from Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth . 
 You do n't even think I 'm human . You actually know for a fact that I 'm not , he ($_'s) points out and Izuku ($_izuku) shrugs . 
 That 's never stopped me before ! he ($_'s) proclaims enthusiastically . The blonde 's nose scrunches - whether it 's in distaste or anger , Izuku ($_izuku) does n't know but it is cute . So very cute. 
 But the other is much stronger than Izuku ($_izuku) , and it takes him ($_izuku) little effort to detangle their hands and pull away . To Izuku_'s ($_'s) mounting pleasure , the other is panting - face still flushed and his ($_'s) lids hooded as he ($_'s) stares down at him ($_'s) . Izuku ($_izuku) feels as if he ($_'s) s drowning in magma , in that deep crimson gaze . Izuku ($_izuku) pointedly does n't glance down , no matter how badly he ($_'s) wants to see if that blush travels all the way down . 
 If that 's how you plan to keep shutting me up , I 'm going to keep talking , Izuku ($_izuku) tells him ($_'s) breathlessly , ignoring his ($_'s) own arousal , his ($_'s) hands pressed to the heat of his ($_'s) own cheeks . 
 Izuku wails out wordlessly , lower body bucking up into his ($_izuku) hold , hand digging hard enough to draw blood from the skin of his ($_izuku) lower back while his ($_izuku) other hand twists into Katsuki ($_katsuki) s hair . He ($_izuku) s moving mindlessly , eyes locked on Katsuki ($_katsuki) s as he ($_izuku) comes hard , vision whiting out around the edges . Katsuki ($_katsuki) bellows , the motions of his ($_izuku) hand frenetic as he ($_izuku) follows Izuku ($_izuku) over the edge , body collapsing on top of the other as he ($_izuku) pants . The song decrescendos , softens to a soothing lullaby as Izuku ($_izuku) kisses the crook of Katsuki ($_katsuki) s neck sleepily . 
 It 's the call that you feel , my little one , she tells him ($_midoriya) , her smile tinged with a concern that he ($_midoriya) s too young to understand . You 're so very lucky , Izuku ($_izuku) ! The universe has gifted you with someone who will complement you perfectly , someone who 's weaknesses and strengths will balance your own . One day ($_day) , you will find them and everything will seem so much better . The world will be brighter , a little warmer , a little more colorful . 
 You ($_izuku) 're like a freaking puppy , do you ($_izuku) ever chill ? Do n't you ($_izuku) want to know why I brought you ($_izuku) to this spring ? 
 Izuku ($_izuku) knows it 's bait for a subject change but he ($_izuku) absolutely takes it , his ($_izuku) eyes lighting up . 
 The other is seemingly ignoring him but the tips of his ears are red . They stop outside a massive hole , one that 's clearly meant to act as a doorway , and then the other leads the way inside . Izuku ($_izuku) freezes just inside , overwhelmed by the beauty of the_cavern ($_izuku) . 
 The room is steaming , heat rising over a pool of water that springs up from deep in the earth . There are shards of crystals - quartz and diamonds and maybe others , clearly jammed into the cavern walls at specific intervals - so that when the other shifts the torch , the room shimmers with tiny stars . It 's breathtaking , and for a second , Izuku ($_izuku) can only gape . 
 Will you ($_izuku) tell me your ($_izuku) name ? 
 When the other slides down into the water , Izuku ($_izuku) follows with little hesitation . It 's true that he ($_izuku) has far too much curiosity but he ($_izuku) also has very good instincts . It 's a gift from his ($_izuku) his_father_'s ($_izuku) line , and it lets him ($_izuku) sink down beside the other - too close for the other 's comfort , if the way he ($_izuku) shifts is anything to go by - without feeling any hint of danger or regret . He ($_izuku) smiles up at him ($_izuku) , and the other actually squints at the force of his ($_izuku) blinding grin . 
 Well? Izuku ($_izuku) prompts and the other scowls . 
 There s no reason to put up with this bullying , Izuku ($_izuku) . This has gone on too far , I m going to go to Toshinori . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) sets his ($_izuku) mouth mulishly , refusing to answer for fear of recriminating the other children . His ($_izuku) mother sighs heavily , the air of her breath rustling his ($_izuku) hair . 
 At the ragged sound of his ($_izuku) name coming from his ($_izuku) mate - the song confirms what Katsuki ($_katsuki) had suspected the first time he ($_izuku) laid eyes on the freckled explorer - Katsuki ($_katsuki) quickens his ($_izuku) movements , using the combined liquid of their precum to slick his ($_izuku) hand , to prevent that uncomfortable drag as he ($_izuku) squeezes his ($_izuku) fingers tighter . 
 Thank the sun , I ($_i) didn t think you were ever going to shut up , the being says as he pulls back . Unconsciously , Izuku ($_izuku) chases him , desperate to have those lips against his own again . They feel good , the taste unlike anything he s ever enjoyed before . Shit , you really don t have any self-preservation , do you ? Were you always like this , or did the sun scramble your senses ? 
 I ($_i) think I ($_i) ll stick with Deku ($_deku) , it seems more fitting , the god ignores his questions as he shoves him away and rolls to his feet , and holy mother of darkness , that height difference . Izuku ($_izuku) pouts , staggering to his ($_izuku) feet and following the tall being as he ($_izuku) strolls away . He ($_izuku) s as bare as a newborn babe , completely naked and seemingly uncaring of the fact . 
 You can call me Deku if you tell me your name , he ($_izuku) wheedles , unobservant of his ($_izuku) own nakedness . And the fact that he ($_izuku) d just been cuddled up to this magnificent snack - no , scratch that . This_man ($_izuku) is a feast - without a stitch of clothing between either of them ? Well , that thought hasn t caught up to him ($_izuku) yet , either . 
 Izuku shivers as the song solidifies , feels the_dragon ($_the) - no , Katsuki - do the same and he ($_izuku) increases the frantic pace of his ($_izuku) thrusts . Katsuki ($_katsuki) reaches down with the arm not clutching desperately at Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulders to grip both of them , to drag his ($_izuku) fingers down their lengths . He ($_izuku) s just gasping heavily against the dragon s lips , the green of his ($_izuku) eyes nearly eclipsed by his ($_izuku) desire as he ($_izuku) tries to collect enough air to choke out , Ka-Katsuki - 
 Izuku , he ($_izuku) agrees , the sound muffled in their kiss . My name s Katsuki , he ($_izuku) pants . 
 Deku , the_dragon ($_the) groans , the sound nearly swallowed by the needy noises escaping from Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) twines his ($_izuku) arms around the_dragon ($_the) s back , the fingers of one hand digging into his ($_izuku) lower back and his ($_izuku) other hand sinking into the tendrils of hair at the nape of the_dragon ($_the) s neck . He ($_izuku) uses his ($_izuku) new leverage to angle his ($_izuku) lower half , so that their cocks brush together with each downward thrust of the_dragon ($_the) s body . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) mewls at the sudden pressure , where the_dragon ($_the) s abdomen settles heavy on his ($_izuku) cock , and he ($_izuku) rocks up , tilting his ($_izuku) hips to grant himself ($_izuku) some delicious friction . The dragon bites at his ($_izuku) lower lip , dipping his ($_izuku) tongue into the cavern of Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth when his ($_izuku) lips part open on a strangled moan . He ($_izuku) swirls the muscle , making Izuku ($_izuku) quake beneath him ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) attempts to kiss back with as much fervor as he ($_izuku) s being gifted . The song swells in the back of his ($_izuku) mind , intensifying drastically . Izuku ($_izuku) whimpers into the_dragon ($_the) s kiss and the_dragon ($_the) growls , rutting down onto his ($_izuku) thigh . 
 All of this because the village 's crops had withered in their fields . He ($_midoriya) 'd tried to explain that crops need more water in times of intense heat , that irrigation is a thing , that no vengeful god had seared the life from their crops but no , suddenly he ($_midoriya) s a witch and it s his ($_midoriya) fault that they re too stubborn to believe him ($_midoriya) . And that whole virgin thing ? Seriously? Why do gods always want virgins ? And why does everyone think that witches are bad ? Arguing that had damn near caused the village head to faint but well , Izuku ($_izuku) has never once backed down from a fight as long as it s in defense of someone else , someone who can t defend themselves . 
 The_dragon ($_the) snaps out and that giant maw closes gently over his wrist , and he looks in amazement at the teeth brushing his skin . The_dragon ($_the) holds his jaw carefully so that his teeth do n't scrape and Izuku ($_izuku) finds himself sufficiently distracted as he inspects the_dragon_'s ($_the) snout and wide mouth . 
 And yet here you are , kissing me back , and you do n't even know my name , he mocks and Izuku ($_izuku) laughs again . 
 The_dragon ($_the) s face hardens , and he ($_izuku) begins to pull back . Izuku ($_izuku) panics at the loss of the delicious heat that surrounds him ($_izuku) and rolls his ($_izuku) hips up , dragging his ($_izuku) own aching cock against the_dragon ($_the) s thigh . Those red eyes shutter closed as he ($_izuku) tries to regain his ($_izuku) composure , panting heavy over Izuku ($_izuku) . 
 Please? Izuku ($_izuku) whines , breathless as he ($_izuku) rolls his ($_izuku) hips again . He ($_izuku) keeps his ($_izuku) eyes open , barely wide enough to see the second the_dragon ($_the) gives in . He ($_izuku) sinks down , releasing Izuku ($_izuku) s wrists to shove one arm behind his ($_izuku) neck , propping him ($_izuku) up halfway so that he ($_izuku) can press their chests together when he ($_izuku) drops his ($_izuku) mouth savagely to Izuku ($_izuku) s. 
 My soulmate will be my life partner , the green-haired boy says , with all the confidence that being a teenager ensures . Inko giggles as she finishes stitched the pack , shaking it out for Izuku ($_izuku) to inspect it . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) smiles at her , tapping his ($_izuku) fist against his ($_izuku) heart . I just know it . I can feel the truth of it in my soul . 
 It s already spelled against fire and filth , it should resist common wear and tear . It s just , I don t want you to get your hopes up , Izuku ($_izuku) . How sure are you that your soulmate will also be your life partner ? 
  You keep asking me questions and then telling me to shut up , make up your mind , Izuku ($_izuku) laughs , darting after the other when he ($_izuku) strides away . Which is it ? And it 's not like I slept my way through a ton of random Others ! I grew up in a domain , so I knew everyone for a while first , not that there were that many . Not that that should matter either . At the deep growl , Izuku ($_izuku) pries his ($_izuku) eyes open , blinking them slowly to try to draw some moisture back to the dehydrated organs . His ($_izuku) vision is filled with a myriad of reds and deep oranges , and he ($_izuku) squeaks as he ($_izuku) blinks more furiously , trying to clear the color from his ($_izuku) eyes . Another deep growl shakes the ground at his ($_izuku) feet and Izuku ($_izuku) stops breathing . Not because he ($_izuku) s scared . No , there s something that he ($_izuku) s missing . Something important that can t cut through the pain of the burns along his ($_izuku) skin , the lethargy fogging his ($_izuku) brain . 
 Oh , shitshitshit - he ($_izuku) inhales , stumbling over the words . Those villagers were right , he ($_izuku) croaks out , air scraping through the arid desert of his ($_izuku) throat . 
 The voice sounds even more irritated now , and the creature leans in close , intense heat blowing over his ($_izuku) face . He ($_izuku) wilts , his ($_izuku) body is already too tired from ricocheting between hot and cold , beneath the force of that heat and surprisingly , it fades instantly . Something tugs at his ($_izuku) wrists and he ($_izuku) can t hold back the agonized shriek as the rope rips his ($_izuku) wounds back open . The being curses and the movements gentle , a caress instead of forceful tugging . 
  Good , that means the illusions are working , the_dragon ($_the) hisses , and Izuku ($_izuku) slips on the wet stone beneath his ($_izuku) feet . The_dragon ($_the) catches him ($_izuku) , the movement flawlessly effortless , once again pulling Izuku ($_izuku) to his ($_izuku) chest . Izuku ($_izuku) s finger s itch with the urge to explore his ($_izuku) skin . And there aren t , not really . We re all half-bloods , or less . The Ancients couldn t adapt , couldn t hide . So , no matter how fierce or strong they were , they were all hunted down and killed , or worse . This way , we can at least hide in plain sight . Just in case the illusions do fail . Ohmygosh ! You ($_izuku) 're a dragon ?!! That 's even more amazing ! Eeeeeeee !!! I ca n't believe this , you ($_izuku) 're so awesome ! I thought there weren t any more dragons ! 
 He s watching him the whole time that he s talking so he sees the exact second that the_dragon ($_the) realizes what he s talking about , that dawning realization that he knows because he hears it too . And then that gorgeous face shutters closed , a wall slams down , and he rolls over , so that he can t see the pout that Izuku ($_izuku) instantly throws at him . 
 Fucking fine , the_dragon ($_the) grumbles as he scoots back , close enough that Izuku ($_izuku) can tuck his face against him . But go the fuck to sleep . We ll talk about the rest in the morning . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) lays down , curls against the_dragon ($_the) s bare back . He jerks , starting to pull away but Izuku ($_izuku) whines out , I m so cold ! 
 Izuku ($_izuku) knows he ($_izuku) can feel his ($_izuku) smile by the heavy sigh the_dragon ($_the) heaves but he ($_izuku) relaxes completely , letting Izuku ($_izuku) snuggle into him ($_izuku) . 
 There 's light coming from somewhere - Izuku ($_izuku) ca n't locate it and does n't truly care - and it reflects off of those brilliant scales , scattering in the air in a burst of deep reds and dark oranges . The_dragon ($_the) is curled around him ($_izuku) like a sleeping cat , tail tucked loosely around Izuku_'s ($_'s) bare body - the towel having come loose in the_night ($_the) - and his ($_izuku) wings flutter with every deep inhalation . His ($_izuku) dragon form is massive and yet , he ($_izuku) looks so small and adorable like this . 
 He ($_izuku) wakes to rumbling snores - deep and loud enough that his ($_izuku) body rises and falls with each one - and he ($_izuku) sits up to find the_dragon ($_the) has shifted sometime during the_night ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) runs his ($_izuku) fingers carefully over the carmine and amber scales ... He ($_izuku) is just so glorious . 
 The_dragon ($_the) blinks , the purring halting as that huge eyelid slides open to reveal a ruby eye glaring directly at Izuku ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) growls , the vibration shaking the green haired man so that he ($_izuku) almost falls but Izuku ($_izuku) smiles innocently and scratches again . The eyelid closes as he ($_izuku) purrs again , only to shake himself ($_izuku) and swipe out with his ($_izuku) tail . Izuku crashes forward , his ($_izuku) fall cushioned by a massive leg . 
  Izuku ($_izuku) fights the suddenly desperate urge to squeal , stomps it down hard , in favor of rolling quietly to his ($_izuku) knees so that he ($_izuku) can stretch up . He ($_izuku) still ca n't quite manage so he ($_izuku) shuffles forward , taking care to move slowly , and then he ($_izuku) climbs up onto the_dragon_'s ($_the) tail . He ($_izuku) 's still too short but he ($_izuku) can just barely reach , can just barely touch behind one of the_dragon_'s ($_the) ears , so that he ($_izuku) can scratch gently . The skin there is soft as butter , uncovered by scales , and he ($_izuku) keeps his ($_izuku) touch soft . The_dragon ($_the) purrs , he ($_izuku) actually purrs , and Izuku ($_izuku) ca n't hold back the adoring coo . Finally , Izuku ($_izuku) opens his ($_izuku) eyes - though he ($_izuku) has to blink several times to clear the blur from them . The god inhales sharply , quickly turning the surprised sound into another warning growl but Izuku ($_izuku) is n't afraid . He 's surprisingly calm - especially since it feels as if his heart is trying to beat free from his ribcage . 
 Oh. It 's his ($_izuku) savior from before . And he ($_izuku) can sound angry all he ($_izuku) wants but upon shifting to human form , he ($_izuku) 'd curled his ($_izuku) arms around Izuku ($_izuku) . As if he ($_izuku) craves the touch almost instinctively . 
 Shhhh , he ($_izuku) whispers , patting the massive tail soothingly , and the being shifts with a snarl , his ($_izuku) pillow shrinking rapidly until he ($_izuku) 's curved around warm , naked skin . 
 But mama ! I m never alone ! he taps his ($_izuku) head , as if to remind her ($_inko) . The song is always here ! 
  There 's something heavy - hot and wet - dragging over his ($_izuku) wrists , first one and then the other , but surprisingly , there 's no pain . There 's something even heavier draped over his ($_izuku) waist , and the tapered end of it thumps almost lazily at the ground beneath him ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) 's warm but not too warm , and the savage pain of his ($_izuku) ravaged skin is barely an ache , though even that is fading . There s a melody twisting in his ($_izuku) mind , the song whole and complete for the first time that he ($_izuku) can recall . Izuku ($_izuku) releases a content moan , sliding his ($_izuku) hands along whatever is settled on his ($_izuku) stomach and curling into it . It feels smooth , deceptively so because when he ($_izuku) runs his ($_izuku) fingers along the surface , he ($_izuku) nicks a finger . It 's just a tiny pinprick of pain but there 's an annoyed hiss from his ($_izuku) pillow .  No ! He ($_izuku) pushes against her , panic welling in his ($_izuku) green eyes as he ($_izuku) meets her worried gaze again .  They just don t understand ! Th-they look at me , and they see all the humans who hurt them , and their parents , and their ancestors . They they just see something t-to fear . If I were to fight back , that ll j-just make them think they re right ! his ($_izuku) speech ends on a tremulous wail and Inko ($_inko) clutches him ($_izuku) tightly to her ($_inko) chest . Oh , Izuku ($_izuku) , baby . Changing the world is such a big burden for such a tiny set of shoulders . And violence is never the answer , not with children , she ($_inko) hugs him ($_izuku) too close , squeezing him ($_izuku) as she ($_inko) hides her ($_inko) tears in his ($_izuku) hair . I don t want you wandering alone anymore . 
 Eh ? You ($_izuku) re a faery ? 
 The_dragon ($_the) plops down beside him , sitting with his legs sprawled wide and his hands stretched behind him to prop him up . He stares at Izuku ($_izuku) curiously , waiting for an answer . 
 You ($_izuku) shouldn t trust a creature that you ($_izuku) ve just met ! And I just brought you ($_izuku) to my den , both of us naked and all you ($_izuku) have to say is , Can I see your ($_izuku) wings ? What the hell ? How have you ($_izuku) even survived this long ? 
 He swats at Izuku s questing fingers , knocking them away from his hair before collapsing back on the bed . Izuku ($_izuku) follows him down , propping his face on his palm so that he can study the_dragon ($_the) s face . They ($_izuku) re quiet for a minute , Izuku ($_izuku) cataloguing every bit of the_dragon ($_the) s face and the dragon staring back at him searchingly . 
 The sound of his ($_izuku) exclamation echoes , bounces off of the stone , and the god - man ? Eh , who even knows - turns with a weary sigh , his ($_izuku) arms crossed over his ($_izuku) chest . How downright blasphemous. He ($_izuku) s distracted until the other being snarls , patience dwindling by the second . 
  Izuku ($_izuku) does shut up but only so he ($_izuku) can observe their surroundings . The walls are smooth stone , shining in the flickering light of torches spaced evenly along the walls . The ground is also smooth stone , and the hall is more of a tunnel , really . Except it s huge , absolutely massive . He ($_izuku) slows to a stop so that he ($_izuku) can crane his ($_izuku) neck back , to see all the way to the ceiling . The being tilts his ($_izuku) head , glancing upwards and then shrugs . Yeah , we re inside the volcano , underneath the magma . 
 

($_'s)	You ($_izuku) 're a fucking weirdo , the_dragon ($_the) says , and the sound rumbles beneath Izuku_'s ($_'s) cheek . 
 The_dragon ($_the) pauses , considering , and then dips , curling an arm under Izuku_'s ($_'s) knees and another around his ($_'s) back , before swooping him ($_'s) up , cradling him ($_'s) to his ($_'s) chest . Izuku_'s ($_'s) mind is n't clouded by pain this time , so when he ($_'s) presses his ($_'s) face to the_dragon_'s ($_the) chest , he ($_'s) can fully enjoy the smooth slide of skin against skin . 
 He ($_'s) reaches up again and the man - god ? - closes his ($_'s) fingers around his ($_'s) wrists . Now it 's Izuku 's turn to gasp , to inhale sharply , to stare up at him ($_'s) in awe as his ($_'s) skin heats beneath the other 's grip . 
  The man is devastatingly gorgeous . It all makes Izuku_'s ($_'s) heart throb and his ($_'s) stomach burn : the harsh cut of his ($_'s) jaw , the chiseled features of his ($_'s) face , the burning flames of his ($_'s) ruby eyes , the fierce mess of his ($_'s) pale blonde hair . Not to mention that the man 's - the god 's ? - body bulges with muscles that sculpt every single inch of him ($_'s) into an image of divinity . And he ($_'s) can t help it , he ($_'s) really , really can t - he ($_'s) reaches up , curls his ($_'s) fingers over those glorious pecs and squeezes . The god dumps him ($_'s) to the smooth stone of the floor immediately but there s a blush burning across those cheekbones . You do n't even think I 'm human . You actually know for a fact that I 'm not , he ($_'s) points out and Izuku ($_izuku) shrugs . 
 That 's never stopped me before ! he ($_'s) proclaims enthusiastically . The blonde 's nose scrunches - whether it 's in distaste or anger , Izuku ($_izuku) does n't know but it is cute . So very cute. 
 But the other is much stronger than Izuku ($_izuku) , and it takes him ($_izuku) little effort to detangle their hands and pull away . To Izuku_'s ($_'s) mounting pleasure , the other is panting - face still flushed and his ($_'s) lids hooded as he ($_'s) stares down at him ($_'s) . Izuku ($_izuku) feels as if he ($_'s) s drowning in magma , in that deep crimson gaze . Izuku ($_izuku) pointedly does n't glance down , no matter how badly he ($_'s) wants to see if that blush travels all the way down . 
 If that 's how you plan to keep shutting me up , I 'm going to keep talking , Izuku ($_izuku) tells him ($_'s) breathlessly , ignoring his ($_'s) own arousal , his ($_'s) hands pressed to the heat of his ($_'s) own cheeks . 
 There 's light coming from somewhere - Izuku ($_izuku) ca n't locate it and does n't truly care - and it reflects off of those brilliant scales , scattering in the air in a burst of deep reds and dark oranges . The_dragon ($_the) is curled around him ($_izuku) like a sleeping cat , tail tucked loosely around Izuku_'s ($_'s) bare body - the towel having come loose in the_night ($_the) - and his ($_izuku) wings flutter with every deep inhalation . His ($_izuku) dragon form is massive and yet , he ($_izuku) looks so small and adorable like this . 
 

($_the)	And then the dragon moves , faster than Izuku ($_izuku) can blink , and in less than one beat of his ($_izuku) heart , Izuku ($_izuku) is pinned to the ground by the_dragon ($_the) s human form . His ($_izuku) sharp features are twisted into a beautifully flushed snarl as his ($_izuku) hands cage around Izuku ($_izuku) s wrists , effectively holding him ($_izuku) still . One leg is planted firmly between his ($_izuku) own , straddling his ($_izuku) thigh , and he ($_izuku) s drowning in the heat rising from the_dragon_s_body ($_the) . 
 I 'm amazed it ($_the) only took you ($_izuku) a few hours to realize that . Usually it ($_the) takes people a bit longer ! 
 You ($_izuku) 're a fucking weirdo , the_dragon ($_the) says , and the sound rumbles beneath Izuku_'s ($_'s) cheek . 
 The_dragon ($_the) dumps him ($_izuku) unceremoniously onto the bed , snickering at Izuku ($_izuku) s surprised oof ! 
 The_dragon ($_the) falls silent , not answering . Izuku ($_izuku) is calmed by his ($_izuku) purposeful stride , rocked back and forth against his ($_izuku) chest with those arms tight around him ($_izuku) , and he ($_izuku) does n't quite fall asleep but he ($_izuku) does close his ($_izuku) eyes . 
 Do not move , the_dragon ($_the) warns , and Izuku ($_izuku) feels it - the_dragon ($_the) s length , hard and heavy and smearing moisture on the warm skin of his ($_izuku) thigh . His ($_izuku) breath catches in his ($_izuku) throat , held hostage by the searing heat of the_dragon ($_the) s gaze as he ($_izuku) attempts to cool his ($_izuku) ardor . But Izuku ($_izuku) doesn t want him ($_izuku) to calm down , Izuku ($_izuku) wants nothing more than to discover how the song will sound in the background of their coupling . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) lets that pout twist his ($_izuku) lips again , and the_dragon ($_the) shakes his ($_izuku) head , not even waiting to hear what the green-haired man has to say . Izuku ($_izuku) says it ($_the) anyways . 
 You have amazing control , you did n't even nick me , he tells the_dragon ($_the) seriously , and he opens his jaw wider so that he can pull back . Izuku ($_izuku) pats his ($_izuku) snout , unconcerned with the fact that the_dragon ($_the) could probably gulp him ($_izuku) down in one swallow . I ll be gentle too ! 
 The dragon stills at his ($_izuku) wailed words , freezing as their truth seeps past his ($_izuku) fury-built barriers . Izuku ($_izuku) clutches at his ($_izuku) broad shoulders as he ($_izuku) cries , overcome with the gut-wrenching sensation of second-hand pain , and the_dragon ($_the) lets him ($_izuku) . In fact , he ($_izuku) pats awkwardly at his ($_izuku) head , shushing him ($_izuku) in a sort of bewildered haze . 
  The_dragon ($_the) rushes him ($_izuku) from the spring down another hall , the very second they dry off . He ($_izuku) keeps one hand caged around Izuku 's wrist , as if worried that he ($_izuku) 'll get lost in the winding tunnels , and he ($_izuku) probably would if he ($_izuku) was alone . He ($_izuku) 's tired from crying , still exhausted from the ordeal before , and he ($_izuku) sways as they walk . He ($_izuku) lists closer to the dragon to leech off some of his ($_izuku) warmth , because the only garment he ($_izuku) has on is a deep red towel tied around his ($_izuku) waist . By the time they make it to their next destination , Izuku ($_izuku) is snuggled up beneath his ($_izuku) arm and the_dragon ($_the) still seems too bewildered to protest . No , Izuku ($_izuku) mumbles , rubbing his ($_izuku) cheek against the_dragon_'s ($_the) side . The spring made me sleepy . 
 I 'm trying to get you ($_izuku) to a bed , the_dragon ($_the) snaps . Then you ($_izuku) can sleep to your ($_izuku) heart 's content . 
 The_dragon ($_the) pauses , considering , and then dips , curling an arm under Izuku_'s ($_'s) knees and another around his ($_'s) back , before swooping him ($_'s) up , cradling him ($_'s) to his ($_'s) chest . Izuku_'s ($_'s) mind is n't clouded by pain this time , so when he ($_'s) presses his ($_'s) face to the_dragon_'s ($_the) chest , he ($_'s) can fully enjoy the smooth slide of skin against skin . 
 Oh , Izuku_,_the_green_haired_woman ($_the) holds her ($_the) arms out and the young boy slumps into her ($_the) comforting hold , resting his head beneath her ($_the) chin . What happened , baby ? 
 Izuku shivers as the song solidifies , feels the_dragon ($_the) - no , Katsuki - do the same and he ($_izuku) increases the frantic pace of his ($_izuku) thrusts . Katsuki ($_katsuki) reaches down with the arm not clutching desperately at Izuku ($_izuku) s shoulders to grip both of them , to drag his ($_izuku) fingers down their lengths . He ($_izuku) s just gasping heavily against the dragon s lips , the green of his ($_izuku) eyes nearly eclipsed by his ($_izuku) desire as he ($_izuku) tries to collect enough air to choke out , Ka-Katsuki - 
 Deku , the_dragon ($_the) groans , the sound nearly swallowed by the needy noises escaping from Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) twines his ($_izuku) arms around the_dragon ($_the) s back , the fingers of one hand digging into his ($_izuku) lower back and his ($_izuku) other hand sinking into the tendrils of hair at the nape of the_dragon ($_the) s neck . He ($_izuku) uses his ($_izuku) new leverage to angle his ($_izuku) lower half , so that their cocks brush together with each downward thrust of the_dragon ($_the) s body . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) mewls at the sudden pressure , where the_dragon ($_the) s abdomen settles heavy on his ($_izuku) cock , and he ($_izuku) rocks up , tilting his ($_izuku) hips to grant himself ($_izuku) some delicious friction . The dragon bites at his ($_izuku) lower lip , dipping his ($_izuku) tongue into the cavern of Izuku ($_izuku) s mouth when his ($_izuku) lips part open on a strangled moan . He ($_izuku) swirls the muscle , making Izuku ($_izuku) quake beneath him ($_izuku) as he ($_izuku) attempts to kiss back with as much fervor as he ($_izuku) s being gifted . The song swells in the back of his ($_izuku) mind , intensifying drastically . Izuku ($_izuku) whimpers into the_dragon ($_the) s kiss and the_dragon ($_the) growls , rutting down onto his ($_izuku) thigh . 
 The_dragon ($_the) snaps out and that giant maw closes gently over his wrist , and he looks in amazement at the teeth brushing his skin . The_dragon ($_the) holds his jaw carefully so that his teeth do n't scrape and Izuku ($_izuku) finds himself sufficiently distracted as he inspects the_dragon_'s ($_the) snout and wide mouth . 
 The_dragon ($_the) s face hardens , and he ($_izuku) begins to pull back . Izuku ($_izuku) panics at the loss of the delicious heat that surrounds him ($_izuku) and rolls his ($_izuku) hips up , dragging his ($_izuku) own aching cock against the_dragon ($_the) s thigh . Those red eyes shutter closed as he ($_izuku) tries to regain his ($_izuku) composure , panting heavy over Izuku ($_izuku) . 
 Please? Izuku ($_izuku) whines , breathless as he ($_izuku) rolls his ($_izuku) hips again . He ($_izuku) keeps his ($_izuku) eyes open , barely wide enough to see the second the_dragon ($_the) gives in . He ($_izuku) sinks down , releasing Izuku ($_izuku) s wrists to shove one arm behind his ($_izuku) neck , propping him ($_izuku) up halfway so that he ($_izuku) can press their chests together when he ($_izuku) drops his ($_izuku) mouth savagely to Izuku ($_izuku) s. 
  Good , that means the illusions are working , the_dragon ($_the) hisses , and Izuku ($_izuku) slips on the wet stone beneath his ($_izuku) feet . The_dragon ($_the) catches him ($_izuku) , the movement flawlessly effortless , once again pulling Izuku ($_izuku) to his ($_izuku) chest . Izuku ($_izuku) s finger s itch with the urge to explore his ($_izuku) skin . And there aren t , not really . We re all half-bloods , or less . The Ancients couldn t adapt , couldn t hide . So , no matter how fierce or strong they were , they were all hunted down and killed , or worse . This way , we can at least hide in plain sight . Just in case the illusions do fail . He s watching him the whole time that he s talking so he sees the exact second that the_dragon ($_the) realizes what he s talking about , that dawning realization that he knows because he hears it too . And then that gorgeous face shutters closed , a wall slams down , and he rolls over , so that he can t see the pout that Izuku ($_izuku) instantly throws at him . 
 Fucking fine , the_dragon ($_the) grumbles as he scoots back , close enough that Izuku ($_izuku) can tuck his face against him . But go the fuck to sleep . We ll talk about the rest in the morning . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) lays down , curls against the_dragon ($_the) s bare back . He jerks , starting to pull away but Izuku ($_izuku) whines out , I m so cold ! 
 Izuku ($_izuku) knows he ($_izuku) can feel his ($_izuku) smile by the heavy sigh the_dragon ($_the) heaves but he ($_izuku) relaxes completely , letting Izuku ($_izuku) snuggle into him ($_izuku) . 
 There 's light coming from somewhere - Izuku ($_izuku) ca n't locate it and does n't truly care - and it reflects off of those brilliant scales , scattering in the air in a burst of deep reds and dark oranges . The_dragon ($_the) is curled around him ($_izuku) like a sleeping cat , tail tucked loosely around Izuku_'s ($_'s) bare body - the towel having come loose in the_night ($_the) - and his ($_izuku) wings flutter with every deep inhalation . His ($_izuku) dragon form is massive and yet , he ($_izuku) looks so small and adorable like this . 
 He ($_izuku) wakes to rumbling snores - deep and loud enough that his ($_izuku) body rises and falls with each one - and he ($_izuku) sits up to find the_dragon ($_the) has shifted sometime during the_night ($_the) . Izuku ($_izuku) runs his ($_izuku) fingers carefully over the carmine and amber scales ... He ($_izuku) is just so glorious . 
 The_dragon ($_the) blinks , the purring halting as that huge eyelid slides open to reveal a ruby eye glaring directly at Izuku ($_izuku) . He ($_izuku) growls , the vibration shaking the green haired man so that he ($_izuku) almost falls but Izuku ($_izuku) smiles innocently and scratches again . The eyelid closes as he ($_izuku) purrs again , only to shake himself ($_izuku) and swipe out with his ($_izuku) tail . Izuku crashes forward , his ($_izuku) fall cushioned by a massive leg . 
  Izuku ($_izuku) fights the suddenly desperate urge to squeal , stomps it down hard , in favor of rolling quietly to his ($_izuku) knees so that he ($_izuku) can stretch up . He ($_izuku) still ca n't quite manage so he ($_izuku) shuffles forward , taking care to move slowly , and then he ($_izuku) climbs up onto the_dragon_'s ($_the) tail . He ($_izuku) 's still too short but he ($_izuku) can just barely reach , can just barely touch behind one of the_dragon_'s ($_the) ears , so that he ($_izuku) can scratch gently . The skin there is soft as butter , uncovered by scales , and he ($_izuku) keeps his ($_izuku) touch soft . The_dragon ($_the) purrs , he ($_izuku) actually purrs , and Izuku ($_izuku) ca n't hold back the adoring coo .  Wha , no ! I m just Izuku , he smiles brilliantly , reaching out to tug at the blonde strands of the_dragon ($_the) s hair , running his fingers through it ($_the) and then scratching gently at his scalp .  The_dragon ($_the) melts into the touch , tipping closer to Izuku . I can do magic , pretty well . Just a handful of elemental things but I can do all sorts of spells ! And my instincts are almost always right . My luck is pretty good , too !  My dad s descended from the_Fae_,_the_royal_line ($_the) , I guess ? He didn t stick around very long so that s like , the one thing I don t have a ton of research on . The_Fae ($_the) are actually really hard to find . Faeries don t like to talk much about them . The_dragon ($_the) plops down beside him , sitting with his legs sprawled wide and his hands stretched behind him to prop him up . He stares at Izuku ($_izuku) curiously , waiting for an answer . 
 A shit ton of luck , probably ! he replies cheerfully , his hands sinking down into a mound of pillows to squeeze and poke at them . Also my dad s line is descended from the_Fae ($_the) . That probably has a bit to do with it . 
 He swats at Izuku s questing fingers , knocking them away from his hair before collapsing back on the bed . Izuku ($_izuku) follows him down , propping his face on his palm so that he can study the_dragon ($_the) s face . They ($_izuku) re quiet for a minute , Izuku ($_izuku) cataloguing every bit of the_dragon ($_the) s face and the dragon staring back at him searchingly . 
  It feels like like hmmm , he pauses , keeping his emerald eyes glued on the_dragon ($_the) s face . 

($_midoriya)	 Izuku ($_izuku) drifts , for the most part . He ($_midoriya) has a song , part of one - a song that he ($_midoriya) s sure he ($_midoriya) s never heard aloud but he ($_midoriya) knows it still - that he ($_midoriya) can t help but to hum when he ($_midoriya) s in dangerous situations like this .  It happens far more than he ($_midoriya) wants to admit to but this time , the song - usually so hard to hear , so distorted - feels so much clearer than ever before . It sounds so soothing . And there s not really anything else to do . He ($_midoriya) d tried screaming for help . He ($_midoriya) d tried to loosen the ropes from his ($_midoriya) wrists but all he ($_midoriya) d managed to do was rub the skin , ripping it until the rope is soaked with his ($_midoriya) blood , dripping down the pole onto the ground where it sizzles . The soles of his ($_midoriya) bare feet are burned , the ground too hot to tolerate for such a long period of time , so even if he ($_midoriya) did manage to free himself ($_midoriya) , he ($_midoriya) wouldn t be able to run . He ($_midoriya) s not really one to give up but well , there s not much he ($_midoriya) can do so he ($_midoriya) hums the song . But does it have to call so loudly ? he ($_midoriya) whimpers as he ($_midoriya) claps his ($_midoriya) hands over his ($_midoriya) ears , to muffle the song that only he ($_midoriya) can hear . 
  So now , here he ($_midoriya) is . Boiling in his ($_midoriya) own skin from the heat visibly rolling from the volcano . He ($_midoriya) s pretty sure that the wooden poles have started to smoke faintly , at the point where they re buried in the soil . The sun is drifting lazily towards the horizon and the night slinks closer . He ($_midoriya) s not worried about animals coming to bother him ($_midoriya) once the light fades , though he ($_midoriya) probably should be .  No , he ($_midoriya) s more worried about the fierce ache that stretches along each inch of his ($_midoriya) exposed skin , which has been burned a deep and viciously dark red . The wind feels frigid as it brushes his ($_midoriya) skin , sending tremors wracking through him ($_midoriya) , and the rapid switch from the devastating heat to the gentle chill is a shock to his ($_midoriya) body . Especially with the heat still churning behind him ($_midoriya) , within the volcano . One would think that the heat would warm him ($_midoriya) from the cold but it s too much , too many extremes . It 's the call that you feel , my little one , she tells him ($_midoriya) , her smile tinged with a concern that he ($_midoriya) s too young to understand . You 're so very lucky , Izuku ($_izuku) ! The universe has gifted you with someone who will complement you perfectly , someone who 's weaknesses and strengths will balance your own . One day ($_day) , you will find them and everything will seem so much better . The world will be brighter , a little warmer , a little more colorful . 
 Nope! Midoriya ($_midoriya) s always keep their green hair ! 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) , huh ? 
 Yup , Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) but you can call me Izuku ! What s your name ? 
 All of this because the village 's crops had withered in their fields . He ($_midoriya) 'd tried to explain that crops need more water in times of intense heat , that irrigation is a thing , that no vengeful god had seared the life from their crops but no , suddenly he ($_midoriya) s a witch and it s his ($_midoriya) fault that they re too stubborn to believe him ($_midoriya) . And that whole virgin thing ? Seriously? Why do gods always want virgins ? And why does everyone think that witches are bad ? Arguing that had damn near caused the village head to faint but well , Izuku ($_izuku) has never once backed down from a fight as long as it s in defense of someone else , someone who can t defend themselves . 
 Mama , it hurts again , the little boy tucks himself ($_midoriya) into the woman 's arms , tiny fists clutching the fabric over his ($_midoriya) chest . She smooths her hand over his ($_midoriya) green hair , the repetitive motion calming to him ($_midoriya) . 
 Strung between two wooden poles - his ($_midoriya) wrists tied painfully tight so that he ($_midoriya) ca n't slump forward to take the weight off of his ($_midoriya) legs - Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) ca n't help but seriously regret everything he ($_midoriya) 's ever done in his ($_midoriya) life that 's led to this moment . Not that he ($_midoriya) 's ever done anything bad but still . Maybe that 's his ($_midoriya) problem . Maybe if he ($_midoriya) could have just kept riding past the village , so clearly in need of saving that he ($_midoriya) could n't not stop , he ($_midoriya) would n't be in this mess right now . Tied up , wearing only thin white trousers - he ($_midoriya) 'd talked them out of the robe , thank fuck - and spread out like some feast on the rim of a volcano waiting for some god that may or may not exist to come devour him ($_midoriya) . 
  Night falls truly , the dark deepening around him ($_midoriya) until his ($_midoriya) dry eyes can t see through the shadows . He ($_midoriya) s both cold and hot , his ($_midoriya) body shivering violently . At one point , he ($_midoriya) vomits - bile splashing down his ($_midoriya) front . By the time the moon rises high above him ($_midoriya) , just a tiny sliver of light , there s a light rain misting down on him ($_midoriya) .  It feels wonderful on his ($_midoriya) sun-ravaged skin but the chill overtakes him ($_midoriya) , then . At least it washes most of the bile from his ($_midoriya) skin . When his ($_midoriya) body stops shaking despite the lingering chill , he ($_midoriya) s sure he ($_midoriya) won t make it until sunrise , with his ($_midoriya) mind wavering beneath the strain of his ($_midoriya) predicament . But he ($_midoriya) keeps humming until he ($_midoriya) finally loses consciousness . 

($_i)	 Are you the god that the village tried to sacrifice me ($_i) to ? I ($_i) tried to explain irrigation to them but they were so certain that there was a vengeful god drying up their crops ! They said you were a great beast but you just look unfairly hot to me ($_i) . Hehe ($_hehe) , is that it ($_hehe) ? They still have all of my ($_i) journals . I ($_i) hope they did n't try to burn them , I ($_i) 'm not sure the magic would hold up to direct flames . There s so much information , I ($_i) d hate to lose all of it or let it get in the wrong hands . I ($_i) mean , I ($_i) spelled it so that only I ($_i) could see what s on the pages but I ($_i) m sure there are ways around tha - 
 Thank the sun , I ($_i) didn t think you were ever going to shut up , the being says as he pulls back . Unconsciously , Izuku ($_izuku) chases him , desperate to have those lips against his own again . They feel good , the taste unlike anything he s ever enjoyed before . Shit , you really don t have any self-preservation , do you ? Were you always like this , or did the sun scramble your senses ? 
 Pretty much always been like this , yeah . My ($_i) mother curses my ($_i) curious nature just as often as she encourages it . She says that some curiosity is good but that I ($_i) - aha - I ($_i) take it too far ! 
 I ($_i) bet every hair on her head is gray , thanks to you . 
 I ($_i) think I ($_i) ll stick with Deku ($_deku) , it seems more fitting , the god ignores his questions as he shoves him away and rolls to his feet , and holy mother of darkness , that height difference . Izuku ($_izuku) pouts , staggering to his ($_izuku) feet and following the tall being as he ($_izuku) strolls away . He ($_izuku) s as bare as a newborn babe , completely naked and seemingly uncaring of the fact . 
 

($_day)	It 's the call that you feel , my little one , she tells him ($_midoriya) , her smile tinged with a concern that he ($_midoriya) s too young to understand . You 're so very lucky , Izuku ($_izuku) ! The universe has gifted you with someone who will complement you perfectly , someone who 's weaknesses and strengths will balance your own . One day ($_day) , you will find them and everything will seem so much better . The world will be brighter , a little warmer , a little more colorful . 
 And you ll always be there for them . One day ($_day) , when you re big and strong , you can even go search for them ! 
 

($_hehe)	 Are you the god that the village tried to sacrifice me ($_i) to ? I ($_i) tried to explain irrigation to them but they were so certain that there was a vengeful god drying up their crops ! They said you were a great beast but you just look unfairly hot to me ($_i) . Hehe ($_hehe) , is that it ($_hehe) ? 

($_inko)	But mama ! I m never alone ! he taps his ($_izuku) head , as if to remind her ($_inko) . The song is always here ! 
  They just don t understand ! Th-they look at me , and they see all the humans who hurt them , and their parents , and their ancestors . They they just see something t-to fear . If I were to fight back , that ll j-just make them think they re right ! his ($_izuku) speech ends on a tremulous wail and Inko ($_inko) clutches him ($_izuku) tightly to her ($_inko) chest . Oh , Izuku ($_izuku) , baby . Changing the world is such a big burden for such a tiny set of shoulders . And violence is never the answer , not with children , she ($_inko) hugs him ($_izuku) too close , squeezing him ($_izuku) as she ($_inko) hides her ($_inko) tears in his ($_izuku) hair . I don t want you wandering alone anymore . 
 

($_deku)	I ($_i) think I ($_i) ll stick with Deku ($_deku) , it seems more fitting , the god ignores his questions as he shoves him away and rolls to his feet , and holy mother of darkness , that height difference . Izuku ($_izuku) pouts , staggering to his ($_izuku) feet and following the tall being as he ($_izuku) strolls away . He ($_izuku) s as bare as a newborn babe , completely naked and seemingly uncaring of the fact . 
 What now , Deku ($_deku) ?
