($_midoriya)	 Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled wide , amused . Yes. Really , Baba_Yaga ($_baba) and Witch of the Forest are just titles that have been passed from person to person . I think the old witch who loves to eat kids is the second or the third holder . Maybe the fourth . I m currently the ninth .  Um. Todoroki . Shouto ($_shouto) blinked at the slightly shorter boy Midoriya ($_midoriya) . I_m ($_i) sorry , but I don t think I heard you correctly . You re Baba_Yaga ($_baba) ? The boy laughed , almost bashfully . Yeah , uh , I know I don t look the part . But really , Baba_Yaga ($_baba) or Witch of the Forest is just a title . Call me Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
  It wasn t._Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled bright enough to rival the sun and said , Then call me Izuku ($_izuku) . The smile wobbled . His ($_midoriya) mouth opened and ran off before he ($_midoriya) thought , and before Shouto ($_shouto) could stop himself ($_midoriya) he ($_midoriya) blurted , Shouto ($_shouto) . 
 There was silence for a moment before Midoriya ($_midoriya) broke it . It s been nice , Todoroki ($_todoroki) . I wish you ($_don) a safe travel . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) blinked . Sorry ? 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) beamed , and warmth that had nothing to do with the torch in his ($_midoriya) hands or his ($_midoriya) own flame magic spread in Shouto ($_shouto) s chest . Anyway , just so you know . Once its purpose is filled , the fire will return here . Don ($_don) t be surprised if it suddenly flies away . 
 That s good , Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled , fidgets finally stilling . I would give the light for free if I could , honestly . But it doesn t work that way . 
 I hope the task I gave you wasn t too hard ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) asked , fidgeting in his ($_midoriya) seat . I would ve given you an easier task , but my torches are very precious to me . It would need to be given out at a high price . 
  Midoriya ($_midoriya) lowered his ($_midoriya) arms . Well , you ve done your part , he ($_midoriya) said , smiling . He ($_midoriya) looked less flustered , though pink tint still colored his ($_midoriya) cheeks . It s my turn to uphold my end of the bargain .  He ($_midoriya) stood up and motioned Shouto ($_shouto) to follow before going out of the hut . He ($_midoriya) pointed at the burning torches . Go. Take the golden one . You ve earned it . Shouto ($_shouto) nodded and went forward , taking the torch off the ground . It slid off the seemingly rock hard earth as easily as an oversized ring off a buttered finger . He ($_midoriya) gripped the sturdy wood and turned to meet Midoriya ($_midoriya) s gleaming green eyes . Thank you . 
  A blush spread across Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , and Shouto ($_shouto) was suddenly overcome with how cute he ($_shouto) looked . Well, um. I just want to help people , any way that I could . Midoriya ($_midoriya) wrapped his ($_midoriya) arms around his ($_midoriya) own neck , as if trying to hug himself ($_midoriya) and hide his ($_midoriya) face at the same time . Still , I can t give out everything for free . Midoriya ($_midoriya) beamed at him and beckoned him to follow as he went back to the hut . Come with me . 
 The door creaked closed on its own the moment Shouto ($_shouto) was inside , and he found himself staring straight into Midoriya ($_midoriya) s grinning eyes . 
  Midoriya ($_midoriya) tilted his ($_midoriya) head . Light ? As in fire ? Don ($_don) t you have fire magic within you ? I can sense it , you know . Fire and ice . Midoriya ($_midoriya) hummed . Well , I suppose I can give you light , but there s a price to be paid . I can t just give anything for free to anyone . It doesn t work that way . 
  Well , Midoriya ($_midoriya) glanced to the door . I have a delivery to make , you see , and there are a lot to do . If you can sort my grain , clean the poppy seeds , and cook my meal before I return on the morrow , you can take your light . Otherwise I ll have to take something of yours instead . He looked at Shouto ($_shouto) expectantly . Would you do it ? That was a good meal , Midoriya ($_midoriya) said once he ($_midoriya) finished his ($_midoriya) food . I haven t eaten something that good in a while . Thank you , Todoroki ($_todoroki) . 
 By the time the inky black night sky begun to turn into cool blue , Shouto ($_shouto) and the dolls had finished the tasks Midoriya ($_midoriya) had asked . Shouto ($_shouto) had returned the husks back into the outermost husk and was in the middle of cleaning the area when the door creaked open . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) walked in , sniffing the air with a dreamy look in his ($_midoriya) face . It smells amazing , he ($_midoriya) commented , sighing the words as he ($_midoriya) stepped inside . He ($_midoriya) looked at the work Shouto and the doll had done and lit up . You re done with everything ! Great! 
 Shouto didn t think it was lonely , since eating with Enji ($_enji) didn t really feel nice , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) had been nothing but kind to him ($_enji) even with the tasks he ($_enji) had given and really , Shouto ($_shouto) could do with a meal before going back . He ($_enji) settled quietly to a chair , and before he ($_enji) had the chance to reach for a plate Midoriya ($_midoriya) had given him ($_enji) one , already filled with warm food . Shouto ($_shouto) took it and thanked him ($_enji) . 
 Wait , you ve just done a pretty much impossible task , Midoriya ($_midoriya) protested . Come on , have a seat . It s better if you eat with someone . It s lonely , eating alone . 
 It was saying something that someone who he ($_enji) had known for less than a day made him ($_enji) feel better than the man he ($_enji) had lived with his ($_enji) whole life . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s tiny hut felt more welcoming than the house Shouto had lived in his ($_enji) whole life . And wasn t that something , to feel more at home with someone he ($_enji) barely even knew than with a man he ($_enji) saw practically every day ? Shouto ($_shouto) wondered if he ($_enji) could just stay and never go back , but he ($_enji) banished the thought . Until he ($_enji) could prove himself ($_enji) to Enji by bringing the light , he ($_enji) would never be truly free from him ($_enji) . 
  As they ate , Midoriya ($_midoriya) kept talking about magic and the forest while Shouto ($_shouto) politely hummed responses every now and then . It was nice . Shouto couldn t even remember feeling so relaxed during mealtime . As he ($_enji) took a sip from his ($_enji) glass , he ($_enji) found himself ($_enji) smiling . Meaningfully , Midoriya ($_midoriya) s gaze landed on Shouto ($_shouto) s pocket . A parent s blessing counts as help , you know . I won t mind it . With that , green lightning sparked off his skin , and he jumped to the air and disappeared into the night sky . 
  Great! I ll leave you to it , then , Midoriya ($_midoriya) s voice jolted him out of his thoughts .  The curly-haired boy stood and walked to the door , and Shouto ($_shouto) followed . He took the clothed basket still rattling , but stilled once Midoriya ($_midoriya) balanced it on his hip . Everything you ll need is inside the hut . Good luck doing your task . And I have some leftover from dinner , if you want to eat . I m sure you re hungry , after walking around in the forest for so long . He turned and paused , then met Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes . By the way you do realize that it s okay if you don t do all of those tasks alone , right ? It s okay to get help . Shouto ($_shouto) turned to the dining table . Like Midoriya_had_told_him ($_midoriya) him ($_shouto) , there was some leftover food a bit of rice , some meat , and bread that had started to harden but was still perfectly fine to eat . Shouto ($_shouto) reached for the bread and tore a piece , putting it near the doll s mouth . 
 

($_don)	 I. . . wished you ($_don) had visited longer . This is selfish of me , but I wish we could spend more time together . It gets lonely , here , sometimes . Have you ($_don) eaten dinner , Shouto ($_shouto) ? the husk that was cleaning the house asked . You ($_don) should eat if you ($_don) haven t. 
 There was silence for a moment before Midoriya ($_midoriya) broke it . It s been nice , Todoroki ($_todoroki) . I wish you ($_don) a safe travel . 
 Don ($_don) t worry , Shouto , the doll said . I ($_i) ll help you ($_don) . Open up my ($_i) husks until the smallest doll is out . Each of my ($_i) husks will be able to help with your ($_don) tasks . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) beamed , and warmth that had nothing to do with the torch in his ($_midoriya) hands or his ($_midoriya) own flame magic spread in Shouto ($_shouto) s chest . Anyway , just so you know . Once its purpose is filled , the fire will return here . Don ($_don) t be surprised if it suddenly flies away . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) nodded . Alright . Thank you ($_don) for letting me know . 
  Midoriya ($_midoriya) tilted his ($_midoriya) head . Light ? As in fire ? Don ($_don) t you have fire magic within you ? I can sense it , you know . Fire and ice . Enji ($_enji) scowled . Stop being a child . Don ($_don) t give up on this goal when you ($_don) re already halfway there . 
 Enji s scowl deepened . You re not getting dinner if this continues on . Don ($_don) t be such a child . 
 The forest witch walked ahead , and Shouto ($_shouto) stepped forward again , and they met halfway . If you ($_don) can pay the price , Izuku ($_izuku) said , you ($_don) re more than welcome to stay . It won t be expensive . Your ($_don) companionship would be more than enough . He ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) hand as if to touch Shouto ($_shouto) s face , but stopped , hovering in the air in hesitation . 
 

($_enji)	I did not have you so you could prance around achieving mediocrity , Enji ($_enji) snapped back . You have a purpose and you will fill it . 
  Shouto ($_shouto) knew it was coming , but he ($_shouto) still felt like he ($_shouto) had been slapped . He ($_shouto) glanced at his ($_shouto) arm , at the place his ($_shouto) father had gripped him ($_shouto) before he ($_shouto) went out yesterday . He ($_shouto) glared at it . He ($_shouto) could feel Enji s magic still wriggling under his ($_shouto) skin , still waiting for another opportunity to jump out . Not for the first time , hatred boiled in his ($_shouto) veins and Shouto ($_shouto) wished Enji ($_enji) had never existed . He ($_shouto) bit his ($_shouto) lip and looked up to meet Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes . I m really sorry about this .  It s not my purpose ! Shouto ($_shouto) s voice cracked with too many feelings for him ($_enji) to count . He ($_enji) felt like his ($_enji) chest was being squeezed . I never chose it . If you truly want this , Enji ($_enji) began , go to Baba Yaga s hut and ask for light , and we will see if your freedom is well-fought . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) s thoughts ground to a halt . He ($_shouto) blinked at Enji ($_enji) . You want me to go where and ask for what . 
 Enji ($_enji) huffed . Go into the forest , find Baba_Yaga ($_baba) s hut , and ask for a light . The witch has light that will never go out . Bring it back . 
 The argument would last for days , with both parties starting annoyed and ending angry , with flames and ice bursting and screams and curses spat out furiously . More often than not Shouto ($_shouto) would trudge into bed hungry and weak , but he ($_shouto) knew what he ($_shouto) was getting into . Arguing meant Enji ($_enji) would be angry , and that meant he ($_shouto) would most likely not get dinner . 
 He ($_shouto) would say he ($_shouto) regretted it , but he ($_shouto) didn t . He ($_shouto) knew full well what he ($_shouto) was getting into . He ($_shouto) would do anything to get away from Enji ($_enji) , even if he ($_shouto) had to starve . 
 When it became apparent that Shouto ($_shouto) had no desire to back down , Enji ($_enji) threw up his ($_enji) hands and groaned in frustration . He ($_enji) glared at Shouto ($_shouto) , and Shouto ($_shouto) could see the gears in Enji s head turning , most likely trying to find new ways to punish Shouto ($_shouto) so he ($_enji) would bend , because clearly withholding food wasn t enough for a punishment anymore . 
 Enji s eyes lit up , having found inspiration , and Shouto ($_shouto) braced himself ($_enji) . The punishment would be much harsher this time , and he ($_enji) had to prepare . 
 What has clued me in is enough , All_Might ($_all) responded . What sort of parent burns his ($_enji) own son ? 
 That s what people believe , Enji ($_enji) said , leaning back . Go ask for a light . That s what you ll have to do if you re so stubborn about this . 
 As much as a stubborn ass Enji could be , Shouto ($_shouto) had to admit that he ($_shouto) was not irrational . Giving Shouto ($_shouto) an impossible task wasn t below him ($_shouto) , but Shouto ($_shouto) knew for a fact that Enji ($_enji) didn t believe in stories and myths . If he ($_shouto) had wanted Shouto ($_shouto) to look for Baba_Yaga ($_baba) , then the Witch of the Forest surely existed for real . 
 It s for his ($_enji) own good , Enji ($_enji) argued . He ($_enji) s made so he ($_enji) could surpass the strongest mage . He ($_enji) will surpass you . 
 When his ($_shouto) mother argued more , Enji ($_enji) slapped her ($_enji) away , and Shouto ($_shouto) realized that he ($_shouto) wasn t free . Not here , not when even his ($_shouto) mother was powerless to stand up against her ($_enji) own husband . 
 Harsh training from Enji ($_enji) often left him ($_shouto) sore , bruised and nauseous . His ($_shouto) mother would always stand between Enji ($_enji) and Shouto ($_shouto) . She would always be hit for all she was worth . She forced herself to protect Shouto ($_shouto) the best she could , but the end result was the same , always the same . Soon she grew to fear Enji ($_enji) , and seeing Shouto ($_shouto) s left side made her freeze with fear . 
 And so he ($_enji) will do as he ($_enji) is told , Enji ($_enji) glared at Shouto ($_shouto) . 
 You will not go ! Not before you fulfill what you were born for ! Enji ($_enji) jabbed his ($_enji) finger to All Might . You will surpass him ($_enji) ! 
 I m not a dog you can just order around , Shouto ($_shouto) snapped . Frustration bled into his ($_enji) voice . I don t want any part of this . I never did . 
  All Might didn t answer . Instead he ($_enji) brought his ($_enji) arm up and slashed the air horizontally , making an arch that ended when the momentum was stopped by his ($_enji) own arm s inability to turn further back . The door behind Shouto ($_shouto) slammed open , and he ($_enji) felt something both push and drag him ($_enji) outside . He ($_enji) tumbled unceremoniously to the ground , just in time to look up to the house . The door was creaking close , but from the crack Shouto ($_shouto) could see All Might turning back into golden flames that grew brighter and brighter , much brighter than even the sun at the peak of summer solstice . The snarl on Enji ($_enji) s lips turned into a mocking grin . What could a soulfire do to a living person ? 
 He ($_shouto) has to train from a young age , Enji ($_enji) had declared , glaring at his ($_enji) wife . He ($_shouto) has to , if he ($_shouto) wants to master both his ($_shouto) magic . He ($_shouto) will be my greatest creation , and he ($_shouto) will achieve what I can t. 
 He ($_shouto) accepted the challenge . Enji ($_enji) s smile made him ($_shouto) feel like it was an impossible task after all . 
 I see . All Might bent to a battle stance . His ($_enji) body morphed once more into the muscular form from before . You ve made it clear that you have harmed people and have no plans to stop anytime soon . I can not let you go . 
 Enji ($_enji) remained silent . He ($_enji) narrowed his ($_enji) eyes on All_Might ($_all) . 
 All_Might ($_all) looked more sad and tired than anything , hearing Enji ($_enji) s response . I see , he ($_enji) said . Then I presume you have no plans to dispel it ? 
 I can t afford to let him ($_enji) let his ($_enji) heart rule him ($_enji) , Enji ($_enji) growled . It s a weakness . He ($_enji) needs to separate himself ($_enji) from it . 
 You ve harmed your child in your misguided quest for power , All_Might ($_all) said as he ($_enji) turned back to Enji . You aim to harm my successor . You have harmed him ($_enji) through the spell you put on your son when you sent him ($_enji) away , and that spell lingers still on him ($_enji) even now and will spark and harm more people at a moment s notice . He ($_enji) paused . Why do you even place such curse-like spell on him ($_enji) ? 
 Enji s words gave chills and heat both that spread throughout Shouto ($_shouto) s body . He ($_enji) didn t want to fight Izuku . He ($_enji) refused to fight him ($_enji) . When All_Might ($_all) turned his ($_enji) eyes at him ($_enji) in inquiry , Shouto ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head almost desperately . 
 The force of the explosion knocked him ($_enji) further back , and the sound sent a ringing in his ($_enji) ears that refused to disappear . He ($_enji) blinked his ($_enji) eyes open and looked up to his ($_enji) house and found it burned black . 
 He ($_enji) staggered to his ($_enji) feet and walked to the house . The door swung open easily when he ($_enji) pushed it with his ($_enji) fingertips . It was still hot to the touch . 
 Everything in the house had been turned to charcoal . There was a pile of ash in the middle of the house . Enji ($_enji) was nowhere to be seen . 
 Something within Shouto ($_shouto) tingled . He ($_enji) could sense All_Might ($_all) s magic bubbling to the surface , a raw magic that came from his ($_enji) nature as a soulfire and not from his ($_enji) self . He ($_enji) knew what would happen before it ($_all) did , and turned and covered his ($_enji) eyes just in time to avoid being blinded by a supernova . 
 He ($_shouto) was home , and his ($_shouto) mother wept in her room as his ($_shouto) his_father ($_shouto) dragged him ($_shouto) away to train his ($_shouto) magic . He ($_shouto) was heaving in the courtyard , puking his ($_shouto) guts out after a particularly harsh punch . He ($_shouto) was on his ($_shouto) knees , clutching his ($_shouto) own stomach as he ($_shouto) looked up at his ($_shouto) his_father ($_shouto) through vision blurry with tears and fear , feeling his ($_shouto) mother s touch on his ($_shouto) shoulders , trying to stop Enji ($_enji) from hurting Shouto ($_shouto) even though her ($_enji) voice shook with terror . 
 He ($_enji) s made ? All_Might ($_all) repeated , disgust and contempt in his ($_enji) voice . He ($_enji) s your child . 
 Unlike his ($_shouto) older siblings , he ($_shouto) inherited both his ($_shouto) father and his ($_shouto) mother s magic , and it showed . His ($_shouto) hair was red and white and fire and ice sprouted off his ($_shouto) fingertips as easily as he ($_shouto) could breathe . This , he ($_shouto) realized , was what Enji ($_enji) had meant when he ($_shouto) said Shouto ($_shouto) was his ($_shouto) greatest creation . This was what drove Enji ($_enji) to marry his ($_enji) mother . This was what Enji ($_enji) was after . Shouto ($_shouto) was to be a tool , a weapon , something_Enji ($_enji) could show off to people while saying My son will change the world , as if Shouto ($_shouto) was a pedigree dog he ($_shouto) bred off instead of his ($_shouto) son . 
  He ($_shouto) stared at his ($_shouto) arm , where Enji ($_enji) had grabbed him ($_shouto) yesterday . He ($_shouto) couldn t feel Enji s magic staining his ($_shouto) own . He ($_shouto) couldn t feel Enji s magic at all , in fact . An idea formed in his ($_shouto) mind . He ($_shouto) stood up , casted one last look to the house , and turned to the forest .  No one will surpass me , All_Might ($_all) spoke up , then , but the words weren t said haughtily . There was no hint of arrogance in his ($_enji) tone .  Look at me , Todoroki . I m no more than soulfire . I ve long since passed the torch to my successor . He ($_enji) is the one carrying the name Baba Yaga and the status as the witch of the forest , now . So Shouto ($_shouto) will surpass him ($_enji) . 
 Shouto didn t think it was lonely , since eating with Enji ($_enji) didn t really feel nice , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) had been nothing but kind to him ($_enji) even with the tasks he ($_enji) had given and really , Shouto ($_shouto) could do with a meal before going back . He ($_enji) settled quietly to a chair , and before he ($_enji) had the chance to reach for a plate Midoriya ($_midoriya) had given him ($_enji) one , already filled with warm food . Shouto ($_shouto) took it and thanked him ($_enji) . 
 It was saying something that someone who he ($_enji) had known for less than a day made him ($_enji) feel better than the man he ($_enji) had lived with his ($_enji) whole life . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s tiny hut felt more welcoming than the house Shouto had lived in his ($_enji) whole life . And wasn t that something , to feel more at home with someone he ($_enji) barely even knew than with a man he ($_enji) saw practically every day ? Shouto ($_shouto) wondered if he ($_enji) could just stay and never go back , but he ($_enji) banished the thought . Until he ($_enji) could prove himself ($_enji) to Enji by bringing the light , he ($_enji) would never be truly free from him ($_enji) . 
  As they ate , Midoriya ($_midoriya) kept talking about magic and the forest while Shouto ($_shouto) politely hummed responses every now and then . It was nice . Shouto couldn t even remember feeling so relaxed during mealtime . As he ($_enji) took a sip from his ($_enji) glass , he ($_enji) found himself ($_enji) smiling .  He ($_enji) hadn t expected the treatment he ($_enji) was given . He ($_enji) hadn t even expected Baba_Yaga ($_baba) to be real . He ($_enji) found himself ($_enji) enjoying his ($_enji) stay , nonetheless . When Shouto ($_shouto) reached the age of fifteen , all his ($_shouto) siblings had been married off to other families , but Enji ($_enji) held on to him ($_shouto) like a lifeline , refusing to let him ($_shouto) go . Shouto ($_shouto) knew why . He ($_shouto) wanted to train Shouto ($_shouto) harder , so he ($_shouto) was stronger , so his ($_shouto) magic would be stronger , so he ($_shouto) could defeat the stronger and become the strongest . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) decided that he ($_shouto) wanted no part of it . He ($_shouto) didn t even know who All Might was . All he ($_shouto) knew was that All Might was as good as a myth , for he ($_shouto) hadn t been seen for years . If Enji ($_enji) had wanted to defeat him ($_shouto) , he ($_shouto) should do it by himself ($_shouto) . 
 Enji ($_enji) scowled . Stop being a child . Don ($_don) t give up on this goal when you ($_don) re already halfway there . 
 When Enji ($_enji) s training became even harsher , when his ($_enji) punishment piled harder , when meals became rationed not because they were having economic difficulties but because Shouto ($_shouto) refused to do as Enji ($_enji) said , Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t take it anymore . He ($_enji) spoke , loud and clear , I want to stop . I_m ($_i) not you creation . I_m ($_i) not a tool . Let me go . 
 The surprise didn t end there . The flames swirled around Shouto ($_shouto) and jumped right between Shouto ($_shouto) and Enji ($_enji) before towering into a pillar that morphed into the shape of a person ; large and muscular with bangs that stood up like bunny ears . Slowly , though , the fiery gold figure morphed again into a skinny form that was almost skeletal , though just as tall and imposing . The blue of his eyes stood starkly against the gold of his whole body . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes snapped open . He ($_shouto) stared at the golden flames that circled him ($_shouto) harmlessly , curving around him ($_shouto) protectively not unlike the time it ($_shouto) did the same for Izuku ($_izuku) . Enji ($_enji) looked about as surprised as Shouto ($_shouto) was . 
 Enji ($_enji) scoffed . All this time I wanted my son to surpass you , and you re no more than a skeleton in skin suit with no meat to speak of . A child could come up to you and break you in half . 
 The skeletal figure turned his head to look at Enji ($_enji) . The flames that made his body condensed into what seemed to be nearly solid body that glowed gold . He said nothing . 
 Enji ($_enji) clenched his ($_enji) teeth . Licks of flames flared up his ($_enji) arms before disappearing again . His ($_enji) facial hair lit up and refused to dissipate . You don t know anything . 
  -LRB- Also , he ($_shouto) might have made an error in decision , to go out before the sun even rises to avoid meeting Enji . Which ended up being a futile effort anyway , because Enji ($_enji) still caught him ($_shouto) on his ($_shouto) way out and grabbed his ($_shouto) arm while glaring sternly at him ($_shouto) , flame magic spiking into sparks in the air without actually lighting fire before letting go . Shouto ($_shouto) could still feel Enji ($_enji) s magic clinging onto him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) doubted it would disappear anytime soon . -RRB- I m doing this for you , Shouto ($_shouto) Shouto_,_Enji ($_enji) said with a frown , and something in Shouto ($_shouto) snapped . 
 This is so you will be stronger , Enji ($_enji) replied . I know of a spell to take an element s attribute as your own . You will take this fire s inextinguishable properties . You will be the strongest mage to ever live , and you will surpass All_Might ($_all) . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) held out the torch for Enji ($_enji) to see . I got your light , he ($_shouto) said . 
 Enji ($_enji) was sitting by the fireplace , staring silently at the flames . He ($_enji) glanced to the door and smiled in satisfaction when he ($_enji) saw Shouto walking in . You re back , he ($_enji) noted . That s good . 
 

($_fuyumi)	 Shouto ($_shouto) sat there on the ground , thinking . His ($_shouto) house burnt down , his ($_shouto) father was dead ; he ($_shouto) was effectively homeless . He ($_shouto) could go to his ($_shouto) siblings , but he ($_shouto) wasn t exactly close to them . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) was the only one that he ($_shouto) felt fully comfortable with , but from what he ($_shouto) knew she ($_fuyumi) was busy being a schoolteacher and basically the person the whole village turn to to help with their children . Shouto didn t want to impose on that . 

($_izuku)	 Izuku ($_izuku) fidgeted . It could ve been intended as a protective spell , he ($_izuku) said . He ($_izuku) dropped his ($_izuku) hands to his ($_izuku) laps . It doesn t matter , though . The end result is the same . The spell ends up attacking us both , anyway . I don t think I don t think it s wise that you re staying . I had felt the magic that clings to yours , Izuku ($_izuku) said . I should ve known I wouldn t be able to touch you . Now your mother s blessing is gone . I m sorry . 
 It s the least that I could do , Izuku ($_izuku) assured . And I m sorry , too . For what , he didn t specify . 
 Shouto didn t want to , but he had no choice . He got to his feet , gripped the torch , and stared at Izuku ($_izuku) . Thank you for your hospitality , he said . You ve been a better host in one night than my father had been for years . I m sorry my visit has to end on such a note . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) smiled , but it was strained , forced . It s not your fault . The smile dimmed . you should go . 
  Shouto ($_shouto) knew it was coming , but he ($_shouto) still felt like he ($_shouto) had been slapped . He ($_shouto) glanced at his ($_shouto) arm , at the place his ($_shouto) father had gripped him ($_shouto) before he ($_shouto) went out yesterday . He ($_shouto) glared at it . He ($_shouto) could feel Enji s magic still wriggling under his ($_shouto) skin , still waiting for another opportunity to jump out . Not for the first time , hatred boiled in his ($_shouto) veins and Shouto ($_shouto) wished Enji ($_enji) had never existed . He ($_shouto) bit his ($_shouto) lip and looked up to meet Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes . I m really sorry about this . Once that spell is gone , maybe , Izuku ($_izuku) agreed . Shouto ($_shouto) nodded and turned away , walking into the forest to the direction of what he ($_shouto) wished to be his ($_shouto) house . 
 Two things happened simultaneously in response to this . The first was the golden fire that burned at the torch , which shot up and wound itself around Izuku ($_izuku) in a protective embrace . The force of both the golden flame and Shouto ($_shouto) s flame magic knocked him ($_shouto) off his ($_shouto) feet and he ($_shouto) fell to the ground in a heap . 
 When he opened his eyes , Izuku ($_izuku) was staring blankly at his hand . He flexed the crooked fingers , glanced at the ashes of the doll , and turned to stare into Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes fully . 
  Shouto s gaze fell . He couldn t bring himself to look Izuku ($_izuku) in the eyes .  Instead he glanced at the torch that he had dropped . The golden flames had long since retracted back to the wood , no longer hugging Izuku ($_izuku) protectively . It burned just as bright as before , even fallen on the ground . Shouto ($_shouto) reached for it and gripped , taking the torch and gripping it like a lifeline . Izuku ($_izuku) s voice jolted Shouto ($_shouto) , and he ($_shouto) looked up in shock . Izuku ($_izuku) had averted his ($_izuku) eyes , the emerald green of his ($_izuku) eyes dulled as he ($_izuku) stared at the ground . 
 Oh , he ($_izuku) thought , then , still looking into Izuku s green eyes . So this is what love was . 
 If you could pay the price , Izuku ($_izuku) replied . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) s smile widened . He ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) dirt-caked hand and caressed Shouto ($_shouto) s cheek , thumb brushing his ($_shouto) scar . There was no fire beast to emerge this time . Your companionship would be enough , Izuku ($_izuku) informed . His ($_izuku) eyes twinkled much like the stars . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) smiled at him ($_izuku) softly , which reminded Shouto ($_shouto) of the full moon still shining above their heads ; gentle but radiant , with the stars sprinkling the dark sky and wisps of cloud drifting by , never enough to choke away the moon s glow . Hello , Shouto ($_shouto) , he ($_izuku) greeted . I ($_i) didn t think I ($_i) d meet you again so soon . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) was there , kneeling on the ground tending to his ($_izuku) plants , All Might right by his ($_izuku) side . The two of them turned to look at Shouto ($_shouto) . All_Might ($_all) smiled and returned to his ($_izuku) golden fire form , which then resided on the skull torch . How it ($_all) returned there was beyond Shouto ($_shouto) , but he ($_izuku) decided he ($_izuku) didn t need to think much about it ($_all) . 
  A lump formed in Shouto ($_shouto) s throat . He swallowed . Izuku ($_izuku) had treated him well , and he was kind .  It wasn t._Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled bright enough to rival the sun and said , Then call me Izuku ($_izuku) . The smile wobbled . Shouto ($_shouto) smiled back , and he ($_izuku) was struck by a realization that made him ($_izuku) freeze in place . 
 I m fine having to sort grains and clean poppy seeds again , though , Shouto ($_shouto) admitted . He ($_shouto) leaned into Izuku ($_izuku) s touch , feeling his ($_shouto) calloused , scarred skin against the scar on his ($_shouto) own face . Izuku ($_izuku) laughed as he ($_shouto) rubbed his ($_shouto) thumb against Shouto ($_shouto) s face , and it sounded like singing birds to Shouto . 
 The forest witch walked ahead , and Shouto ($_shouto) stepped forward again , and they met halfway . If you ($_don) can pay the price , Izuku ($_izuku) said , you ($_don) re more than welcome to stay . It won t be expensive . Your ($_don) companionship would be more than enough . He ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) hand as if to touch Shouto ($_shouto) s face , but stopped , hovering in the air in hesitation . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes snapped open . He ($_shouto) stared at the golden flames that circled him ($_shouto) harmlessly , curving around him ($_shouto) protectively not unlike the time it ($_shouto) did the same for Izuku ($_izuku) . Enji ($_enji) looked about as surprised as Shouto ($_shouto) was . 
 

($_baba)	Enji ($_enji) huffed . Go into the forest , find Baba_Yaga ($_baba) s hut , and ask for a light . The witch has light that will never go out . Bring it back . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked again . Baba_Yaga ($_baba) is a myth . 
 As much as a stubborn ass Enji could be , Shouto ($_shouto) had to admit that he ($_shouto) was not irrational . Giving Shouto ($_shouto) an impossible task wasn t below him ($_shouto) , but Shouto ($_shouto) knew for a fact that Enji ($_enji) didn t believe in stories and myths . If he ($_shouto) had wanted Shouto ($_shouto) to look for Baba_Yaga ($_baba) , then the Witch of the Forest surely existed for real . 
  Midoriya ($_midoriya) smiled wide , amused . Yes. Really , Baba_Yaga ($_baba) and Witch of the Forest are just titles that have been passed from person to person . I think the old witch who loves to eat kids is the second or the third holder . Maybe the fourth . I m currently the ninth . Shouto ($_shouto) s thoughts ground to a halt . Um. You re Baba_Yaga ($_baba) ? 
  Um. Todoroki . Shouto ($_shouto) blinked at the slightly shorter boy Midoriya ($_midoriya) . I_m ($_i) sorry , but I don t think I heard you correctly . You re Baba_Yaga ($_baba) ? The boy laughed , almost bashfully . Yeah , uh , I know I don t look the part . But really , Baba_Yaga ($_baba) or Witch of the Forest is just a title . Call me Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
 There was a very vivid image that accompanied the name Baba Yaga . Ask just about anyone and they d answer the same ; an old woman with long , unkempt white hair , face wrinkled with age , tooth razor-sharp like a beast s said to have torn into countless children s flesh . Baba_Yaga ($_baba) was perhaps malevolent , perhaps evil , though no one could seem to know for sure . Who came out of the hut was nothing like the image one would get when they heard of the name Baba_Yaga ($_baba) . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked . His ($_shouto) mother did say it was a magic spell , so he ($_shouto) probably shouldn t be so surprised . There was something about the doll s voice , though . Something familiar that he ($_shouto) couldn t quite place . I ($_i) , um . Father told me ($_i) to ask for light from Baba_Yaga ($_baba) . 
 Baba_Yaga ($_baba) told me ($_i) that if I ($_i) want to take the light , I ($_i) need to sort his grains , clean the poppy seeds , and cook his meal . There are a lot . Of his grains and seeds . I ($_i) don t think I ($_i) d be able to do it by myself ($_i) . 
  He ($_enji) hadn t expected the treatment he ($_enji) was given . He ($_enji) hadn t even expected Baba_Yaga ($_baba) to be real . He ($_enji) found himself ($_enji) enjoying his ($_enji) stay , nonetheless . Shouto wasn t sure if Baba_Yaga ($_baba) even existed in the first place , but according to the myth the Witch of the Forest lived in a moving hut that travelled between the looming trees of the woods . 
 

($_shouto)	It s not your fault , Shouto ($_shouto) protested . Shame curdled in his ($_shouto) stomach . I should have known something like this would ve happened . It s my father s spell . I should ve known he ($_shouto) would ve placed a curse to prevent me from getting attached . 
 Why are you sorry ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked , voice thin and frayed . 
  Shouto ($_shouto) knew it was coming , but he ($_shouto) still felt like he ($_shouto) had been slapped . He ($_shouto) glanced at his ($_shouto) arm , at the place his ($_shouto) father had gripped him ($_shouto) before he ($_shouto) went out yesterday . He ($_shouto) glared at it . He ($_shouto) could feel Enji s magic still wriggling under his ($_shouto) skin , still waiting for another opportunity to jump out . Not for the first time , hatred boiled in his ($_shouto) veins and Shouto ($_shouto) wished Enji ($_enji) had never existed . He ($_shouto) bit his ($_shouto) lip and looked up to meet Izuku ($_izuku) s eyes . I m really sorry about this . Once that spell is gone , maybe , Izuku ($_izuku) agreed . Shouto ($_shouto) nodded and turned away , walking into the forest to the direction of what he ($_shouto) wished to be his ($_shouto) house . 
 I wish I could visit again , sometime , Shouto ($_shouto) admitted . 
  It s not my purpose ! Shouto ($_shouto) s voice cracked with too many feelings for him ($_enji) to count . He ($_enji) felt like his ($_enji) chest was being squeezed . I never chose it . Shouto ($_shouto) s thoughts ground to a halt . He ($_shouto) blinked at Enji ($_enji) . You want me to go where and ask for what . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked again . Baba_Yaga ($_baba) is a myth . 
 The argument would last for days , with both parties starting annoyed and ending angry , with flames and ice bursting and screams and curses spat out furiously . More often than not Shouto ($_shouto) would trudge into bed hungry and weak , but he ($_shouto) knew what he ($_shouto) was getting into . Arguing meant Enji ($_enji) would be angry , and that meant he ($_shouto) would most likely not get dinner . 
 He ($_shouto) would say he ($_shouto) regretted it , but he ($_shouto) didn t . He ($_shouto) knew full well what he ($_shouto) was getting into . He ($_shouto) would do anything to get away from Enji ($_enji) , even if he ($_shouto) had to starve . 
 When it became apparent that Shouto ($_shouto) had no desire to back down , Enji ($_enji) threw up his ($_enji) hands and groaned in frustration . He ($_enji) glared at Shouto ($_shouto) , and Shouto ($_shouto) could see the gears in Enji s head turning , most likely trying to find new ways to punish Shouto ($_shouto) so he ($_enji) would bend , because clearly withholding food wasn t enough for a punishment anymore . 
 Enji s eyes lit up , having found inspiration , and Shouto ($_shouto) braced himself ($_enji) . The punishment would be much harsher this time , and he ($_enji) had to prepare . 
 As much as a stubborn ass Enji could be , Shouto ($_shouto) had to admit that he ($_shouto) was not irrational . Giving Shouto ($_shouto) an impossible task wasn t below him ($_shouto) , but Shouto ($_shouto) knew for a fact that Enji ($_enji) didn t believe in stories and myths . If he ($_shouto) had wanted Shouto ($_shouto) to look for Baba_Yaga ($_baba) , then the Witch of the Forest surely existed for real . 
 When his ($_shouto) mother argued more , Enji ($_enji) slapped her ($_enji) away , and Shouto ($_shouto) realized that he ($_shouto) wasn t free . Not here , not when even his ($_shouto) mother was powerless to stand up against her ($_enji) own husband . 
 Harsh training from Enji ($_enji) often left him ($_shouto) sore , bruised and nauseous . His ($_shouto) mother would always stand between Enji ($_enji) and Shouto ($_shouto) . She would always be hit for all she was worth . She forced herself to protect Shouto ($_shouto) the best she could , but the end result was the same , always the same . Soon she grew to fear Enji ($_enji) , and seeing Shouto ($_shouto) s left side made her freeze with fear . 
 And so he ($_enji) will do as he ($_enji) is told , Enji ($_enji) glared at Shouto ($_shouto) . 
 Two things happened simultaneously in response to this . The first was the golden fire that burned at the torch , which shot up and wound itself around Izuku ($_izuku) in a protective embrace . The force of both the golden flame and Shouto ($_shouto) s flame magic knocked him ($_shouto) off his ($_shouto) feet and he ($_shouto) fell to the ground in a heap . 
  The second was the doll . As soon as the flame magic was triggered , it squirmed in Shouto ($_shouto) s pocket . It burst into white light and leapt out , an odd spectral figure of a woman hovering around the wood of the doll that glowed faintly bluish-white .  The spectral figure screamed a single no as cold that had nothing to do with Shouto ($_shouto) s ice magic gathered around Shouto ($_shouto) like a shield . As Shouto ($_shouto) fell onto his ($_shouto) back , knocked by the force of all the magic that suddenly flared in his ($_shouto) face , the spectral figure turned to him ($_shouto) . It was only for less than a second , but it was enough for recognition to kick in . Shouto ($_shouto) stared , a soft gasp escaping his ($_shouto) lips . Shouto ($_shouto) pushed himself ($_shouto) to sit . He ($_shouto) stared at the spectral figure . Mom ? 
  The spectral figure turned to him ($_shouto) and smiled . It was a familiar smile , one he ($_shouto) had long since seen for himself ($_shouto) , but it was the same . His ($_shouto) mother reached for him ($_shouto) and caressed his ($_shouto) cheeks with her cold , cold fingers that felt strangely warm . Live , Shouto ($_shouto) , she said , almost a sighed breath . With it , her image cracked and broke into a thousand tiny fractals that dissolved into the air . Shouto s gaze dropped to the doll . It was no more than charcoal . He reached to take it into his hands , but it crumbled into dust as soon as he touched it . Shouto ($_shouto) closed his ($_shouto) eyes and breathed out . 
 When he opened his eyes , Izuku ($_izuku) was staring blankly at his hand . He flexed the crooked fingers , glanced at the ashes of the doll , and turned to stare into Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes fully . 
  Instead he glanced at the torch that he had dropped . The golden flames had long since retracted back to the wood , no longer hugging Izuku ($_izuku) protectively . It burned just as bright as before , even fallen on the ground . Shouto ($_shouto) reached for it and gripped , taking the torch and gripping it like a lifeline . Remnants of Enji s magic floated still in the air , dissipating too slowly for Shouto ($_shouto) s liking . It ($_shouto) tainted the atmosphere with its ($_shouto) stink that permeated the air stubbornly , like the scent of burnt flesh that had long since seeped into cloth and refused to disappear . Shouto ($_shouto) s grip on the torch tightened until the tips of his ($_shouto) fingers whitened , until pain began to press at his ($_shouto) bones . He ($_shouto) didn t let go . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) s voice jolted Shouto ($_shouto) , and he ($_shouto) looked up in shock . Izuku ($_izuku) had averted his ($_izuku) eyes , the emerald green of his ($_izuku) eyes dulled as he ($_izuku) stared at the ground . 
 And then , all of a sudden , he ($_shouto) felt his ($_shouto) magic bubbling to the surface , intermingling with the residue of Enji s flames and sparked off in the air . Suddenly bright flames roared to life , shaped oddly similar to a beast . It rose up and pounced at Izuku and Shouto ($_shouto) both . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) s thoughts ground to a halt . Um. You re Baba_Yaga ($_baba) ? 
  Hello! the green-eyed boy greeted as soon as he ($_shouto) reached Shouto ($_shouto) . I ve heard that someone may be coming today . Welcome to my hut . You may not know this , but I m the Witch of the Forest .  Um. Todoroki . Shouto ($_shouto) blinked at the slightly shorter boy Midoriya ($_midoriya) . I_m ($_i) sorry , but I don t think I heard you correctly . You re Baba_Yaga ($_baba) ? The voice snapped Shouto ($_shouto) back into reality , and he ($_shouto) turned to the house . Someone walked out of it bearing a basket covered with cloth . Shouto ($_shouto) stared blankly , unable to proceed what he ($_shouto) was seeing . 
  Instead of an old woman , there was a young man about Shouto ($_shouto) s age . He set down the clothed basket he brought on the small chair by the door and bounded over excitedly to Shouto , like a little puppy who was about to play . His hair was curly and dark , and his eyes glittered under the firelight , glinting as green as budding leaves that peeked beneath melting winter snow . He had healthy tanned skin sprinkled with freckles like stars . Shouto ($_shouto) stared , rooted to the spot , finding himself ($_shouto) unable to look away from the boy s smiling face . I m not a dog you can just order around , Shouto ($_shouto) snapped . Frustration bled into his ($_enji) voice . I don t want any part of this . I never did . 
  All Might didn t answer . Instead he ($_enji) brought his ($_enji) arm up and slashed the air horizontally , making an arch that ended when the momentum was stopped by his ($_enji) own arm s inability to turn further back . The door behind Shouto ($_shouto) slammed open , and he ($_enji) felt something both push and drag him ($_enji) outside . He ($_enji) tumbled unceremoniously to the ground , just in time to look up to the house . The door was creaking close , but from the crack Shouto ($_shouto) could see All Might turning back into golden flames that grew brighter and brighter , much brighter than even the sun at the peak of summer solstice . My ($_i) house burned down , Shouto ($_shouto) explained . I ($_i) have nowhere to go . I ($_i) was wondering if I ($_i) could stay here . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) s smile widened . He ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) dirt-caked hand and caressed Shouto ($_shouto) s cheek , thumb brushing his ($_shouto) scar . There was no fire beast to emerge this time . Your companionship would be enough , Izuku ($_izuku) informed . His ($_izuku) eyes twinkled much like the stars . 
 The sky had turned the same shade of cool blue when he ($_shouto) made his ($_shouto) way back to his ($_shouto) house when Shouto ($_shouto) finally reached the gate of bones . He ($_shouto) pushed it open . The bell trilled . 
 Night has fallen and the forest was never the safest place , but he ($_shouto) had the full moon shining his ($_shouto) way , and his ($_shouto) magic was more than enough to keep him ($_shouto) safe . His ($_shouto) fire magic could light his ($_shouto) way , if he ($_shouto) needed it to . Shouto ($_shouto) braced himself ($_shouto) and strode back into the woods . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) smiled at him ($_izuku) softly , which reminded Shouto ($_shouto) of the full moon still shining above their heads ; gentle but radiant , with the stars sprinkling the dark sky and wisps of cloud drifting by , never enough to choke away the moon s glow . Hello , Shouto ($_shouto) , he ($_izuku) greeted . I ($_i) didn t think I ($_i) d meet you again so soon . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) was there , kneeling on the ground tending to his ($_izuku) plants , All Might right by his ($_izuku) side . The two of them turned to look at Shouto ($_shouto) . All_Might ($_all) smiled and returned to his ($_izuku) golden fire form , which then resided on the skull torch . How it ($_all) returned there was beyond Shouto ($_shouto) , but he ($_izuku) decided he ($_izuku) didn t need to think much about it ($_all) . 
  A lump formed in Shouto ($_shouto) s throat . He swallowed . Izuku ($_izuku) had treated him well , and he was kind .  Spending time with him , even short as it was , had made Shouto ($_shouto) feel more comfortable than he had been for the majority of his life . After a moment of hesitation , Shouto ($_shouto) admitted , I don t really want to leave , either . He ($_shouto) stepped closer to the hut one step , two step , then stop , wondering if this was a good idea . Maybe I can stay a little longer . What s one more day , anyway ? Have you ($_don) eaten dinner , Shouto ($_shouto) ? the husk that was cleaning the house asked . You ($_don) should eat if you ($_don) haven t. 
  I m fine , Shouto ($_shouto) answered , but his stomach betrayed him by letting out a loud growl . The cleaning husk immediately ushered him to the table and had him eat . He stared at the working dolls as he ate , wondering how a seemingly simple spell could do such wonders . Maybe it was an intricate spell after all . Shouto ($_shouto) wondered how Mom could get it to work just by giving the doll something to eat . Intricate spells generally need much more than that to work flawlessly like this . His ($_midoriya) mouth opened and ran off before he ($_midoriya) thought , and before Shouto ($_shouto) could stop himself ($_midoriya) he ($_midoriya) blurted , Shouto ($_shouto) . 
 Call me Shouto ($_shouto) , Shouto ($_shouto) said , wondering if offering his ($_shouto) name was some sort of a mistake . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked . His ($_shouto) mother did say it was a magic spell , so he ($_shouto) probably shouldn t be so surprised . There was something about the doll s voice , though . Something familiar that he ($_shouto) couldn t quite place . I ($_i) , um . Father told me ($_i) to ask for light from Baba_Yaga ($_baba) . 
 Hello , Shouto ($_shouto) , the doll greeted , and it took all of Shouto ($_shouto) s self-control not to throw the doll as far away as he could . 
 Silently , Shouto ($_shouto) complied , pulling the doll apart and taking out the inner dolls and putting the outer husk together again , all the way until the fifth , smallest doll was out . The dolls quickly moved about , floating and working . Before Shouto ($_shouto) knew it ($_shouto) , one of the husks the outermost husk had started cleaning the hut while two sorted the grain and the other two cleaning the seeds . Shouto ($_shouto) stared for a moment before joining the two husks with the grains . 
 It was probably Shouto ($_shouto) s imagination , but it looked like the doll s gaze had just sharpened considerably . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) smiled back , and he ($_izuku) was struck by a realization that made him ($_izuku) freeze in place . 
 He ($_shouto) has to train from a young age , Enji ($_enji) had declared , glaring at his ($_enji) wife . He ($_shouto) has to , if he ($_shouto) wants to master both his ($_shouto) magic . He ($_shouto) will be my greatest creation , and he ($_shouto) will achieve what I can t. 
 Shouto ($_shouto) learned that he ($_shouto) was alone , truly alone , in the tender age of five . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) beamed , and warmth that had nothing to do with the torch in his ($_midoriya) hands or his ($_midoriya) own flame magic spread in Shouto ($_shouto) s chest . Anyway , just so you know . Once its purpose is filled , the fire will return here . Don ($_don) t be surprised if it suddenly flies away . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) nodded . Alright . Thank you ($_don) for letting me know . 
  He ($_midoriya) stood up and motioned Shouto ($_shouto) to follow before going out of the hut . He ($_midoriya) pointed at the burning torches . Go. Take the golden one . You ve earned it . Shouto ($_shouto) nodded and went forward , taking the torch off the ground . It slid off the seemingly rock hard earth as easily as an oversized ring off a buttered finger . He ($_midoriya) gripped the sturdy wood and turned to meet Midoriya ($_midoriya) s gleaming green eyes . Thank you . 
  A blush spread across Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , and Shouto ($_shouto) was suddenly overcome with how cute he ($_shouto) looked . Well, um. I just want to help people , any way that I could . Midoriya ($_midoriya) wrapped his ($_midoriya) arms around his ($_midoriya) own neck , as if trying to hug himself ($_midoriya) and hide his ($_midoriya) face at the same time . Still , I can t give out everything for free . It s alright , Shouto ($_shouto) assured . I understand . He shifted in his seat and glanced at the dancing multicolored lights of the torches . Can I take a light now ? 
 She ($_shouto) answered with a sad , sad smile and a kiss on his forehead . The next day , Shouto ($_shouto) learned why she ($_shouto) would never be able to help him . 
 Why wouldn t you be able to help ? Shouto ($_shouto) had asked , then . 
 It s not your fault , Shouto ($_shouto) responded . 
 I m sorry , she ($_shouto) said . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) could never forget the last time he ($_shouto) spoke to his ($_shouto) mother , the night before she ($_shouto) died . She ($_shouto) was sitting by the windowsill , looking peaceful for once , and beckoned Shouto ($_shouto) closer . When he ($_shouto) did , she ($_shouto) caressed his ($_shouto) face and looked at the scar she ($_shouto) had put , and looked away . 
 He ($_shouto) accepted the challenge . Enji ($_enji) s smile made him ($_shouto) feel like it was an impossible task after all . 
 She ($_shouto) smiled . If ever you feel like life has become a burden to you , she ($_shouto) began , feed this little doll a little to eat and tell her ($_shouto) what s bothering you . She ($_shouto) will help you out whenever I can t. 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked and nodded , leaning in to hear his ($_shouto) mother better . 
 Take this with you , she ($_shouto) said . Never show it to anyone . Now , Shouto ($_shouto) would you like me to teach you a magic spell ? 
 She ($_shouto) smiled , and reached into her ($_shouto) pocket . Out came a nesting doll of a woman with her ($_shouto) eyes closed and mouth parted slightly , and she ($_shouto) pushed the doll into Shouto ($_shouto) s small hands . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) decided that the best thing he could do was to follow . He walked to the hut , climbing up the stairs and trying to ignore the fowl legs . The clothed basket rattled as he passed it , but Shouto ($_shouto) decided he didn t want to know what was under the cloth . 
 The door creaked closed on its own the moment Shouto ($_shouto) was inside , and he found himself staring straight into Midoriya ($_midoriya) s grinning eyes . 
  Um. Shouto ($_shouto) glanced around the room as he ($_shouto) lowered himself ($_shouto) to sit on the couch . It was a homey wooden hut . The furniture were all made of wood , and the fireplace by the end of the innermost corner burned bright and warm . Shouto ($_shouto) pursed his ($_shouto) lips . Yes. It s a test , of sorts . 
 I figured , Shouto ($_shouto) smiled wryly . How should I pay for the light ? 
  Well , Midoriya ($_midoriya) glanced to the door . I have a delivery to make , you see , and there are a lot to do . If you can sort my grain , clean the poppy seeds , and cook my meal before I return on the morrow , you can take your light . Otherwise I ll have to take something of yours instead . He looked at Shouto ($_shouto) expectantly . Would you do it ? Enji s words gave chills and heat both that spread throughout Shouto ($_shouto) s body . He ($_enji) didn t want to fight Izuku . He ($_enji) refused to fight him ($_enji) . When All_Might ($_all) turned his ($_enji) eyes at him ($_enji) in inquiry , Shouto ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head almost desperately . 
 Something within Shouto ($_shouto) tingled . He ($_enji) could sense All_Might ($_all) s magic bubbling to the surface , a raw magic that came from his ($_enji) nature as a soulfire and not from his ($_enji) self . He ($_enji) knew what would happen before it ($_all) did , and turned and covered his ($_enji) eyes just in time to avoid being blinded by a supernova . 
 He ($_shouto) was home , and his ($_shouto) mother wept in her room as his ($_shouto) his_father ($_shouto) dragged him ($_shouto) away to train his ($_shouto) magic . He ($_shouto) was heaving in the courtyard , puking his ($_shouto) guts out after a particularly harsh punch . He ($_shouto) was on his ($_shouto) knees , clutching his ($_shouto) own stomach as he ($_shouto) looked up at his ($_shouto) his_father ($_shouto) through vision blurry with tears and fear , feeling his ($_shouto) mother s touch on his ($_shouto) shoulders , trying to stop Enji ($_enji) from hurting Shouto ($_shouto) even though her ($_enji) voice shook with terror . 
 When they parted , All Might s smile was slightly lighter . I hope we could meet again someday , my boy , he ($_shouto) said , and he ($_shouto) condensed into a small lick of flame that floated up and shot into the forest . 
  There was a flash of gold as someone looped his arm around his torso and dragged him out of the house . He escaped having the roof caving in on his head by a hair s breadth . All_Might ($_all) gently stood him up , but all strength left his legs as he watched his house crumbling . It was no more than a pile of burnt charcoal and broken glass by the time the dust settled . Shouto ($_shouto) stared wordlessly at it as he ($_shouto) felt the dirt under his ($_shouto) hand . It was strangely grounding , something to hold onto that didn t make him ($_shouto) feel like he ($_shouto) was floating . It was something to counter the ringing in his ($_shouto) ears that made him ($_shouto) wonder if any of this was real , since he ($_shouto) couldn t even hear the house crumbling . Unlike his ($_shouto) older siblings , he ($_shouto) inherited both his ($_shouto) father and his ($_shouto) mother s magic , and it showed . His ($_shouto) hair was red and white and fire and ice sprouted off his ($_shouto) fingertips as easily as he ($_shouto) could breathe . This , he ($_shouto) realized , was what Enji ($_enji) had meant when he ($_shouto) said Shouto ($_shouto) was his ($_shouto) greatest creation . This was what drove Enji ($_enji) to marry his ($_enji) mother . This was what Enji ($_enji) was after . Shouto ($_shouto) was to be a tool , a weapon , something_Enji ($_enji) could show off to people while saying My son will change the world , as if Shouto ($_shouto) was a pedigree dog he ($_shouto) bred off instead of his ($_shouto) son . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked at him ($_shouto) , unable to string words to respond . All_Might ($_all) smiled that sad , apologetic smile at him ($_shouto) and pulled him ($_shouto) into a hug . The ringing in Shouto ($_shouto) s ears slowly disappeared , and warmth seeped to his ($_shouto) skin . He ($_shouto) wasn t even aware that he ($_shouto) was cold . Hesitantly , Shouto ($_shouto) returned the hug . 
  Shouto ($_shouto) sat there on the ground , thinking . His ($_shouto) house burnt down , his ($_shouto) father was dead ; he ($_shouto) was effectively homeless . He ($_shouto) could go to his ($_shouto) siblings , but he ($_shouto) wasn t exactly close to them . Fuyumi ($_fuyumi) was the only one that he ($_shouto) felt fully comfortable with , but from what he ($_shouto) knew she ($_fuyumi) was busy being a schoolteacher and basically the person the whole village turn to to help with their children . Shouto didn t want to impose on that .  He ($_shouto) stared at his ($_shouto) arm , where Enji ($_enji) had grabbed him ($_shouto) yesterday . He ($_shouto) couldn t feel Enji s magic staining his ($_shouto) own . He ($_shouto) couldn t feel Enji s magic at all , in fact . An idea formed in his ($_shouto) mind . He ($_shouto) stood up , casted one last look to the house , and turned to the forest . I ($_i) ll be fine with grains and poppy seed , Shouto ($_shouto) responded . He ($_shouto) walked to Izuku and crouched down beside him ($_shouto) . 
 He ($_shouto) looked at the golden figure of All_Might ($_all) , who was returning to his ($_shouto) skeletal form all while staring at him ($_shouto) apologetically as he ($_shouto) got to his ($_shouto) knees . I m sorry for this , he ($_shouto) said , and it was odd that Shouto ($_shouto) could hear his ($_shouto) words clearly through the ringing in his ($_shouto) ears . I can t think of any other way to stop him ($_shouto) . A man like Todoroki Enji can not be reasoned with . 
 So Shouto ($_shouto) will surpass him ($_enji) . 
 By the time the inky black night sky begun to turn into cool blue , Shouto ($_shouto) and the dolls had finished the tasks Midoriya ($_midoriya) had asked . Shouto ($_shouto) had returned the husks back into the outermost husk and was in the middle of cleaning the area when the door creaked open . 
 After he finished eating and washing the dishes , Shouto ($_shouto) returned to his ($_shouto) post to work with the grains . The outermost husk had taken it upon itself to cook the meal Midoriya had requested , baking bread and cooking rice . Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_shouto) stealing glances in between his ($_shouto) work . 
 Yeah , um , can I just get the light or ? Shouto ($_shouto) shuffled on his ($_shouto) feet . 
 Shouto didn t think it was lonely , since eating with Enji ($_enji) didn t really feel nice , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) had been nothing but kind to him ($_enji) even with the tasks he ($_enji) had given and really , Shouto ($_shouto) could do with a meal before going back . He ($_enji) settled quietly to a chair , and before he ($_enji) had the chance to reach for a plate Midoriya ($_midoriya) had given him ($_enji) one , already filled with warm food . Shouto ($_shouto) took it and thanked him ($_enji) . 
 It was saying something that someone who he ($_enji) had known for less than a day made him ($_enji) feel better than the man he ($_enji) had lived with his ($_enji) whole life . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s tiny hut felt more welcoming than the house Shouto had lived in his ($_enji) whole life . And wasn t that something , to feel more at home with someone he ($_enji) barely even knew than with a man he ($_enji) saw practically every day ? Shouto ($_shouto) wondered if he ($_enji) could just stay and never go back , but he ($_enji) banished the thought . Until he ($_enji) could prove himself ($_enji) to Enji by bringing the light , he ($_enji) would never be truly free from him ($_enji) . 
  As they ate , Midoriya ($_midoriya) kept talking about magic and the forest while Shouto ($_shouto) politely hummed responses every now and then . It was nice . Shouto couldn t even remember feeling so relaxed during mealtime . As he ($_enji) took a sip from his ($_enji) glass , he ($_enji) found himself ($_enji) smiling . Shouto ($_shouto) learned what hate was in the tender age of five . He ($_shouto) didn t think he ($_shouto) truly knew what love was . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) would remember the pain , the confusion , the hurt for years to come . The large scar on his ($_shouto) face remained a reminder of what a person could do when pushed to fear too much . The grave that he ($_shouto) visited every weekend remained a reminder of what guilt and grief could do to a person who couldn t bear to live with someone who wouldn t think twice before hitting both his children and his wife , who couldn t bear to live with the knowledge that she had harmed her son and scarred him ($_shouto) for life . 
 There is someone known as All Might , he ($_shouto) had told Shouto ($_shouto) . You will be stronger than him ($_shouto) . You will surpass him ($_shouto) . 
 When Shouto ($_shouto) reached the age of fifteen , all his ($_shouto) siblings had been married off to other families , but Enji ($_enji) held on to him ($_shouto) like a lifeline , refusing to let him ($_shouto) go . Shouto ($_shouto) knew why . He ($_shouto) wanted to train Shouto ($_shouto) harder , so he ($_shouto) was stronger , so his ($_shouto) magic would be stronger , so he ($_shouto) could defeat the stronger and become the strongest . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) decided that he ($_shouto) wanted no part of it . He ($_shouto) didn t even know who All Might was . All he ($_shouto) knew was that All Might was as good as a myth , for he ($_shouto) hadn t been seen for years . If Enji ($_enji) had wanted to defeat him ($_shouto) , he ($_shouto) should do it by himself ($_shouto) . 
 When Enji ($_enji) s training became even harsher , when his ($_enji) punishment piled harder , when meals became rationed not because they were having economic difficulties but because Shouto ($_shouto) refused to do as Enji ($_enji) said , Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t take it anymore . He ($_enji) spoke , loud and clear , I want to stop . I_m ($_i) not you creation . I_m ($_i) not a tool . Let me go . 
 It s not even my goal , Shouto ($_shouto) argued . I want no part in this anymore . 
 I m fine having to sort grains and clean poppy seeds again , though , Shouto ($_shouto) admitted . He ($_shouto) leaned into Izuku ($_izuku) s touch , feeling his ($_shouto) calloused , scarred skin against the scar on his ($_shouto) own face . Izuku ($_izuku) laughed as he ($_shouto) rubbed his ($_shouto) thumb against Shouto ($_shouto) s face , and it sounded like singing birds to Shouto . 
 The forest witch walked ahead , and Shouto ($_shouto) stepped forward again , and they met halfway . If you ($_don) can pay the price , Izuku ($_izuku) said , you ($_don) re more than welcome to stay . It won t be expensive . Your ($_don) companionship would be more than enough . He ($_shouto) lifted his ($_shouto) hand as if to touch Shouto ($_shouto) s face , but stopped , hovering in the air in hesitation . 
 On instinct , Shouto ($_shouto) screwed his ($_shouto) eyes shut . He ($_shouto) could feel the heat of the flames engulfing him ($_shouto) , and he ($_shouto) braced for the pain 
 The surprise didn t end there . The flames swirled around Shouto ($_shouto) and jumped right between Shouto ($_shouto) and Enji ($_enji) before towering into a pillar that morphed into the shape of a person ; large and muscular with bangs that stood up like bunny ears . Slowly , though , the fiery gold figure morphed again into a skinny form that was almost skeletal , though just as tall and imposing . The blue of his eyes stood starkly against the gold of his whole body . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes snapped open . He ($_shouto) stared at the golden flames that circled him ($_shouto) harmlessly , curving around him ($_shouto) protectively not unlike the time it ($_shouto) did the same for Izuku ($_izuku) . Enji ($_enji) looked about as surprised as Shouto ($_shouto) was . 
 How even was he the fire Shouto ($_shouto) had been carrying around for the past whole day ? 
 All Might , Enji said , quietly , and Shouto ($_shouto) stared at the golden fire-person . This was All_Might ($_all) ? The very person Enji wanted him to surpass ? 
 Like you were about to do to your own son ? All_Might ($_all) s voice was deep and booming , sending a tremor up Shouto ($_shouto) s spine . Despite the golden flames that he ($_shouto) was , his ($_shouto) words sent chills along Shouto ($_shouto) s skin . 
 As soon as the gate was pushed , a bell trilled , high and melodious . The path that led to the house , which was illuminated by the soft glows of what seemed to be phantom lights blared to life , showing eight torches that burned with different colors each . For a moment , Shouto ($_shouto) thought he ($_shouto) saw them flicker and turn into spectral shapes of eight distinct people , but then the fire flickered again and they were flames once more . It was then that Shouto ($_shouto) realized that at the end of the torches were skulls , and the different colored flames burn steadily through the bones . How the bones seem perfectly pristine and untouched despite the constant heat was beyond Shouto ($_shouto) . 
 Skulls , though . Shouto ($_shouto) suppressed a shudder . 
 The trek through the woods took a whole day , and it was well past dusk when he ($_shouto) finally saw the glow of multicolored flames that seemed more otherworldly than anything . Shouto ($_shouto) stared at the glowing lights for a moment , steeled himself ($_shouto) , and strode forward purposefully , steps strong despite the fatigue that gnawed on his ($_shouto) bones . 
 The path soon lead him ($_shouto) to a wooden house that stood on four fowl legs -LRB- Shouto ($_shouto) paused , stared , and decided he ($_shouto) didn t want to think much about it -RRB- . He ($_shouto) went ahead to the gates that stood as a threshold between the house and the woods , staring at it with morbid marvel once he ($_shouto) realized it was made of bones and wood , and pushed it open . The gate felt odd , as if it was there and wasn t there at the same time . 
  -LRB- Also , he ($_shouto) might have made an error in decision , to go out before the sun even rises to avoid meeting Enji . Which ended up being a futile effort anyway , because Enji ($_enji) still caught him ($_shouto) on his ($_shouto) way out and grabbed his ($_shouto) arm while glaring sternly at him ($_shouto) , flame magic spiking into sparks in the air without actually lighting fire before letting go . Shouto ($_shouto) could still feel Enji ($_enji) s magic clinging onto him ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) doubted it would disappear anytime soon . -RRB- Soon , though , daylight broke through the dark horizon . Shouto couldn t help but sigh in relief , knowing he ($_shouto) wouldn t have to stumble around in the dark anymore . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) figured it was as good a guess as any , so he ($_shouto) braced himself ($_shouto) and walked into the forest . The tall trees stood imposingly , often blocking his ($_shouto) way , and Shouto ($_shouto) found he ($_shouto) hand to put a hand before him ($_shouto) to feel where the trees were . Shouto ($_shouto) walked carefully , avoiding stumbling on tree roots and mentally keeping track of his ($_shouto) path . 
 -LRB- He ($_shouto) knew he ($_shouto) would be lost soon enough , but he ($_shouto) could pretend . -RRB- 
 He ($_shouto) brought the doll whenever he ($_shouto) went and made sure no one would see the doll . He ($_shouto) never came to need to feed the doll , but he ($_shouto) kept it in his ($_shouto) pocket anyway . If it was to be the last thing his ($_shouto) mother ever gave to him ($_shouto) , then he ($_shouto) d want it as close to his ($_shouto) person as possible all the time . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) learned that he ($_shouto) was not , and would never be , free in the tender age of five . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) learned that he ($_shouto) was special in the tender age of five . 
 Anger bubbled in Shouto ($_shouto) s stomach . This again ? I ve told you , I want no part in this . You said I d be free if I bring you the light . Let me go already . 
 I m doing this for you , Shouto ($_shouto) Shouto_,_Enji ($_enji) said with a frown , and something in Shouto ($_shouto) snapped . 
 Why do you even want the light ? Shouto ($_shouto) asked . You have flame magic . I know you said it can t be extinguished , but it feels a bit too much . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) held out the torch for Enji ($_enji) to see . I got your light , he ($_shouto) said . 
 Enji s smiled widened . Perfect , he ($_shouto) said , standing up and taking the torch from Shouto ($_shouto) s hands . He ($_shouto) caressed the golden flames , his ($_shouto) own magic protecting him ($_shouto) from the scalding heat . 
 It took him ($_shouto) another full day of walking , but eventually he ($_shouto) reached the edge of the forest by nightfall . It was close to his ($_shouto) house , so quickly made his ($_shouto) way back . The golden torch provided the light that he ($_shouto) needed to see his ($_shouto) way , and soon he ($_shouto) had found himself ($_shouto) in his ($_shouto) doorsteps . He ($_shouto) pushed the door open and strode inside , torch in hand . 
 No , you re doing this for yourself , Shouto ($_shouto) growled . You see me as nothing but a tool . If you want to surpass All_Might ($_all) , do it ($_all) yourself . Take that inextinguishable properties for yourself . I don t care about your goals . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) stepped back into the house and closed the door , hand hovering by his ($_shouto) pocket . After a moment , he ($_shouto) dug into it and took out the wooden doll his ($_shouto) mother gave him ($_shouto) . It looked the same as usual ; parted red lips , closed eyes , hair as white as freshly fallen snow . 
 Meaningfully , Midoriya ($_midoriya) s gaze landed on Shouto ($_shouto) s pocket . A parent s blessing counts as help , you know . I won t mind it . With that , green lightning sparked off his skin , and he jumped to the air and disappeared into the night sky . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked . What do you mean ? 
  The curly-haired boy stood and walked to the door , and Shouto ($_shouto) followed . He took the clothed basket still rattling , but stilled once Midoriya ($_midoriya) balanced it on his hip . Everything you ll need is inside the hut . Good luck doing your task . And I have some leftover from dinner , if you want to eat . I m sure you re hungry , after walking around in the forest for so long . He turned and paused , then met Shouto ($_shouto) s eyes . By the way you do realize that it s okay if you don t do all of those tasks alone , right ? It s okay to get help . Yes , Shouto answered without putting much thought into it . He glanced around the room again . Sacks leaned by the walls , filled to the seams some with grain and some with seeds . There were more sacks than Shouto ($_shouto) would ve hoped , and suddenly he wondered if he would be able to finish his task by the morning . 
 To his ($_shouto) surprise , it began to eat . It bit into the bread and chewed , and in his ($_shouto) fascination Shouto ($_shouto) found himself ($_shouto) feeding the doll more . After a moment , the doll s eyes opened , revealing a pair of painted brown irises . Shouto ($_shouto) took a deep , sharp breath , staring at it . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) turned to the dining table . Like Midoriya_had_told_him ($_midoriya) him ($_shouto) , there was some leftover food a bit of rice , some meat , and bread that had started to harden but was still perfectly fine to eat . Shouto ($_shouto) reached for the bread and tore a piece , putting it near the doll s mouth . 
 

($_i)	 Um. Todoroki . Shouto ($_shouto) blinked at the slightly shorter boy Midoriya ($_midoriya) . I_m ($_i) sorry , but I don t think I heard you correctly . You re Baba_Yaga ($_baba) ? My ($_i) house burned down , Shouto ($_shouto) explained . I ($_i) have nowhere to go . I ($_i) was wondering if I ($_i) could stay here . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) smiled at him ($_izuku) softly , which reminded Shouto ($_shouto) of the full moon still shining above their heads ; gentle but radiant , with the stars sprinkling the dark sky and wisps of cloud drifting by , never enough to choke away the moon s glow . Hello , Shouto ($_shouto) , he ($_izuku) greeted . I ($_i) didn t think I ($_i) d meet you again so soon . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) blinked . His ($_shouto) mother did say it was a magic spell , so he ($_shouto) probably shouldn t be so surprised . There was something about the doll s voice , though . Something familiar that he ($_shouto) couldn t quite place . I ($_i) , um . Father told me ($_i) to ask for light from Baba_Yaga ($_baba) . 
 Don ($_don) t worry , Shouto , the doll said . I ($_i) ll help you ($_don) . Open up my ($_i) husks until the smallest doll is out . Each of my ($_i) husks will be able to help with your ($_don) tasks . 
 Baba_Yaga ($_baba) told me ($_i) that if I ($_i) want to take the light , I ($_i) need to sort his grains , clean the poppy seeds , and cook his meal . There are a lot . Of his grains and seeds . I ($_i) don t think I ($_i) d be able to do it by myself ($_i) . 
  Some herbs hung by the window to dry , some sprinkled down the floor . I m , uh . I_m ($_i) here to bring light from you . I ($_i) ll be fine with grains and poppy seed , Shouto ($_shouto) responded . He ($_shouto) walked to Izuku and crouched down beside him ($_shouto) . 
 When Enji ($_enji) s training became even harsher , when his ($_enji) punishment piled harder , when meals became rationed not because they were having economic difficulties but because Shouto ($_shouto) refused to do as Enji ($_enji) said , Shouto ($_shouto) couldn t take it anymore . He ($_enji) spoke , loud and clear , I want to stop . I_m ($_i) not you creation . I_m ($_i) not a tool . Let me go . 
 

($_all)	What has clued me in is enough , All_Might ($_all) responded . What sort of parent burns his ($_enji) own son ? 
 Izuku ($_izuku) was there , kneeling on the ground tending to his ($_izuku) plants , All Might right by his ($_izuku) side . The two of them turned to look at Shouto ($_shouto) . All_Might ($_all) smiled and returned to his ($_izuku) golden fire form , which then resided on the skull torch . How it ($_all) returned there was beyond Shouto ($_shouto) , but he ($_izuku) decided he ($_izuku) didn t need to think much about it ($_all) . 
 All_Might ($_all) s response was quick . Yes. 
 Enji ($_enji) remained silent . He ($_enji) narrowed his ($_enji) eyes on All_Might ($_all) . 
 All_Might ($_all) looked more sad and tired than anything , hearing Enji ($_enji) s response . I see , he ($_enji) said . Then I presume you have no plans to dispel it ? 
 You ve harmed your child in your misguided quest for power , All_Might ($_all) said as he ($_enji) turned back to Enji . You aim to harm my successor . You have harmed him ($_enji) through the spell you put on your son when you sent him ($_enji) away , and that spell lingers still on him ($_enji) even now and will spark and harm more people at a moment s notice . He ($_enji) paused . Why do you even place such curse-like spell on him ($_enji) ? 
 Enji s words gave chills and heat both that spread throughout Shouto ($_shouto) s body . He ($_enji) didn t want to fight Izuku . He ($_enji) refused to fight him ($_enji) . When All_Might ($_all) turned his ($_enji) eyes at him ($_enji) in inquiry , Shouto ($_shouto) shook his ($_shouto) head almost desperately . 
 Something within Shouto ($_shouto) tingled . He ($_enji) could sense All_Might ($_all) s magic bubbling to the surface , a raw magic that came from his ($_enji) nature as a soulfire and not from his ($_enji) self . He ($_enji) knew what would happen before it ($_all) did , and turned and covered his ($_enji) eyes just in time to avoid being blinded by a supernova . 
 He ($_enji) s made ? All_Might ($_all) repeated , disgust and contempt in his ($_enji) voice . He ($_enji) s your child . 
  There was a flash of gold as someone looped his arm around his torso and dragged him out of the house . He escaped having the roof caving in on his head by a hair s breadth . All_Might ($_all) gently stood him up , but all strength left his legs as he watched his house crumbling . It was no more than a pile of burnt charcoal and broken glass by the time the dust settled . Shouto ($_shouto) stared wordlessly at it as he ($_shouto) felt the dirt under his ($_shouto) hand . It was strangely grounding , something to hold onto that didn t make him ($_shouto) feel like he ($_shouto) was floating . It was something to counter the ringing in his ($_shouto) ears that made him ($_shouto) wonder if any of this was real , since he ($_shouto) couldn t even hear the house crumbling . Shouto ($_shouto) blinked at him ($_shouto) , unable to string words to respond . All_Might ($_all) smiled that sad , apologetic smile at him ($_shouto) and pulled him ($_shouto) into a hug . The ringing in Shouto ($_shouto) s ears slowly disappeared , and warmth seeped to his ($_shouto) skin . He ($_shouto) wasn t even aware that he ($_shouto) was cold . Hesitantly , Shouto ($_shouto) returned the hug . 
 He ($_shouto) looked at the golden figure of All_Might ($_all) , who was returning to his ($_shouto) skeletal form all while staring at him ($_shouto) apologetically as he ($_shouto) got to his ($_shouto) knees . I m sorry for this , he ($_shouto) said , and it was odd that Shouto ($_shouto) could hear his ($_shouto) words clearly through the ringing in his ($_shouto) ears . I can t think of any other way to stop him ($_shouto) . A man like Todoroki Enji can not be reasoned with . 
  No one will surpass me , All_Might ($_all) spoke up , then , but the words weren t said haughtily . There was no hint of arrogance in his ($_enji) tone . All Might , Enji said , quietly , and Shouto ($_shouto) stared at the golden fire-person . This was All_Might ($_all) ? The very person Enji wanted him to surpass ? 
 Like you were about to do to your own son ? All_Might ($_all) s voice was deep and booming , sending a tremor up Shouto ($_shouto) s spine . Despite the golden flames that he ($_shouto) was , his ($_shouto) words sent chills along Shouto ($_shouto) s skin . 
 This is so you will be stronger , Enji ($_enji) replied . I know of a spell to take an element s attribute as your own . You will take this fire s inextinguishable properties . You will be the strongest mage to ever live , and you will surpass All_Might ($_all) . 
 No , you re doing this for yourself , Shouto ($_shouto) growled . You see me as nothing but a tool . If you want to surpass All_Might ($_all) , do it ($_all) yourself . Take that inextinguishable properties for yourself . I don t care about your goals . 
 

($_todoroki)	There was silence for a moment before Midoriya ($_midoriya) broke it . It s been nice , Todoroki ($_todoroki) . I wish you ($_don) a safe travel . 
 Todoroki ($_todoroki) stared . You would ve given the light out for free ? 
 It wasn t easy , for sure , Todoroki ($_todoroki) admitted . I might have been in trouble if not for the help I had . 
 That was a good meal , Midoriya ($_midoriya) said once he ($_midoriya) finished his ($_midoriya) food . I haven t eaten something that good in a while . Thank you , Todoroki ($_todoroki) .
