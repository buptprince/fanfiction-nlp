($_kirishima)	 It s better you go , and tell the kingdom , than I do and they come chasing me . Kirishima ($_kirishima) said to Eri , placing her ($_kirishima) on the ground .  He ($_kirishima) knelt to her ($_kirishima) level and kissed her ($_kirishima) forehead . Take the blessing of the_Elder_Fire_Guardian ($_the) and go help the last of our ($_the) kind . Be safe , Eri ($_eri) . He ($_kirishima) said . Now go! The little dragonborn nodded and ran off into the forest , taking one last look at the dragon who helped her ($_kirishima) , only to see him ($_kirishima) getting attacked and lose conscious from the weaken spell by Overhaul s men . The young dragon turned back around and disappeared into the forest , under the cover of night to go gain help for her ($_kirishima) brother . When Kirishima ($_kirishima) woke up again , he ($_kirishima) heard the door to his ($_kirishima) caravan open and a second body being thrown in . 
  Have fun with the dragon , kid . You said you wanted to see it . He ($_kirishima) heard someone say before he ($_kirishima) was in darkness once again . The_child ($_kirishima) , he ($_kirishima) assumed it was female because of her scent , scrambled into a more comfortable position and pulled off his ($_kirishima) blindfold . Red eyes met crimson , staring at each other in awe . Kirishima ($_kirishima) noticed the girl had red eyes as well as white hair and a single horn on the right side of her forehead . Her hands were tied together , like his , but she could move them around . The white haired girl crawled closer to him and undid his gag . Eijirou room a deep breath and coughed for a while , before speaking , his voice hoarse .  Once his hands were free , he hugged her . He let her go again and undid the ropes on her hands , so that she could undo the ropes on his wings . Nightfall came and Kirishima ($_kirishima) and Eri ($_eri) , who s name he found out later , after a bit of chatter between them , snuck out of the caravan . It was fairly late into the night , every one of the hunters were asleep .  I 'm like you . I want to help you . We 're close to Yuuei . If I can get you free , we can make it there by the next morning if we leave tonight . She whispered , already undoing the knots on his hands . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was speechless . This young dragonborn was helping him even though they 've only known each other for a few minutes . Stop . Do you smell that ? Eri ($_eri) asked Kiri in draconic . Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped and smelt the air . Hunters . 
  Alright . Do you know which way to go ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) asked the younger dragonborn . She nodded and pointed east . Kirishima ($_kirishima) nodded , picked up and ran into the surrounding forest , eastward . A few times , the red headed dragon looked back behind them , to make sure that they weren t being followed as the duo traveled towards the safe kingdom of Yuuei , home to the great warrior , All Might . 

($_the)	The_next_time_Kirishima ($_the) woke up , he ($_the) was back in the caravan of the hunters . He ($_the) internally groaned feeling the ropes back on , though much tighter and much more painful than before . 
  He ($_kirishima) knelt to her ($_kirishima) level and kissed her ($_kirishima) forehead . Take the blessing of the_Elder_Fire_Guardian ($_the) and go help the last of our ($_the) kind . Be safe , Eri ($_eri) . He ($_kirishima) said . Now go! The little dragonborn nodded and ran off into the forest , taking one last look at the dragon who helped her ($_kirishima) , only to see him ($_kirishima) getting attacked and lose conscious from the weaken spell by Overhaul s men . The young dragon turned back around and disappeared into the forest , under the cover of night to go gain help for her ($_kirishima) brother . At least Eri ($_eri) is safe was his ($_the) last thought before passing out from the cold . The caster of the cold spell , who was hidden on the opposite end , walked out of the caravan and closed the door . 
 Geez , these are painful He ($_the) thought , as he ($_the) used his ($_the) tail to try and test how tight these knots were this time . He ($_the) also noticed that the temperature in the caravan dropped drastically and he ($_the) could feel his ($_the) strength waning . Fuck . Ice magic ? Not good. He ($_the) thought , moving himself ($_the) towards the back of the caravan and up against the wall , on his ($_the) side . At this rate , I ll pass out , or worse , die . He ($_the) thought as his ($_the) consciousness started to slip away from him ($_the) . 
  Get ready to move. We need to pass the Demon s Graveyard tonight , otherwise the King will catch up to us . Also , once we 're through , encase him ($_the) in ice .  He ($_the) 's caused to many problems .  I do n't care if he ($_the) dies , all I want out of him ($_the) are his ($_the) scales , wings , and horns . The rest of him ($_the) is useless . Overhaul said . The_mage_hunter ($_the) nodded and started sending out the commands to the rest of the hunters , going back to check on their prize . He ($_the) woke up for a bit before the effects of the spell took over . He ($_the) s out cold now . They said to the leader , Overhaul . He ($_the) nodded and glared at the mountain terrain they needed to pass . 
 

($_eri)	 He ($_kirishima) knelt to her ($_kirishima) level and kissed her ($_kirishima) forehead . Take the blessing of the_Elder_Fire_Guardian ($_the) and go help the last of our ($_the) kind .

Hunters . 
 When I say to , run as fast as you can to the kingdom . I ll hold them off . The older dragon said to the memory dragon . Eri ($_eri) shook her ($_eri) head and held onto him ($_eri) tighter .
