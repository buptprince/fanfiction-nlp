($_momo)	We ll be fine , Momo ($_momo) ! Ochako ($_ochako) calls . You stay safe ! 
 The path they walk is mountainous - Momo ($_momo) informs them that this is the highest peak in the entirety of the country , despite it being an anomaly - it s not in any mountain range . Shoto ($_shoto) adds that the crown city was built behind it for a reason ; it acts as a last line of defence for any potential attackers . Those words seem even more potent now given the situation . Perhaps that is what King Enji is so scared of . 
  What do you want to do ? It s not safe enough for you to cross ! Momo ($_momo) cries . She has a point . The wall of mud is still wet - it d take a miracle for them to get over . They re enclosed in with no way around - to their right is the solid wall of the mountain , and to their right is a cliff like drop .  It rains heavily for the next few days . Summer storms , Shoto ($_shoto) calls it , and Momo ($_momo) backs him ($_shoto) up . There s a lot of caves along here , apparently . They re marked on Momo ($_momo) s map , though she doesn t dare bring it out just to watch the ink run and ruin the carefully drawn lines put in place by a master map maker . She s had the map as long as she remembers , and isn t about to lose it now just because Katsuki ($_katsuki) is getting impatient . 
 

($_katsuki)	She ($_katsuki) has a point , she ($_katsuki) can hear Shoto say , barely audible . 
 Ochako_Uraraka ($_uraraka) , she ($_uraraka) sighs , smiling despite her ($_uraraka) annoyance with Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
 Tokoyami can lift you both over on Dark Shadow , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , gesturing to the bird on the mudslide . Its ($_kirishima) rider nods mutely , and guides the bird to the ground . Ochako ($_ochako) hops on first , and as the bird takes off she ($_uraraka) s sure she ($_uraraka) pulls out a few feathers because she ($_uraraka) s holding on so tight . Katsuki ($_katsuki) arrives a minute after herself ($_uraraka) , and then Kirishima ($_kirishima) , who shakes Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand once more . The red haired man whispers something in his ($_katsuki) ear , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares at him ($_katsuki) , gritting his ($_katsuki) teeth as he ($_katsuki) turns away . 
 What was that about ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks him ($_katsuki) as they walk on . She ($_uraraka) pulls the map out of her ($_uraraka) pouch , trying to figure out the best path to the town they were supposed to meet up with everyone else at . 
  I guess it s been a long time since we ve eaten , huh ? She ($_ochako) says with a smile , picking at the hem of her ($_ochako) skirt . He ($_katsuki) rummages around behind him ($_katsuki) , and pulls out a bag . Ochako ($_ochako) s eyes light up - she ($_ochako) hadn t even noticed he ($_katsuki) was carrying anything .  Katsuki ($_katsuki) grumbles slightly as he ($_katsuki) hands across a roll of bread , Ochako ($_ochako) taking it with great enthusiasm . He ($_katsuki) pulls out a flask too , and while depleted , it ll be enough to get them through the_night ($_the) . They eat in silence , and one all the crumbs are gone , Ochako ($_ochako) scoots round to sit beside Katsuki ($_katsuki) . Release ! She ($_ochako) says , lowering her ($_ochako) staff , watching him ($_katsuki) fall to the floor with no remorse . 
 Put me down ! He ($_katsuki) shouts , clearly ignoring her ($_ochako) request for him ($_katsuki) to stop yelling . I m fucking serious ! 
  She ($_ochako) sits by the fire , ignoring his ($_katsuki) outbursts , and eventually he ($_katsuki) sits too , opposite her ($_ochako) , feet warming by the steadily growing fire . He ($_katsuki) stares into the flames , avoiding all eye contact with her ($_ochako) . Yet she ($_ochako) watches him ($_katsuki) . His ($_katsuki) face is a lot smoother when it s not twisted into a scowl , all lines of anger gone .  The firelight casts a strange flickering glow over his ($_katsuki) face , accenting his ($_katsuki) strong features , and Ochako ($_ochako) has to wrench her ($_ochako) gaze away from him ($_katsuki) in case he ($_katsuki) notices her ($_ochako) staring . Once she ($_ochako) turns her ($_ochako) attention to poking the fire it s his ($_katsuki) turn to admire her ($_ochako) - not that he ($_katsuki) was doing that at all . Her ($_ochako) chocolate eyes are warmer in the dim light , and despite her ($_ochako) hair being damp from the rain it s somehow sitting nicely , framing her ($_ochako) face . She ($_ochako) bites down on her ($_ochako) lip as if she ($_ochako) s concentrating on a troubling thought , and it s then that his ($_katsuki) stomach rumbles . What the fu - He ($_katsuki) starts , but she ($_ochako) holds her ($_ochako) staff up again and he ($_katsuki) immediately closes his ($_katsuki) mouth . 
 Fuck off! He ($_katsuki) repeats , angrier this time . 
  Shut the fuck up , Ochako ($_ochako) ! He ($_katsuki) yells , and she ($_ochako) smiles smugly , as making him ($_katsuki) lose his ($_katsuki) temper . As he ($_katsuki) speaks , there s an explosion in one palm , and the stick he ($_katsuki) was holding lights on fire . He ($_katsuki) drops it on the fire with a huff , before turning on the brunette , another explosion crackling in his ($_katsuki) hand . He ($_katsuki) aims it at her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) s prepared , and sidesteps the brunt of the blast , grabbing her ($_ochako) staff in the middle of the movement and casting the floating spell on him ($_katsuki) again . Will you damn extras stop talking about me as if I m not right here ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) yells , effectively shutting them up . 
  He hasn t awoken yet - he s probably used to the beast moving about since they ve been together for so many years . She ($_ochako) manages to prise her ($_ochako) way out from under him without him waking up , making her ($_ochako) way outside to wash herself ($_ochako) . The water was slightly stagnant - just rainwater that had gathered in puddles - but it was better than smelling for the rest of the day . When she ($_ochako) returns to the cave , having to float herself ($_ochako) up once more , Katsuki ($_katsuki) is already awake , beginning to pack their things up . Lord Explosion Murder flies out , leaving the two alone . Ochako ($_ochako) puts her ($_ochako) cape on - it ($_ochako) s dry now , thankfully . Is it ($_ochako) raining ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks gruffly . 
 As they exit the cave , Katsuki ($_katsuki) clambers down the cliff face without much of a problem . Ochako ($_ochako) stands atop , not wanting to use her ($_ochako) magic power this early in the morning , and certainly not on an empty stomach . Katsuki ($_katsuki) stares up at her ($_ochako) , and feeling uncomfortable , she ($_ochako) pulls at the hem of her ($_ochako) skirt . 
  Ooh , who is this ? One girl calls to the red haired man . Her ($_ochako) hair is pink , and her ($_ochako) skin oddly seems to match . With her ($_ochako) are another two girls - one with dark hair and one that resembles a frog . Another two people arrive behind them - two boys , one of which has a shock of blond hair brighter than Katsuki ($_katsuki) s , and another with a perplexed expression . Sounds like someone else I ($_i) know , Ochako ($_ochako) jokes , but unsurprisingly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) doesn t find it funny . 
 I d recognise that voice anywhere ! The voice comes . It s clearly male , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) perks up - he knows the person , Ochako ($_ochako) realises , and she ($_ochako) relaxes . 
  Katsuki ($_katsuki) relaxes too , rolling his ($_katsuki) eyes in defeat . A huge bird lands atop the wall of mud , and one of two riders atop the raven slides down the mud , clearly not caring about getting dirty . The young man , with bright red hair , grins at Katsuki ($_katsuki) , offering his hand for him to shake . The blond takes it , and as he does , more people appear from behind the horse . It looks to Ochako like a gang , and she ($_ochako) has to pray that Katsuki ($_katsuki) hasn t intentionally led her ($_ochako) here so they can steal what little belongings she ($_ochako) has . A sound of horse hooves from behind them makes them turn around in surprise - perhaps Tenya and Momo had come to their rescue by finding another way around ? But of course , their luck had run out long ago , and a short man stares at them . His eyes widen with delight when he gets a good look at Ochako ($_ochako) , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) defensively steps in front of her ($_katsuki) , one hand on his axe . 
  She ($_ochako) pulls her ($_ochako) staff out from under the layers of her ($_ochako) cloak , holding it out in front of her ($_ochako) , pointed at Katsuki ($_katsuki) . She ($_ochako) mumbles an incantation , and then with a glowing blue light from the staff , Katsuki ($_katsuki) is lifted a few feet into the air . He ($_katsuki) stutters in shock - as if he ($_katsuki) wasn t convinced she ($_ochako) could actually do it . She ($_ochako) steers him ($_katsuki) into the gap of the cave , and once his ($_katsuki) feet disappear into the cave and he ($_katsuki) yells that it s all good , she ($_ochako) releases the spell that keeps him ($_katsuki) floating . She ($_ochako) takes a deep breath , trying to steady the nauseous feeling that has settled in her ($_ochako) stomach . Katsuki ($_katsuki) puts his ($_katsuki) head out the cave entrance , his ($_katsuki) face a mixture of anger and awe . I was trying to figure out how to make us not die , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says bluntly . 
 Bullshit , he ($_katsuki) says , but doesn t move . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) ! 
  I ll jump , she nods , voice small , nervous . He holds his arms out as she does so , landing in his arms just as she d aimed to . He ungraciously tips her onto her feet , and walks away in a huff . Ochako ($_ochako) swears the tips of his ($_ochako) ears are reddened , but she decides not to comment on it . They walk in silence , not that she can complain about that - it s too early in the morning for conversation . She s never been a morning person , and as far as she can tell from her limited experience , neither is Katsuki ($_katsuki) . It s only when they reach the mudslide almost an hour later that they speak again . And then a fifth , with mud sliding down the sheer side of the tallest mountain in the country , the speed picking up as it travels further downhill . Ochako ($_ochako) is stuck to the spot , and to save her ($_ochako) ass from getting swept away , Katsuki ($_katsuki) reaches out t grab her ($_ochako) , pulling her ($_ochako) out of the path of the mud . The mud , now with boulders and parts of trees and what looks almost like a small house in it continues to slide down the mountain until more than half an hour later it stops , in a huge pile splitting Katsuki and Ochako ($_ochako) from the rest of the group . The sound of the landslide was too loud for the two groups to communicate , but now that it s stopped -LRB- or at least slowed -RRB- , the two can yell at each other . 
 Shut the fuck up Deku , of course we re fine ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) yells , before turning back to Ochako . You are okay , right ? 
 Can t you use magic ? Can you get us over there ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) suggests , but she ($_katsuki) vehemently shakes her ($_katsuki) head . 
 Why don t you four go on ahead and find shelter ? She ($_katsuki) suggests . We can backtrack for a bit and see what we can find ! 
 He s a Wyvern , four eyes ! And I have no idea where he is ! He took off a while ago ; he s probably up the mountain somewhere ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) hollers back , and Ochako ($_ochako) can only sigh , taking matters into her ($_katsuki) own hands . 
 We re not friends , Katsuki ($_katsuki) mutters through gritted teeth . Kirishima ($_kirishima) and his ($_kirishima) idiots are more like acquaintances . 
 Fuck off , he ($_katsuki) answers , his ($_katsuki) voice gruff . Ochako ($_ochako) could tell he ($_katsuki) was hiding something - a slip of the tongue perhaps . 
 Did you mean something else ? She ($_ochako) smiles , kneeling beside him ($_katsuki) as he ($_katsuki) angrily rubs the sticks together in a vain attempt to light the fire . 
 I meant with the sticks , she ($_ochako) points out , narrowing her ($_ochako) eyes at him ($_katsuki) . He ($_katsuki) averts his ($_katsuki) gaze and gets to work . 
 Can you light the fire ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks when Katsuki ($_katsuki) decides he ($_katsuki) s dry enough and has turned back to her ($_ochako) . 
 Ochako ($_ochako) casts a tiny spell on herself ($_ochako) to make herself ($_ochako) weightless - the simplest of gravity spells , she ($_ochako) has discovered . Katsuki ($_katsuki) holds a hand out to her ($_ochako) , and she ($_ochako) gets a grip on the face of the mountain and pulls herself ($_ochako) up a little until she ($_ochako) can grab his hand and he pulls her ($_ochako) into the cave . To her ($_ochako) delight , she ($_ochako) finds that the cave is reasonably sizeable - large enough for the both of them plus Lord Explosion Murder , should he return . In the centre of the cave lies the remains of someone else s fire , thankfully dry . This was one thing Ochako ($_ochako) was worried about - it would be cold tonight , as there was no hope of finding any dry wood . But as she ($_ochako) holds her ($_ochako) hands over it , she ($_ochako) s delighted to find that it s still smouldering - someone had been here just before them . 
 There s a lot of caves along here , apparently . They re marked on Momo ($_momo) s map , though she doesn t dare bring it out just to watch the ink run and ruin the carefully drawn lines put in place by a master map maker . She s had the map as long as she remembers , and isn t about to lose it now just because Katsuki ($_katsuki) is getting impatient . 
 He s warm , Katsuki ($_katsuki) points out , staring intently at Ochako ($_ochako) . 
 At that , there s a loud sound from outside , almost reminiscent of lightning striking a tree , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) is immediately on his ($_katsuki) feet , looking out the cave entrance . With a grin on his ($_katsuki) face he ($_katsuki) guides in Lord Explosion Murder , who makes himself ($_katsuki) comfy on the stone floor . The wyvern curls itself round with what Ochako ($_ochako) can only describe as a smug expression . She ($_ochako) never thought she ($_ochako) would meet one of these supposedly extinct reptilian creatures , but as she ($_ochako) pats its nose , it exhales warm breath onto her ($_ochako) skin and she ($_ochako) can t help but smile . While he looks scary , he s essentially like a giant cat . 
 Goodnight , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , she ($_ochako) offers , not expecting an answer . 
 And she ($_ochako) does just that , grabbing her ($_ochako) cloak to use as a blanket . The underside of Lord Explosion Murder s belly is soft , devoid of scales , and she ($_ochako) can easily rest her ($_ochako) head against it . To her ($_ochako) surprise , Katsuki ($_katsuki) settles himself ($_katsuki) beside her ($_ochako) , his ($_katsuki) own cape wrapped around his ($_katsuki) shoulders again . She ($_ochako) smiles tiredly at him ($_katsuki) , and rather than glaring back at her ($_ochako) , he ($_katsuki) does a sort of grimace , before closing his ($_katsuki) eyes , head resting against Lord Explosion Murder . The wyvern gives a tired grunt too , clearly what the two do to communicate that it s time to sleep . 
 

($_izuku)	No ! He ($_izuku) snaps . That s not what he ($_izuku) meant . 
 Anyway , Bakugo , who s this ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins , raising his ($_izuku) eyebrows at the brown haired girl by his ($_izuku) side . 
 You were run out of your city ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , confused . Izuku ($_izuku) had told her that he ($_izuku) was exiled , but run out seems to imply something else . 
  Shoto ($_shoto) is right , they realise . The temperatures are rising . Summer is swiftly coming to an end , but the heat only continues to bear down , muffled slightly by the cloud cover . Not only is it raining , but the winds have picked up in the last few hours as well . Ochako ($_ochako) has suggested multiple times that they take a break , find some shelter and wait out the worst of it . But Shoto and Izuku ($_izuku) are determined to reach the crown city , disregarding the words of anyone else .  A rumble comes from the side of the cliff . Izuku ($_izuku) says to ignore it and continues on . Ochako ($_ochako) is left to wonder if perhaps the mountain is actually a volcano - that would make a lot of sense to her . Her train of thought is quickly cut off by the two natives of the Northern Kingdom , who confirm that the mountain is , in fact , just a mountain . Ochako ($_ochako) pouts a little at this - her ($_ochako) theory was much cooler , she ($_ochako) thinks . Are you two okay ? Izuku ($_izuku) calls first , his ($_izuku) voice sounding surprisingly far away . 
 

($_shoto)	The path they walk is mountainous - Momo ($_momo) informs them that this is the highest peak in the entirety of the country , despite it being an anomaly - it s not in any mountain range . Shoto ($_shoto) adds that the crown city was built behind it for a reason ; it acts as a last line of defence for any potential attackers . Those words seem even more potent now given the situation . Perhaps that is what King Enji is so scared of . 
  Shoto ($_shoto) is right , they realise . The temperatures are rising . Summer is swiftly coming to an end , but the heat only continues to bear down , muffled slightly by the cloud cover .

Ochako ($_ochako) has suggested multiple times that they take a break , find some shelter and wait out the worst of it . But Shoto and Izuku ($_izuku) are determined to reach the crown city , disregarding the words of anyone else .  It rains heavily for the next few days . Summer storms , Shoto ($_shoto) calls it , and Momo ($_momo) backs him ($_shoto) up . 

($_the)	 Katsuki ($_katsuki) grumbles slightly as he ($_katsuki) hands across a roll of bread , Ochako ($_ochako) taking it with great enthusiasm . He ($_katsuki) pulls out a flask too , and while depleted , it ll be enough to get them through the_night ($_the) . They eat in silence , and one all the crumbs are gone , Ochako ($_ochako) scoots round to sit beside Katsuki ($_katsuki) . Don t yell at me , she ($_ochako) says calmly . We have to get along , since we re stuck together for the_night ($_the) . So please don t make this harder than it already is . 
  While the_Northern_Kingdom ($_the) is generally quite cool , the summer can get hot , but not until after the storms . They ($_the) both are prepared for the event , but no one else quite knows what to expect . It s been raining a lot recently anyway , an almost constant drizzle that dampens the mood . The push on under an ugly grey sky regardless , their goal almost visible now . So you can lean against him to sleep . I promise he won t move out from underneath you during the_night ($_the) . 
 

($_ochako)	We ll be fine , Momo ($_momo) ! Ochako ($_ochako) calls . You stay safe ! 
  They part ways then , Katsuki and Ochako ($_ochako) heading back south , retracing their steps . Ochako ($_ochako) is convinced that she ($_ochako) saw a cave not too far back , but she ($_ochako) wasn t sure where . It would be at least half an hour s walk back , if she ($_ochako) counted right . And half an hour walking side by side with Katsuki Bakugo wasn t something she ($_ochako) was exactly elated about . She ($_ochako) was exhausted anyway , and even he seemed to be tiring . Their feet drag along the path , and Ochako ($_ochako) suddenly remembers that they haven t stopped for dinner yet . It s not as late as she ($_ochako) originally thought - perhaps seven in the evening , but the storm clouds covering the sky makes it feel closer to midnight . There! She ($_ochako) calls suddenly , causing the blond to stop a little ways ahead and turn back to her ($_ochako) , the scowl on his face made less threatening by the water dripping down his face . 
 I really don t think that s safe ... Izuku s concern is practically palpable through the mud wall , but Ochako ($_ochako) is certain . 
 Tokoyami can lift you both over on Dark Shadow , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , gesturing to the bird on the mudslide . Its ($_kirishima) rider nods mutely , and guides the bird to the ground . Ochako ($_ochako) hops on first , and as the bird takes off she ($_uraraka) s sure she ($_uraraka) pulls out a few feathers because she ($_uraraka) s holding on so tight . Katsuki ($_katsuki) arrives a minute after herself ($_uraraka) , and then Kirishima ($_kirishima) , who shakes Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand once more . The red haired man whispers something in his ($_katsuki) ear , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares at him ($_katsuki) , gritting his ($_katsuki) teeth as he ($_katsuki) turns away . 
 What was that about ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks him ($_katsuki) as they walk on . She ($_uraraka) pulls the map out of her ($_uraraka) pouch , trying to figure out the best path to the town they were supposed to meet up with everyone else at . 
 You were run out of your city ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , confused . Izuku ($_izuku) had told her that he ($_izuku) was exiled , but run out seems to imply something else . 
  I guess it s been a long time since we ve eaten , huh ? She ($_ochako) says with a smile , picking at the hem of her ($_ochako) skirt . He ($_katsuki) rummages around behind him ($_katsuki) , and pulls out a bag . Ochako ($_ochako) s eyes light up - she ($_ochako) hadn t even noticed he ($_katsuki) was carrying anything .  Katsuki ($_katsuki) grumbles slightly as he ($_katsuki) hands across a roll of bread , Ochako ($_ochako) taking it with great enthusiasm . He ($_katsuki) pulls out a flask too , and while depleted , it ll be enough to get them through the_night ($_the) . They eat in silence , and one all the crumbs are gone , Ochako ($_ochako) scoots round to sit beside Katsuki ($_katsuki) . Release ! She ($_ochako) says , lowering her ($_ochako) staff , watching him ($_katsuki) fall to the floor with no remorse . 
 Put me down ! He ($_katsuki) shouts , clearly ignoring her ($_ochako) request for him ($_katsuki) to stop yelling . I m fucking serious ! 
  She ($_ochako) sits by the fire , ignoring his ($_katsuki) outbursts , and eventually he ($_katsuki) sits too , opposite her ($_ochako) , feet warming by the steadily growing fire . He ($_katsuki) stares into the flames , avoiding all eye contact with her ($_ochako) . Yet she ($_ochako) watches him ($_katsuki) . His ($_katsuki) face is a lot smoother when it s not twisted into a scowl , all lines of anger gone .

Once she ($_ochako) turns her ($_ochako) attention to poking the fire it s his ($_katsuki) turn to admire her ($_ochako) - not that he ($_katsuki) was doing that at all . Her ($_ochako) chocolate eyes are warmer in the dim light , and despite her ($_ochako) hair being damp from the rain it s somehow sitting nicely , framing her ($_ochako) face . She ($_ochako) bites down on her ($_ochako) lip as if she ($_ochako) s concentrating on a troubling thought , and it s then that his ($_katsuki) stomach rumbles . What the fu - He ($_katsuki) starts , but she ($_ochako) holds her ($_ochako) staff up again and he ($_katsuki) immediately closes his ($_katsuki) mouth . 
 Don t yell at me , she ($_ochako) says calmly . We have to get along , since we re stuck together for the_night ($_the) . So please don t make this harder than it already is . 
  Shut the fuck up , Ochako ($_ochako) ! He ($_katsuki) yells , and she ($_ochako) smiles smugly , as making him ($_katsuki) lose his ($_katsuki) temper . As he ($_katsuki) speaks , there s an explosion in one palm , and the stick he ($_katsuki) was holding lights on fire . He ($_katsuki) drops it on the fire with a huff , before turning on the brunette , another explosion crackling in his ($_katsuki) hand . He ($_katsuki) aims it at her ($_ochako) , but she ($_ochako) s prepared , and sidesteps the brunt of the blast , grabbing her ($_ochako) staff in the middle of the movement and casting the floating spell on him ($_katsuki) again . I thought you said you didn t do friends , Ochako ($_ochako) reminds quietly . 
 The explosions expert , he reminds her ($_ochako) , and her ($_ochako) eyes widen with surprise . 
 You don t have friends apart from us , she ($_ochako) points out , and he rolls his eyes . 
  He hasn t awoken yet - he s probably used to the beast moving about since they ve been together for so many years . She ($_ochako) manages to prise her ($_ochako) way out from under him without him waking up , making her ($_ochako) way outside to wash herself ($_ochako) . The water was slightly stagnant - just rainwater that had gathered in puddles - but it was better than smelling for the rest of the day . When she ($_ochako) returns to the cave , having to float herself ($_ochako) up once more , Katsuki ($_katsuki) is already awake , beginning to pack their things up . Lord Explosion Murder flies out , leaving the two alone . Ochako ($_ochako) puts her ($_ochako) cape on - it ($_ochako) s dry now , thankfully . Is it ($_ochako) raining ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asks gruffly . 
 Night , Ochako ($_ochako) . 
 It s only when Lord Explosion Murder squirms particularly violently that Ochako ($_ochako) wakes , sun streaming through the entrance to the cave to tell her ($_ochako) it s morning . In the daylight , she ($_ochako) can see that the cave is a lot bigger than she ($_ochako) originally thought - the firelight from last night didn t help the cave at all . She ($_ochako) s still not fully awake , and after she ($_ochako) blinks the sleep from her ($_ochako) eyes , she ($_ochako) realises that to her ($_ochako) horror , in her ($_ochako) sleep , her ($_ochako) head has fallen on to Katsuki s shoulder . She ($_ochako) doesn t know what s worse - that , or the fact that he has slumped sideways into her ($_ochako) , and his head is resting on her ($_ochako) own . 
 As they exit the cave , Katsuki ($_katsuki) clambers down the cliff face without much of a problem . Ochako ($_ochako) stands atop , not wanting to use her ($_ochako) magic power this early in the morning , and certainly not on an empty stomach . Katsuki ($_katsuki) stares up at her ($_ochako) , and feeling uncomfortable , she ($_ochako) pulls at the hem of her ($_ochako) skirt . 
 A second rumble comes a little further on the path , and this time Ochako ($_ochako) points out that maybe they should stop right now immediately in case something happens . But her ($_ochako) complaints go ignored under the sound of the wind , and they push on . 
  Ooh , who is this ? One girl calls to the red haired man . Her ($_ochako) hair is pink , and her ($_ochako) skin oddly seems to match . With her ($_ochako) are another two girls - one with dark hair and one that resembles a frog . Another two people arrive behind them - two boys , one of which has a shock of blond hair brighter than Katsuki ($_katsuki) s , and another with a perplexed expression .

  Katsuki ($_katsuki) relaxes too , rolling his ($_katsuki) eyes in defeat . A huge bird lands atop the wall of mud , and one of two riders atop the raven slides down the mud , clearly not caring about getting dirty . The young man , with bright red hair , grins at Katsuki ($_katsuki) , offering his hand for him to shake . The blond takes it , and as he does , more people appear from behind the horse . It looks to Ochako like a gang , and she ($_ochako) has to pray that Katsuki ($_katsuki) hasn t intentionally led her ($_ochako) here so they can steal what little belongings she ($_ochako) has . A sound of horse hooves from behind them makes them turn around in surprise - perhaps Tenya and Momo had come to their rescue by finding another way around ? But of course , their luck had run out long ago , and a short man stares at them . His eyes widen with delight when he gets a good look at Ochako ($_ochako) , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) defensively steps in front of her ($_katsuki) , one hand on his axe . 
  She ($_ochako) pulls her ($_ochako) staff out from under the layers of her ($_ochako) cloak , holding it out in front of her ($_ochako) , pointed at Katsuki ($_katsuki) . She ($_ochako) mumbles an incantation , and then with a glowing blue light from the staff , Katsuki ($_katsuki) is lifted a few feet into the air . He ($_katsuki) stutters in shock - as if he ($_katsuki) wasn t convinced she ($_ochako) could actually do it . She ($_ochako) steers him ($_katsuki) into the gap of the cave , and once his ($_katsuki) feet disappear into the cave and he ($_katsuki) yells that it s all good , she ($_ochako) releases the spell that keeps him ($_katsuki) floating . She ($_ochako) takes a deep breath , trying to steady the nauseous feeling that has settled in her ($_ochako) stomach . Katsuki ($_katsuki) puts his ($_katsuki) head out the cave entrance , his ($_katsuki) face a mixture of anger and awe . Wait, wait! I can get us up there with magic ! It s a short distance , so I can safely get you up , and then you can pull me up . By her ($_ochako) estimates , it was only eight feet in the air , and while there was no guarantee that the cave would be sizeable , it was better than nothing . 
 It s freezing , she ($_ochako) says bluntly . We need to stay close for warmth . 
 Hey , y know earlier ? She ($_ochako) starts , eager to ask a question that s been burning in her ($_ochako) mind for a while . 
 You did ! I know I heard you say it . Her ($_ochako) face lights up with glee , while his shoulders hunch , forming a protective shell around himself . 
 Then I will be glad , because that means we re friends . Her ($_ochako) grin almost wins him over when he turns to face her ($_ochako) , but he grits his teeth instead . 
  Shoto ($_shoto) is right , they realise . The temperatures are rising . Summer is swiftly coming to an end , but the heat only continues to bear down , muffled slightly by the cloud cover . Not only is it raining , but the winds have picked up in the last few hours as well . Ochako ($_ochako) has suggested multiple times that they take a break , find some shelter and wait out the worst of it . But Shoto and Izuku ($_izuku) are determined to reach the crown city , disregarding the words of anyone else .  A rumble comes from the side of the cliff . Izuku ($_izuku) says to ignore it and continues on . Ochako ($_ochako) is left to wonder if perhaps the mountain is actually a volcano - that would make a lot of sense to her . Her train of thought is quickly cut off by the two natives of the Northern Kingdom , who confirm that the mountain is , in fact , just a mountain . Ochako ($_ochako) pouts a little at this - her ($_ochako) theory was much cooler , she ($_ochako) thinks . He ($_ochako) doesn t fucking listen to me ($_i) . Never has. He ($_ochako) only sticks round with me ($_i) because I ($_i) feed him ($_ochako) . I m sure he ($_ochako) ll be cranky because I ($_i) couldn t feed him ($_ochako) this morning . 
 You could call Lord Explosion Murder , Ochako ($_ochako) suggests . He ($_ochako) could fly us over , no bother . 
 Not my fucking problem , then . Sticking his hands in his pockets , he begins to walk away . Ochako ($_ochako) calls after him , not wanting to be abandoned on the cliff edge . 
  I ll jump , she nods , voice small , nervous . He holds his arms out as she does so , landing in his arms just as she d aimed to . He ungraciously tips her onto her feet , and walks away in a huff . Ochako ($_ochako) swears the tips of his ($_ochako) ears are reddened , but she decides not to comment on it . They walk in silence , not that she can complain about that - it s too early in the morning for conversation . She s never been a morning person , and as far as she can tell from her limited experience , neither is Katsuki ($_katsuki) . It s only when they reach the mudslide almost an hour later that they speak again . And then a fifth , with mud sliding down the sheer side of the tallest mountain in the country , the speed picking up as it travels further downhill . Ochako ($_ochako) is stuck to the spot , and to save her ($_ochako) ass from getting swept away , Katsuki ($_katsuki) reaches out t grab her ($_ochako) , pulling her ($_ochako) out of the path of the mud . The mud , now with boulders and parts of trees and what looks almost like a small house in it continues to slide down the mountain until more than half an hour later it stops , in a huge pile splitting Katsuki and Ochako ($_ochako) from the rest of the group . The sound of the landslide was too loud for the two groups to communicate , but now that it s stopped -LRB- or at least slowed -RRB- , the two can yell at each other . 
 He s a Wyvern , four eyes ! And I have no idea where he is ! He took off a while ago ; he s probably up the mountain somewhere ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) hollers back , and Ochako ($_ochako) can only sigh , taking matters into her ($_katsuki) own hands . 
 Fuck off , he ($_katsuki) answers , his ($_katsuki) voice gruff . Ochako ($_ochako) could tell he ($_katsuki) was hiding something - a slip of the tongue perhaps . 
 Did you mean something else ? She ($_ochako) smiles , kneeling beside him ($_katsuki) as he ($_katsuki) angrily rubs the sticks together in a vain attempt to light the fire . 
 I meant with the sticks , she ($_ochako) points out , narrowing her ($_ochako) eyes at him ($_katsuki) . He ($_katsuki) averts his ($_katsuki) gaze and gets to work . 
  She ($_ochako) turns to Katsuki , who has removed his cape and is using it to dry his hair , to little avail . She ($_ochako) turns away quickly , because without his cape on his essentially half naked , and it s rude to stare at him . She ($_ochako) turns back again a few seconds later , complaining that he should offer her ($_ochako) the cape so she ($_ochako) can dry herself ($_ochako) first because she ($_ochako) s a lady , and he was a gentleman . He gives her ($_ochako) a rude finger gesture instead , not that she ($_ochako) should ve expected anything else . Her ($_ochako) bag of things is left on Iida s horse , along with a towel that she ($_ochako) could really use right about now . She ($_ochako) wrings the water out from her ($_ochako) skirt and removes her ($_ochako) own cloak , as well as the hood she ($_ochako) wears under it . She ($_ochako) never thought she ($_ochako) would miss that bag , but being without string to use as a makeshift clothesline causes a pang in her ($_ochako) stomach that she ($_ochako) pretends has nothing to do with homesickness . Can you light the fire ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks when Katsuki ($_katsuki) decides he ($_katsuki) s dry enough and has turned back to her ($_ochako) . 
 Ochako ($_ochako) casts a tiny spell on herself ($_ochako) to make herself ($_ochako) weightless - the simplest of gravity spells , she ($_ochako) has discovered . Katsuki ($_katsuki) holds a hand out to her ($_ochako) , and she ($_ochako) gets a grip on the face of the mountain and pulls herself ($_ochako) up a little until she ($_ochako) can grab his hand and he pulls her ($_ochako) into the cave . To her ($_ochako) delight , she ($_ochako) finds that the cave is reasonably sizeable - large enough for the both of them plus Lord Explosion Murder , should he return . In the centre of the cave lies the remains of someone else s fire , thankfully dry . This was one thing Ochako ($_ochako) was worried about - it would be cold tonight , as there was no hope of finding any dry wood . But as she ($_ochako) holds her ($_ochako) hands over it , she ($_ochako) s delighted to find that it s still smouldering - someone had been here just before them . 
 Right ... she ($_ochako) answers , prompting him to continue . 
 He s warm , Katsuki ($_katsuki) points out , staring intently at Ochako ($_ochako) . 
 At that , there s a loud sound from outside , almost reminiscent of lightning striking a tree , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) is immediately on his ($_katsuki) feet , looking out the cave entrance . With a grin on his ($_katsuki) face he ($_katsuki) guides in Lord Explosion Murder , who makes himself ($_katsuki) comfy on the stone floor . The wyvern curls itself round with what Ochako ($_ochako) can only describe as a smug expression . She ($_ochako) never thought she ($_ochako) would meet one of these supposedly extinct reptilian creatures , but as she ($_ochako) pats its nose , it exhales warm breath onto her ($_ochako) skin and she ($_ochako) can t help but smile . While he looks scary , he s essentially like a giant cat . 
 Wow , that stings , Ochako ($_ochako) says , feigning offence and putting a hand to her ($_ochako) heart . 
 Goodnight , Katsuki ($_katsuki) , she ($_ochako) offers , not expecting an answer . 
 And she ($_ochako) does just that , grabbing her ($_ochako) cloak to use as a blanket . The underside of Lord Explosion Murder s belly is soft , devoid of scales , and she ($_ochako) can easily rest her ($_ochako) head against it . To her ($_ochako) surprise , Katsuki ($_katsuki) settles himself ($_katsuki) beside her ($_ochako) , his ($_katsuki) own cape wrapped around his ($_katsuki) shoulders again . She ($_ochako) smiles tiredly at him ($_katsuki) , and rather than glaring back at her ($_ochako) , he ($_katsuki) does a sort of grimace , before closing his ($_katsuki) eyes , head resting against Lord Explosion Murder . The wyvern gives a tired grunt too , clearly what the two do to communicate that it s time to sleep . 
 

($_i)	Sounds like someone else I ($_i) know , Ochako ($_ochako) jokes , but unsurprisingly , Katsuki ($_katsuki) doesn t find it funny . 
 He ($_ochako) doesn t fucking listen to me ($_i) . Never has. He ($_ochako) only sticks round with me ($_i) because I ($_i) feed him ($_ochako) . I m sure he ($_ochako) ll be cranky because I ($_i) couldn t feed him ($_ochako) this morning . 
 I ($_i) don t want to . I ($_i) always get sick , and since I ($_i) haven t eaten anything yet today , I ($_i) have no energy . 
 

($_kirishima)	Anyway , Bakugo , who s this ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) grins , raising his ($_izuku) eyebrows at the brown haired girl by his ($_izuku) side . 
 Tokoyami can lift you both over on Dark Shadow , Kirishima ($_kirishima) says , gesturing to the bird on the mudslide . Its ($_kirishima) rider nods mutely , and guides the bird to the ground . Ochako ($_ochako) hops on first , and as the bird takes off she ($_uraraka) s sure she ($_uraraka) pulls out a few feathers because she ($_uraraka) s holding on so tight . Katsuki ($_katsuki) arrives a minute after herself ($_uraraka) , and then Kirishima ($_kirishima) , who shakes Kirishima ($_kirishima) s hand once more . The red haired man whispers something in his ($_katsuki) ear , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares at him ($_katsuki) , gritting his ($_katsuki) teeth as he ($_katsuki) turns away . 
 He ($_kirishima) told us if anything ever went down with the people who ran us out of our city he ($_kirishima) d help us , and that goes vice versa , the red haired man , Kirishima ($_kirishima) , Ochako assumes , explains . 
 We re not friends , Katsuki ($_katsuki) mutters through gritted teeth . Kirishima ($_kirishima) and his ($_kirishima) idiots are more like acquaintances . 
 

($_uraraka)	Ochako_Uraraka ($_uraraka) , she ($_uraraka) sighs , smiling despite her ($_uraraka) annoyance with Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
 We got separated from the rest of the group we re travelling with because of this mudslide , and we now have no way of meeting back up with them , she ($_uraraka) explains with a sheepish smile .

 What was that about ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks him ($_katsuki) as they walk on . She ($_uraraka) pulls the map out of her ($_uraraka) pouch , trying to figure out the best path to the town they were supposed to meet up with everyone else at .
