($_baby)	Some treated him ($_baby) like a symbol of the Gods ' love for humans , others of the monarch 's power , or as a sign that the reign of King Sho will be blessed with prosperity . 
 When baby_Sho ($_baby) is born , his ($_baby) mother 's eyes are met with the two colours she 'd grown to love . 
 His ($_baby) hair is red and white as the flower . In addition , her baby had inherited the kind blue eyes of her adored husband , the_king ($_the) . It was a blue that to her and many others , was the most beautiful colour in the world . 
 With mismatched eyes and smooth , asymmetrical hair , he ($_baby) is a beauty of the like the world had never seen before . For days , then weeks , then months the town was alight with celebration , for the very existence of the_Prince ($_the) made the island feel a thousand times wealthier than they had been before . 
 Soon after , the town gave up on their searches and prayers . The doors to the castles opened . It became old news that baby_Prince_Sho ($_baby) was gone . It became commonly accepted that he ($_baby) 'd never be found . 
 

($_'s)	He ($_'s) shook his ($_'s) head , not looking up . He ($_'s) feared what words his ($_'s) father could possibly say next . 
 `` To protect you . '' He ($_'s) felt his ($_'s) father 's chair sliding backwards from the vibrations of the table . He ($_'s) heard his ($_'s) single footstep towards him ($_'s) and sensed his ($_'s) presence kneeling right in front of him ($_'s) when a warm hand took his ($_'s) chin and tilted his ($_'s) face upwards . 
 Shouto_'s ($_'s) lip quivvered . Suddenly , his ($_'s) meal did n't taste so good , so he ($_'s) dropped his ($_'s) cutlery and hugged his ($_'s) arms around his ($_'s) stomach , head tilting downwards . 
 Over the years , Shouto_'s ($_'s) father ensured to visit him ($_'s) nearly every day of the week . Sometimes he ($_'s) was kind , and would bring gifts of books , foods and paints for his ($_'s) lonely child . Other times he ($_'s) would get straight to the point and force his ($_'s) son to push fire and ice out until he ($_'s) was exhausted , only to leave him ($_'s) half sweating half shivering on the floor and return to the outside world . 
 Watching the rise and fall of a cream coloured fur chest , the_teen ($_'s) had been delightedly mistaken into thinking it was a pet . 
 

($_the)	One story claimed the_King ($_the) and Queen ($_queen) had heard giggling from their ($_queen) sons room , and when they ($_queen) 'd entered had found a vast dome of ice crystals surrounding their ($_queen) baby . 
 His ($_baby) hair is red and white as the flower . In addition , her baby had inherited the kind blue eyes of her adored husband , the_king ($_the) . It was a blue that to her and many others , was the most beautiful colour in the world . 
 With mismatched eyes and smooth , asymmetrical hair , he ($_baby) is a beauty of the like the world had never seen before . For days , then weeks , then months the town was alight with celebration , for the very existence of the_Prince ($_the) made the island feel a thousand times wealthier than they had been before . 
 Whilst the_Queen ($_the) had been terrified , instantly checking all the bolts on all the windows for signs of intrusion , the_King ($_the) had just stood shocked in confusion , comically so as their ($_queen) son continued to chuckle , not disheartened in the slightest by their ($_queen) befuddlement . Rumours say it took them ($_queen) nearly an hour to realise that the ice had come from him . 
 Of course , the_man ($_the) knew how to rub wood together to ignite a flame . But he ($_the) reserved his ($_the) efforts , holding his ($_the) breath as the boy hopped down from his ($_the) armchair with a light thud , bringing his ($_the) short body beside him ($_the) and extending his ($_the) left palm ever so slightly . 
 The_man ($_the) grinned , walking over and placing his ($_the) hand over the entirety of the small head belonging to the child . 
 `` Hello father . '' The ten year old spoke . He ($_the) was a boy of very few expressions , though the emotions behind them were just as strong as any others ' . 
 It was n't sudden , but gradual like the descent of a sunset , until rumours spread like fire that the_Prince ($_the) was gone . Kidnapped ? Murdered? Died of a disease ... of the wounds from his mother 's violence or stranger 's attacks ? 
 The_King ($_the) became quiet . Prince_Sho ($_sho) was no longer brought into public , and for a long time , the only people that left the tower were tight lipped and frowning . 
 They say it began with the_Queen ($_the) - that she became jealous of her own child 's popularity and burnt him , scarring the body of what everyone considered a demi-god . It was believed that this cursed the land , terrifying even the King himself who made many desperate attempts at atonement , including banishing his own wife . 
 The boy himself ($_the) was hardly interested . 
 With a sigh , the_man ($_the) began to cook , preparing a meal rich with vegetables , meat and butter - delicacies no common folk could afford all together like this . 
 The_King ($_the) sighed , `` Exactly , so it would be better for both of us if you just ate your food . '' 
 To those close enough , whilst looking into the blue gaze of the_king ($_the) , they concluded that deep down , the_man ($_the) knew this tragic truth himself ($_the) but that not saying it out loud was the only thing keeping him ($_the) pushing forwards with life each day . 
 If anyone had suffered the most , it was him ($_the) and now he ($_the) had a darkness in his ($_the) gaze . He ($_the) did n't seem capable of empathising with the children of his ($_the) kingdom , only intent on searching - prosecuting every criminal he ($_the) could get his ($_the) hands on in hopes of one day being able to see the mismatched eyes of his ($_the) son again . 
 But the people did n't believe him ($_the) . 
 Like all else of the boys life , there was never any confirmation , only rumours . Even when the_King ($_the) had reemerged in the time of his ($_the) town 's need to aid them through the mourning process , he ($_the) remained tight lipped with black shadows under his ($_the) firm eyes . 
 He ($_the) had always been a kind , brave almost heroic leader , but the loss of his ($_the) wife and son had changed him ($_the) . 
 

($_shouto)	He ($_shouto) would kiss him ($_shouto) on his ($_shouto) cheeks , forehead and everywhere else until he ($_shouto) 'd forgotten all about his ($_shouto) pain . 
 Once upon a time , Shouto ($_shouto) used to love this . It ($_shouto) was the first time in his ($_shouto) life he ($_shouto) 'd felt any sort of physical affection . It was what his ($_shouto) touch starved , socially deprived self had always wanted and what he ($_shouto) 'd thought was okay as parental love . After all , mothers always kissed their children in stories . 
 That lasted until he ($_shouto) was fifteen at most , and then the reality of it came crushing down on him ($_shouto) harder than the grip around his ($_shouto) throat as the_man ($_shouto) he ($_shouto) called father became more and more severe with his ($_shouto) punishments . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) was n't sure when , but he ($_shouto) had long since stopped liking it . He ($_shouto) started to hate his ($_shouto) father right back , but inevitably still gave in and loved the only man in the world he ($_shouto) knew with a heart full of space due to be empty of other people . He ($_shouto) hated twice as passionately whilst being kicked in the stomach , but hugged twice as hard after his ($_shouto) tears dried into his ($_shouto) cheeks , reduced to a clutching mess in the stronger arms that he ($_shouto) craved . 
 He ($_shouto) begged as loudly as he ($_shouto) could not to be touched when they were together , but broke into unstable fragments each night he ($_shouto) spent alone , insecure that his ($_shouto) father would one day leave him ($_shouto) to starve - Paranoid that bad men would come into his ($_shouto) tower while his ($_shouto) father was n't here to protect him ($_shouto) and be killed . This were the tales he ($_shouto) 'd been told and the false reality he ($_shouto) feared . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) lived a life of contrasts . When times were dark , they blinded him ($_shouto) . But thanks to that darkness , the smallest hints of happiness felt amazing in comparison and he ($_shouto) forgave his ($_shouto) father every single time , more eager to please and be rewarded than to stand up for what he ($_shouto) wants and endure brief but intolerable pain for a chance for a better long term life he ($_shouto) did n't know of . 
 As much as he ($_shouto) thought his ($_shouto) father was a kind man , keeping him ($_shouto) safe and protected here , his ($_shouto) curiosity never left him ($_shouto) and he ($_shouto) wished his ($_shouto) entire life to one day leave the tower and explore the world for himself ($_shouto) with a chance to find his ($_shouto) story , and live like one of the many story book characters he ($_shouto) treasured . 
 On his ($_shouto) eighteenth birthday , he ($_shouto) believed that day had come . 
 Sometimes he ($_shouto) would sit on the windowsill alone and gaze up at the stars through a layer of tears . Other times , his ($_shouto) father would turn soft on him ($_shouto) and hold his ($_shouto) crying body in his ($_shouto) arms and take him ($_shouto) to bed , repeating the mantra in his ($_shouto) ear that everything he ($_shouto) did was for Shouto 's own good . 
 Burning with shame , they ate in silence . The next day when Shouto ($_shouto) innocently addressed the issue , his ($_shouto) father had slammed his ($_shouto) first and demanded they do n't talk of it again . 
 After gaining some sense of reality , his ($_shouto) father had cleared his ($_shouto) throat and summoned his ($_shouto) son to the dinner table , a conflicted , misty look in his ($_shouto) eyes . 
 When Shouto ($_shouto) tiredly opened his ($_shouto) eyes , he ($_shouto) was met with the shell shocked expression of his ($_shouto) father at the door and his ($_shouto) own body jerked up in embarrassment , clambering for his ($_shouto) clothes with his ($_shouto) cheeks burning hot and red . 
 Unknown to him ($_shouto) , his ($_shouto) father had returned home , drawn towards his ($_shouto) son 's screams in terror that something had happened . 
 He ($_shouto) must have been so disgusted , disappointed with his ($_shouto) child . 
 Blue eyes lingered . They were a haunted look Shouto could n't fight away from the guilt that tormented his ($_shouto) stomach for years and years . 
 `` Look at me Shouto ($_shouto) . Everything I 've done is to protect you . If that means killing men , women , children and animals then so be it . You are my top priority my masterpiece , and you will be safe so long as you are in this tower and I am your father . Is that understood?" 
 Shouto ($_shouto) nodded , biting the inside of his ($_shouto) cheek to keep in tears he ($_shouto) wondered why were so persistent in falling . 
 He ($_shouto) had read about certain things in a part of a book that caught his ($_shouto) attention , and he ($_shouto) found himself ($_shouto) drawn to the lower part of his ($_shouto) body - below his ($_shouto) abdomen , yet above his ($_shouto) thighs - in exploration . He ($_shouto) started doing bad things . Things he ($_shouto) figured he ($_shouto) should n't be doing . That 's why it happened . 
 He ($_shouto) did n't stop until he ($_shouto) had found the pleasure that had been described , breath grasping , body pulsing until all he ($_shouto) saw was white . 
 But Shouto ($_shouto) knew better . 
 How could it not be his ($_shouto) own fault ? 
 What happened next was ... well , Shouto ($_shouto) did n't like to think about it . But from that day on , he ($_shouto) did n't want to use his ($_shouto) fire powers any longer . He ($_shouto) felt cursed . Felt that if he ($_shouto) did n't have this ability , he ($_shouto) would n't be locked away behind this lonely walls , away from the glowing lights of the distant Kingdom and the warmth of human company . 
 Of course , his ($_shouto) father told him ($_shouto) that it was n't his ($_shouto) fault . He ($_shouto) 'd stroked his ($_shouto) hair and knelt down to his ($_shouto) eyes level to say that it was the fault of those who forced him ($_shouto) here by trying to attack him ($_shouto) and rob him ($_shouto) of his ($_shouto) powers . 
 It had been his ($_shouto) fault . 
 Definitely his ($_shouto) fault . 
 His ($_shouto) fault . 
 When the_boy ($_shouto) had turned thirteen , his ($_shouto) father started to touch him ($_shouto) . Though , touch did n't feel like a powerful enough word . 
 They sat down to their meal , but just like before , Shouto ($_shouto) was hardly interested . He ($_shouto) sat on the end of his ($_shouto) seat , swinging forwards on it a little as he ($_shouto) asked more questions , about intelligence , about books and where to buy them , about jobs and about life . 
 `` Shouto ($_shouto) . '' He ($_shouto) finally snapped . `` I ($_shouto) do n't have to feed you . '' He ($_shouto) glanced down to the boys full plate . The hetero-chromatic boy tilted his ($_shouto) head in confusion , taking a potato into his ($_shouto) hand . 
 `` But then I 'll die . '' He ($_shouto) commented nonchalantly , albeit a little confused . 
 `` Enough ! '' His ($_shouto) fist struck the table . 
 But he ($_shouto) thought the_man ($_shouto) just wanted to be horrible . 
 His ($_shouto) father had wanted him ($_shouto) to burn it . To cook it to make use of the meat . He ($_shouto) 'd said it would teach Shouto ($_shouto) some sort of lesson about being too soft , about what he ($_shouto) would have to do for survival , or what the harsh world of nature was like outside of the safety of the tower . 
 Shouto ($_shouto) did n't have a problem with the man until one day when he ($_shouto) was twelve . The_adult ($_shouto) had brought a bunny home with him ($_shouto) this time , claiming that he ($_shouto) had found outside of the tower . 
 When the_older_man ($_shouto) unfurled his ($_shouto) arms and dropped the creature abruptly , it whimpered a sound that made the_boy_'s ($_shouto) stomach churn awfully , revealing a harsh wound with an arrow ripping deeply into it , Shouto ($_shouto) could already feel the tears prick in his ($_shouto) eyes with confusion and fear . 
 He ($_shouto) could n't have been more wrong . 
 This was around the time Shouto ($_shouto) believed his ($_shouto) father started to hate him ($_shouto) . Not using his ($_shouto) fire had earned a lot of beatings . Back then , he ($_shouto) had n't been so used to the constant pangs of violence , so it had terrified him ($_shouto) . 
  It was a whole a week later , that he ($_shouto) 'd fallen asleep on the_man_'s ($_shouto) shoulder and woken up to the sounds of the man doing exactly what Shouto ($_shouto) had done to himself ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) could still feel the breath of the grunts against his ($_shouto) ear . The hum of the chest below him ($_shouto) . The way his ($_shouto) own heart jumped - afraid ? Intrigued? Confused. Eventually , he ($_shouto) whispered out . `` Do ... Do I even have a mother ? Any more ... family ? '' 
 It was strange , since Shouto ($_shouto) had been the one insistant on speaking , but was now holding his ($_shouto) tongue . 
 The azure eyes of the older man softened in apology as he ($_shouto) sighed , `` I ($_shouto) 'm sorry about that Shouto , but you know why I ($_shouto) ca n't bring anyone over here . '' 
 He ($_shouto) gulped down what he ($_shouto) had been chewing . `` It 's just that ... there 's never anyone to talk to other than you . '' 
 Some questions were not meant to be answered . This was a lesson he ($_shouto) 'd already learnt and would never forget . 
 `` No . '' He ($_shouto) said firmly , watching his ($_shouto) gullible little child 's round eyes widen in upset . `` Your ($_shouto) mother is dead . And I ($_shouto) 'm the one who killed her . '' 
 The violent whirring of the wind outside scratched at the stone walls of the tower . To the Father , he ($_shouto) felt it 's coldness pierce right into his ($_shouto) heart . 
 

($_sho)	Nobody could have guessed the child would inherit the rose 's power as well as it 's beauty , at least not until Sho_'s ($_sho) third year of living ; a year famous for the tales it had birthed . 
 Evidently , Prince_Sho_'s ($_sho) beauty was enamouring . 
 The_King ($_the) became quiet . Prince_Sho ($_sho) was no longer brought into public , and for a long time , the only people that left the tower were tight lipped and frowning . 
 

($_wood)	A pan clinked . Wood ($_wood) knocked together as it was thrown into the fire place , behind him ($_wood) as he ($_wood) kept his ($_wood) head down and his ($_wood) eyes on the fascinating pages . 
 

($_queen)	One story claimed the_King ($_the) and Queen ($_queen) had heard giggling from their ($_queen) sons room , and when they ($_queen) 'd entered had found a vast dome of ice crystals surrounding their ($_queen) baby . 
 Whilst the_Queen ($_the) had been terrified , instantly checking all the bolts on all the windows for signs of intrusion , the_King ($_the) had just stood shocked in confusion , comically so as their ($_queen) son continued to chuckle , not disheartened in the slightest by their ($_queen) befuddlement . Rumours say it took them ($_queen) nearly an hour to realise that the ice had come from him . 
 Though others argued that was n't how it went at all , but that the baby boy had detained a group of intruders all alone by freezing them ($_queen) - burning them ($_queen) to a ash or crisp - or some even say his pretty , unique eyes had turned into lasers and zapped them ($_queen) down right there .
