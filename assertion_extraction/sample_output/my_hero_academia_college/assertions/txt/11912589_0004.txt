($_momo)	The_dragon ($_the) merely blinked in response and curled up on the coins again . Kaminari and Momo ($_momo) settled down for the night , apparently satisfied after upending Kirishima ($_kirishima) s life . Bakugou , who was still inexplicably a badger , flopped down next to them . 
  Ameles ($_ameles) listened to Momo ($_momo) sum up all the events that led up to that moment . The_dragon ($_the) exhaled , deep in thought . You may rest the night in my lair . I will fly you to this settlement in the morning . My thanks for your tale . Momo ($_momo) brightened . That s the one that reverses the effects of a spell , yes ? Where does it normally grow ? 
 Kaminari ($_kaminari) set sparks dancing over his ($_kaminari) hands and loped off , following a trail of burned leaves . The track continued for a while until it disappeared into an aperture set into a rocky cliffside . A small brook looped around the hill , babbling in cheerful contrast to the ominous darkness . Momo ($_momo) looked at the cave entrance anxiously , lantern swinging in her grip . This does not feel safe at all . 
 Kiss. Kiss. Kaminari ($_kaminari) turned it into a chant , which Momo ($_momo) picked up . The_dragon ($_the) s eye glinted with a dangerous light . 
 Momo ($_momo) frowned . What does this look like ? 
 Kaminari and Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped their jousting match as she ($_kirishima) distributed bread , cheese and a couple of apples . Momo ($_momo) settled on the ground next to you to eat her ($_kirishima) share , shyly responding to your questions . You laughed and broke your loaf in half . 
 He took point and cautiously inched into the cave . You crept in behind him , Momo ($_momo) and Kaminari ($_kaminari) following . It seemed to be a cave straight of out a storybook , needle-like stalactites dripping water onto the rough-hewn floor . The light from Momo ($_momo) s lantern bobbed with her movement , making every shadow larger and more menacing . 
 Momo ($_momo) sucked in a breath . I ($_kiri) ve never seen so much gold before . 
 Oh , let me , let me ! Kaminari ($_kaminari) jogged over , enthusiasm pouring off him ($_kaminari) in waves . Momo ($_momo) followed reluctantly , Bakugou ($_bakugou) trotting beside her ($_kaminari) . 
 Momo ($_momo) folded her legs underneath her , apparently resigned to the current state of affairs . Have you read a lot of books , then ? 
 Momo ($_momo) scrounged around in what Kirishima ($_kirishima) was starting to think of as her ($_kirishima) magic satchel and came up with several edible items . Here , it s not much , but it will tide us over till morning . 
  Momo ($_momo) s eyes lit with understanding around the same time Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt his ($_momo) stomach plummet . Of course , they had to pass various tests . In one , the princess would be kidnapped by pirates and need to be rescued . Of course , it was just a ruse . Until real pirates attacked , and the ship capsized . Kirishima ($_kirishima) raised his ($_kirishima) head to ask him ($_kirishima) what exactly that statement meant when Momo ($_momo) got his ($_momo) attention . I ($_kirishima) have a question , she ($_kaminari) started . 
 You deftly grabbed Bakugou ($_bakugou) and snuggled him ($_bakugou) again , leaving Kirishima ($_kirishima) with a burning feeling in his ($_bakugou) gut . He ($_bakugou) reminded himself ($_bakugou) he ($_bakugou) had no right , but the fire kept burning merrily . Oblivious to everything , Bakugou ($_bakugou) flailed madly . Go on , Momo ($_momo) . 
 A clink alerted them to a small presence . Momo ($_momo) angled the light to reveal Bakugou snuffling around the back of the cave , single-mindedly heading for a patch of small , pointed leaves . 
 By unanimous agreement -LRB- not counting Bakugou ($_bakugou) s attempt to bite someone -RRB- , camp was set up for the night . The river was deemed too dangerous to cross , and a longer detour would have to be taken . Momo ($_momo) disappeared into the woods for an interval and came back with lengths of fabric which , she assured everyone , were completely waterproof . 
 Momo ($_momo) frantically tried to refuse , but you kept at her with a pleasant doggedness until she gave in . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rested his ($_kirishima) chin on his ($_kirishima) hand , giving in to the urge to watch you be you . Kaminari ($_kaminari) plopped down next to him ($_kirishima) , sticking his ($_kirishima) tongue out at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
 

($_ameles)	 Ameles ($_ameles) listened to Momo ($_momo) sum up all the events that led up to that moment . The_dragon ($_the) exhaled , deep in thought . You may rest the night in my lair . I will fly you to this settlement in the morning . My thanks for your tale . Ameles ($_ameles) snorted . I would wager you are the elated one , princess . 
 Ameles ($_ameles) lowered her ($_ameles) horned head . When did you first encounter this knight ? 
 If you agree , I will show you . Ameles ($_ameles) swept her gaze over the room , registering no objections . Well then. 
 Of course she ($_ameles) loves him . More than anyone and anything . The words dropped like a pebble into the silence , rippling outward in ever-rising waves . 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) tried not to flush under the praise , and failed miserably . Ameles ($_ameles) huffed impatiently .  No , I ($_ameles) refer to the knight s heart . He ($_ameles) was in love with the princess , was he ($_ameles) not ? They always are . Why does he ($_ameles) not try to win her ($_ameles) ? You know , I ($_ameles) keep wondering the same thing , quipped Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Tell us , Kiri ($_kiri) . Why doesn t he ($_ameles) make a move ? 
 Ameles ($_ameles) swung her ($_ameles) tail from side to side , intrigued . What of the knight , then ? 
 He ($_ameles) was by my - her ($_ameles) side , of course , you said . Being a brave and loyal man , he ($_ameles) guarded her ($_ameles) through the whole ordeal . 
 Everyone turned to look at you . You clasped your hands and looked away . The knight has been with the princess since she ($_ameles) was a child . He has seen her ($_ameles) at her ($_ameles) worst , and stayed with her ($_ameles) anyway . What do you think she ($_ameles) feels ? 
 It was starting to get really infuriating . Because , he ($_ameles) bit out , face still hot , maybe he ($_ameles) thinks he ($_ameles) can never match up to her ($_ameles) . She ($_ameles) s a princess , and the reality is that a boy from the streets doesn t make marriage material for royalty . 
  He ($_ameles) heard you suck in a breath , but didn t have time to dwell on it . The_dragon ($_the) shuffled her ($_ameles) wings . I ($_ameles) do not understand this assumption . Perhaps he ($_ameles) should just ask the princess how she ($_ameles) feels . What does she ($_ameles) think ? The huge reptile considered him ($_kirishima) for a long , tense moment before pressing its snout into his ($_kirishima) palm . I am called Ameles ($_ameles) . 
 No , said Ameles ($_ameles) with a rumble , don t. Gigantic wings unfolded , blocking out the light . I wish to hear your tale . I am fond of stories . 
 You have comrades , observed Ameles ($_ameles) . This is to be expected . The knight is accompanied by other adventurers in the tales I have heard . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) froze as Ameles ($_ameles) looked at him expectantly . Of all the things - he d kill Kaminari ($_kaminari) if the dragon didn t get him first . He risked a quick look at you . You looked mildly anxious , but then again , you didn t know anything . He swallowed hard . 
 Ameles ($_ameles) dipped her muzzle in a sign to continue . He took a breath , heart hammering in his ears . And then , you cut in , much to his everlasting gratitude , the knight returns to protect his princess and everything goes well . The end . 
 Ameles ($_ameles) made a growling noise that might have been laughter . I can not speak for the rest of my brethren s temperament , but most of us would not devour humans . They are skinny , and their weapons tend to stick in our fangs . 
 Ameles ($_ameles) blinked once . This does not sound very different so far . 
 

($_kaminari)	Kaminari ($_kaminari) set sparks dancing over his ($_kaminari) hands and loped off , following a trail of burned leaves . The track continued for a while until it disappeared into an aperture set into a rocky cliffside . A small brook looped around the hill , babbling in cheerful contrast to the ominous darkness . Momo ($_momo) looked at the cave entrance anxiously , lantern swinging in her grip . This does not feel safe at all . 
 Kaminari ($_kaminari) gulped . Was it the giant claw marks on the wall or the general creepiness that tipped you off ? 
 Okay , so I m really liking him ($_bakugou) as a critter . He ($_bakugou) s useful and he ($_bakugou) can t talk , chirped Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) promptly scuttled towards him ($_bakugou) , fangs bared . The blond yelped and tried to scramble out of the way . 
 Kisssssss , called Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Kiss her ($_kaminari) , Red . 
 Kiss. Kiss. Kaminari ($_kaminari) turned it into a chant , which Momo ($_momo) picked up . The_dragon ($_the) s eye glinted with a dangerous light . 
 Whoa ($_whoa) , yelled Kaminari ($_kaminari) , it ($_whoa) talks ! 
  Kaminari ($_kaminari) s victorious snicker , the sound of the dragon rustling , it all seemed so far away . He ($_kaminari) pressed a hand to his ($_kaminari) chest , as if he ($_kaminari) could quell the racing in it . Maybe he ($_kaminari) was dreaming . But I-I heard you say to Mina that you d never think of me that way , he ($_kaminari) stammered . That I was like a brother to you . Then , for a while , everything was fine . Neither of them was lonely any more . But then as they grew older , things became complicated . Kaminari ($_kaminari) paused to think . By the way , is it true that dragons can tell when people are lying ? 
 Try me , said Kaminari ($_kaminari) excitedly . 
 You know , I ($_ameles) keep wondering the same thing , quipped Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Tell us , Kiri ($_kiri) . Why doesn t he ($_ameles) make a move ? 
 I don t like this , whined Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Can t we just wait for him ($_kaminari) outside ? 
 He took point and cautiously inched into the cave . You crept in behind him , Momo ($_momo) and Kaminari ($_kaminari) following . It seemed to be a cave straight of out a storybook , needle-like stalactites dripping water onto the rough-hewn floor . The light from Momo ($_momo) s lantern bobbed with her movement , making every shadow larger and more menacing . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) tilted his ($_kaminari) head , listening . A soft , wheezy sound came from somewhere , rising and falling . The passageway suddenly opened into a large , cavernous hollow . From a tiny crack in the ceiling , moonlight illuminated parts of the cave . 
 Oh , let me , let me ! Kaminari ($_kaminari) jogged over , enthusiasm pouring off him ($_kaminari) in waves . Momo ($_momo) followed reluctantly , Bakugou ($_bakugou) trotting beside her ($_kaminari) . 
 Great , said Kaminari ($_kaminari) , dusting his ($_kaminari) hands off after erecting something like a tent , now what do we do for a fire ? 
 What they forgot to tell you , added Kaminari ($_kaminari) hastily , was that the princess uncle loved her ($_kaminari) dearly . His greatest desire was to ensure her ($_kaminari) happiness , so he decided to hold a grand fete . Suitors from every continent could vie for her ($_kaminari) hand , and she ($_kaminari) would pick someone to marry at the end of it . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) froze as Ameles ($_ameles) looked at him expectantly . Of all the things - he d kill Kaminari ($_kaminari) if the dragon didn t get him first . He risked a quick look at you . You looked mildly anxious , but then again , you didn t know anything . He swallowed hard . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) slumped forward with a groan . Kaminari ($_kaminari) , I ($_kirishima) told you no . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) raised his ($_kirishima) head to ask him ($_kirishima) what exactly that statement meant when Momo ($_momo) got his ($_momo) attention . I ($_kirishima) have a question , she ($_kaminari) started . 
 Kaminari ($_kaminari) let out a heartfelt sigh . You two are going to be the death of me ($_kirishima) . At least she ($_kaminari) tries . You though ... 
 Are you sure ? Are you absolutely sure ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) looked unusually grouchy . 
 Finally , breathed Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Thank heaven . Praise be to the goddess . 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) caught you ($_kiri) around the waist in instant reflex , but you ($_kiri) had gone well over your ($_kiri) centre of balance . He ($_kirishima) stumbled back with you ($_kiri) into a pile of coins . Bakugou ($_bakugou) escaped from your ($_kiri) hold and scampered towards Kaminari ($_kaminari) . A small chest of emeralds teetered , and crashed to the floor . Momo and Kaminari ($_kaminari) reluctantly agreed to keep watch , and act as decoys if it came to that . Kirishima ($_kirishima) narrowed his ($_kirishima) eyes at you ($_kiri) . Princess , it would be better if you ($_kiri) just let me do it . I won t be harmed , but you ($_kiri) will . 
 Well , props to him , he found the parsley . Now what? How do we get around the_dragon ($_the) ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) peered around the edge of a wall . I don t want to be here when it wakes up and decides it s peckish . 
 Momo ($_momo) frantically tried to refuse , but you kept at her with a pleasant doggedness until she gave in . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rested his ($_kirishima) chin on his ($_kirishima) hand , giving in to the urge to watch you be you . Kaminari ($_kaminari) plopped down next to him ($_kirishima) , sticking his ($_kirishima) tongue out at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) made a chuffing noise while Kaminari ($_kaminari) flailed . My bad , I shouldn t have assumed . I ll start now . Once upon a time , in a floating kingdom not so far away , there was a fair princess and her faithful knight . 
 Do I ever . Kaminari ($_kaminari) rubbed his ($_kaminari) hands gleefully . Sit down , sir , and let me tell you a story . 
 Gee , thanks , said Kaminari ($_kaminari) dryly . Do you have a preference ? Ghost stories , perhaps ? 
 

($_whoa)	It ($_whoa) has a name , said the dragon with an irritated huff . At least have the courtesy to ask when you ($_kiri) invade my home . 
 Whoa ($_whoa) , yelled Kaminari ($_kaminari) , it ($_whoa) talks ! 
 

($_standing)	We ($_standing) have to go after him , urged Kirishima_,_standing_up_to_pull_his_jacket_back_on ($_standing) . Magnolia has wolves and other predators in the woods . 
 

($_the)	The_dragon ($_the) merely blinked in response and curled up on the coins again . Kaminari and Momo ($_momo) settled down for the night , apparently satisfied after upending Kirishima ($_kirishima) s life . Bakugou , who was still inexplicably a badger , flopped down next to them . 
  Ameles ($_ameles) listened to Momo ($_momo) sum up all the events that led up to that moment . The_dragon ($_the) exhaled , deep in thought . You may rest the night in my lair . I will fly you to this settlement in the morning . My thanks for your tale . Kiss. Kiss. Kaminari ($_kaminari) turned it into a chant , which Momo ($_momo) picked up . The_dragon ($_the) s eye glinted with a dangerous light . 
 You ($_kiri) squeezed his hand once and went back to staring down the_dragon ($_the) . Okay , because this is not looking good so far . 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped breathing as it ($_the) levelled its ($_the) snout at you ($_kiri) , maw opening slightly . Deadly teeth glinted in the dim light . Ancient magic , thick and heavy , coiled in the air . You ($_kiri) pressed back into the damp wall , face pale . It looked hopeless , utterly hopeless .  All activity halted as the_dragon ($_the) slowly roused itself . A sapphire eye , large as a dinner plate , blinked open .  You ($_kiri) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) slowly backed up against the wall , hoping it wouldn t see you ($_kiri) . The beast flicked out a forked tongue , tasting the air . A low , raspy noise built in its throat . Just when his back hit the wall , the_dragon ($_the) swivelled its ($_the) head and spotted the both of you ($_kiri) . Dead parents , mused the_dragon ($_the) . This ($_the) is also expected . Humans have a great deal of sadness in their lives . What happens next? 
 The_dragon ($_the) s eyes began to glow , until the brilliance was almost blinding . A circle of light spread out from her to encompass the cavern , then petered out . It is done . 
  He ($_ameles) heard you suck in a breath , but didn t have time to dwell on it . The_dragon ($_the) shuffled her ($_ameles) wings . I ($_ameles) do not understand this assumption . Perhaps he ($_ameles) should just ask the princess how she ($_ameles) feels . What does she ($_ameles) think ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) got over his ($_kirishima) surprise and held out a hand to it . Your ($_kiri) eyes flickered back and forth between him ($_kirishima) and the_dragon ($_the) , worried . Sorry about that . It s my first time meeting a dragon . I m Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
 He ($_kirishima) nearly punched a wall in frustration . Now you were stuck here until the_dragon ($_the) was satisfied . You pursed your lips and regarded it ($_the) warily . Where should I start ? 
 Not entirely prepared to get in an argument when he could barely talk above a hush , Kirishima ($_kirishima) nodded . He began picking his way through the small mountains of treasure , internally cursing the_dragon ($_the) s predilection for shiny things . His heart briefly stuttered when you ($_kiri) reached out and grabbed his hand . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was glad for the semi-darkness that hid his reddened face . 
 Kiri ($_kiri) and I can retrieve Bakugou ($_bakugou) , you ($_kiri) mused . The biggest problem right now is that he ($_kiri) might set off an explosion and annoy the_dragon ($_the) . We ll grab him ($_kiri) and keep him ($_kiri) quiet . 
 Well , props to him , he found the parsley . Now what? How do we get around the_dragon ($_the) ? Kaminari ($_kaminari) peered around the edge of a wall . I don t want to be here when it wakes up and decides it s peckish . 
 There was an annoyed flick of the_dragon_s_tail ($_the) . Young human , I am a she-dragon . 
 The_dragon ($_the) blew out a plume of smoke from its ($_the) nostrils . I favour tales of love and bravery , but those inevitably end with one of our kind dead in an attempt to rescue a princess . Do you know any others ? 
 The_dragon ($_the) turned to regard her with a starlit eye . I can not read human writing , but travellers such as yourself have given me the gift of stories in return for valuables . In human stories , the knights are always trying to kill dragons , is that not so ? 
 

($_bakugou)	Your Grace , stop ! You stood up in a flustered rustle as Bakugou ($_bakugou) leapt out of your arms and sprinted into the forest . 
 Okay , so I m really liking him ($_bakugou) as a critter . He ($_bakugou) s useful and he ($_bakugou) can t talk , chirped Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) promptly scuttled towards him ($_bakugou) , fangs bared . The blond yelped and tried to scramble out of the way . 
 On cue , a furry form padded over with a clump of branches between its teeth . Bakugou ($_bakugou) spat out the twigs onto a pile he ($_bakugou) had been collecting , then whacked the wood with a clawed foot . A tiny boom occurred , and suddenly the twigs were on fire . The honey badger chuffed contemptuously and looked at them as if to say he ($_bakugou) was still superior . 
 Kaminari and Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped their jousting match as she ($_kirishima) distributed bread , cheese and a couple of apples . Momo ($_momo) settled on the ground next to you to eat her ($_kirishima) share , shyly responding to your questions . You laughed and broke your loaf in half . 
 Oh , let me , let me ! Kaminari ($_kaminari) jogged over , enthusiasm pouring off him ($_kaminari) in waves . Momo ($_momo) followed reluctantly , Bakugou ($_bakugou) trotting beside her ($_kaminari) . 
 The_bosun ($_bakugou) indicated the wriggling badger . How do we restore the duke to normalcy ? He ($_bakugou) can t live like this forever . 
 You deftly grabbed Bakugou ($_bakugou) and snuggled him ($_bakugou) again , leaving Kirishima ($_kirishima) with a burning feeling in his ($_bakugou) gut . He ($_bakugou) reminded himself ($_bakugou) he ($_bakugou) had no right , but the fire kept burning merrily . Oblivious to everything , Bakugou ($_bakugou) flailed madly . Go on , Momo ($_momo) . 
  Yes , it is a problem , you murmured , absently rubbing behind one of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s fuzzy ears . He ($_bakugou) drooped and made a rumbling noise . The blaze in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s gut escalated to a bonfire . He ($_bakugou) laced his ($_bakugou) fingers together to keep from doing something stupid . Maybe we can find a mage that knows something about transformation spells ?  Kirishima ($_kirishima) caught you ($_kiri) around the waist in instant reflex , but you ($_kiri) had gone well over your ($_kiri) centre of balance . He ($_kirishima) stumbled back with you ($_kiri) into a pile of coins . Bakugou ($_bakugou) escaped from your ($_kiri) hold and scampered towards Kaminari ($_kaminari) . A small chest of emeralds teetered , and crashed to the floor . He nearly heaved an audible sigh of relief when you ($_kiri) reached the back of the cave without mishap . You ($_kiri) waited till Bakugou ($_bakugou) was distracted with rooting up a plant to snatch him ($_bakugou) up . You ($_kiri) closed your ($_kiri) fingers around his ($_bakugou) muzzle before he ($_bakugou) could growl in rage . 
 Kiri ($_kiri) and I can retrieve Bakugou ($_bakugou) , you ($_kiri) mused . The biggest problem right now is that he ($_kiri) might set off an explosion and annoy the_dragon ($_the) . We ll grab him ($_kiri) and keep him ($_kiri) quiet . 
 By unanimous agreement -LRB- not counting Bakugou ($_bakugou) s attempt to bite someone -RRB- , camp was set up for the night . The river was deemed too dangerous to cross , and a longer detour would have to be taken . Momo ($_momo) disappeared into the woods for an interval and came back with lengths of fabric which , she assured everyone , were completely waterproof . 
 Momo ($_momo) frantically tried to refuse , but you kept at her with a pleasant doggedness until she gave in . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rested his ($_kirishima) chin on his ($_kirishima) hand , giving in to the urge to watch you be you . Kaminari ($_kaminari) plopped down next to him ($_kirishima) , sticking his ($_kirishima) tongue out at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) made a chuffing noise while Kaminari ($_kaminari) flailed . My bad , I shouldn t have assumed . I ll start now . Once upon a time , in a floating kingdom not so far away , there was a fair princess and her faithful knight . 
 

($_kirishima)	The_dragon ($_the) merely blinked in response and curled up on the coins again . Kaminari and Momo ($_momo) settled down for the night , apparently satisfied after upending Kirishima ($_kirishima) s life . Bakugou , who was still inexplicably a badger , flopped down next to them . 
 Or , Kirishima ($_kirishima) suggested , we could look for silver parsley around here . 
 No , I m really not going - He stopped in shock when you slid your hands up his face and pressed your lips to his cheek . Kirishima ($_kirishima) touched the spot , trying to keep the butterfly-light sensation with him . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) cleared his ($_kirishima) throat awkwardly . Anyway , he ($_kirishima) interjected , we need to get going . We have to regroup at Clover as soon as we can . Thank you for , erm , not eating us . 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped breathing as it ($_the) levelled its ($_the) snout at you ($_kiri) , maw opening slightly . Deadly teeth glinted in the dim light . Ancient magic , thick and heavy , coiled in the air . You ($_kiri) pressed back into the damp wall , face pale . It looked hopeless , utterly hopeless .  You ($_kiri) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) slowly backed up against the wall , hoping it wouldn t see you ($_kiri) . The beast flicked out a forked tongue , tasting the air . A low , raspy noise built in its throat . Just when his back hit the wall , the_dragon ($_the) swivelled its ($_the) head and spotted the both of you ($_kiri) . You cautiously drew closer . Kirishima ($_kirishima) snapped his ($_kirishima) gaze back to you when you touched his ($_kirishima) arm lightly . Do you ... not feel the same way ? Your eyes were wide with hope . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) slowly lifted his ($_kirishima) eyes to your face . The world dropped from under him ($_kirishima) again at the sight of your pinked cheeks . I said , you repeated , voice wavering , I love you . I always have . And I always will . 
 Oh gods . Kirishima ($_kirishima) covered his ($_kirishima) mouth with a hand , glancing away in embarrassment . I can t believe this . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) stiffened as the narration started becoming a little too familiar . You raised an eyebrow , but said nothing . 
 Kaminari and Bakugou ($_bakugou) stopped their jousting match as she ($_kirishima) distributed bread , cheese and a couple of apples . Momo ($_momo) settled on the ground next to you to eat her ($_kirishima) share , shyly responding to your questions . You laughed and broke your loaf in half . 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) tried not to flush under the praise , and failed miserably . Ameles ($_ameles) huffed impatiently . Kirishima ($_kirishima) s stomach dropped . Of course you wouldn t want him that way . He d heard you say so once , why he did ever hope you d change your mind ? He tightened his fist and hoped that no one could hear the sound of his heart breaking . 
 Everyone nodded in agreement . I ll go first , said Kirishima ($_kirishima) . Less risk that way . 
 Metallic coins lay scattered about in careless heaps by the thousands , piled high enough to reach Kirishima ($_kirishima) s waist . Jewels as big as his fist were mixed in like glittering polka dots , along with what looked like a collection of swords and a chest full of scrolls . What really caught his eye though , was the massive reptilian body curled up on top of the treasure . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) tilted his ($_kaminari) head , listening . A soft , wheezy sound came from somewhere , rising and falling . The passageway suddenly opened into a large , cavernous hollow . From a tiny crack in the ceiling , moonlight illuminated parts of the cave . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) got over his ($_kirishima) surprise and held out a hand to it . Your ($_kiri) eyes flickered back and forth between him ($_kirishima) and the_dragon ($_the) , worried . Sorry about that . It s my first time meeting a dragon . I m Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
 The huge reptile considered him ($_kirishima) for a long , tense moment before pressing its snout into his ($_kirishima) palm . I am called Ameles ($_ameles) . 
 His ($_kirishima) shoulders relaxed as he ($_kirishima) realized it wasn t going to eat them , at least for now . You curtsied to Ameles . It is an honour to meet you . I am the princess of Fiore , ____ . 
 It s a long story , he ($_kirishima) said by way of explanation . Well , don t let us keep you . We ll just be on our way . Apologies for waking you up . 
 He ($_kirishima) nearly punched a wall in frustration . Now you were stuck here until the_dragon ($_the) was satisfied . You pursed your lips and regarded it ($_the) warily . Where should I start ? 
 Momo ($_momo) scrounged around in what Kirishima ($_kirishima) was starting to think of as her ($_kirishima) magic satchel and came up with several edible items . Here , it s not much , but it will tide us over till morning . 
  Momo ($_momo) s eyes lit with understanding around the same time Kirishima ($_kirishima) felt his ($_momo) stomach plummet . Of course , they had to pass various tests . In one , the princess would be kidnapped by pirates and need to be rescued . Of course , it was just a ruse . Until real pirates attacked , and the ship capsized . Actually , he said with a sly glance in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s direction , Kiri ($_kiri) will tell it from now . He knows it much better than I do . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) froze as Ameles ($_ameles) looked at him expectantly . Of all the things - he d kill Kaminari ($_kaminari) if the dragon didn t get him first . He risked a quick look at you . You looked mildly anxious , but then again , you didn t know anything . He swallowed hard . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) slumped forward with a groan . Kaminari ($_kaminari) , I ($_kirishima) told you no . 
 So , he ($_kirishima) started in a voice that Kirishima ($_kirishima) knew meant trouble , I ($_kirishima) take it you made no progress today either ? 
 Maybe , he mumbled into his arms . But I ($_kirishima) didn t notice until I ($_kirishima) got back from training . 
 It ($_kirishima) s because you can t see how frustrating it is from the outside ! The lightning mage gritted his teeth . Haven t you been in love with her , for like , a decade ? 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) raised his ($_kirishima) head to ask him ($_kirishima) what exactly that statement meant when Momo ($_momo) got his ($_momo) attention . I ($_kirishima) have a question , she ($_kaminari) started . 
 Kaminari ($_kaminari) let out a heartfelt sigh . You two are going to be the death of me ($_kirishima) . At least she ($_kaminari) tries . You though ... 
 You deftly grabbed Bakugou ($_bakugou) and snuggled him ($_bakugou) again , leaving Kirishima ($_kirishima) with a burning feeling in his ($_bakugou) gut . He ($_bakugou) reminded himself ($_bakugou) he ($_bakugou) had no right , but the fire kept burning merrily . Oblivious to everything , Bakugou ($_bakugou) flailed madly . Go on , Momo ($_momo) . 
  Yes , it is a problem , you murmured , absently rubbing behind one of Bakugou ($_bakugou) s fuzzy ears . He ($_bakugou) drooped and made a rumbling noise . The blaze in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s gut escalated to a bonfire . He ($_bakugou) laced his ($_bakugou) fingers together to keep from doing something stupid . Maybe we can find a mage that knows something about transformation spells ? Kirishima ($_kirishima) jerked his ($_kirishima) head in the direction of the entrance . Let s go . 
  Disaster struck when he ($_kirishima) made it halfway around the cavern . You ($_kiri) tumbled over an outcropping with a soft gasp .  Kirishima ($_kirishima) caught you ($_kiri) around the waist in instant reflex , but you ($_kiri) had gone well over your ($_kiri) centre of balance . He ($_kirishima) stumbled back with you ($_kiri) into a pile of coins . Bakugou ($_bakugou) escaped from your ($_kiri) hold and scampered towards Kaminari ($_kaminari) . A small chest of emeralds teetered , and crashed to the floor . Not entirely prepared to get in an argument when he could barely talk above a hush , Kirishima ($_kirishima) nodded . He began picking his way through the small mountains of treasure , internally cursing the_dragon ($_the) s predilection for shiny things . His heart briefly stuttered when you ($_kiri) reached out and grabbed his hand . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was glad for the semi-darkness that hid his reddened face . 
 Momo and Kaminari ($_kaminari) reluctantly agreed to keep watch , and act as decoys if it came to that . Kirishima ($_kirishima) narrowed his ($_kirishima) eyes at you ($_kiri) . Princess , it would be better if you ($_kiri) just let me do it . I won t be harmed , but you ($_kiri) will . 
 You chuckled at their antics , eyes glowing in the firelight . Kirishima ($_kirishima) tried not watch the way the shadows danced over your skin , shifting over the winged lines of your collarbones . You had abandoned your jacket in favour of using it as a pillow . Your hair was in tangled loops , dress torn and muddied from trekking through a forest . He d still never seen anything quite as beautiful , or beloved . 
 Momo ($_momo) frantically tried to refuse , but you kept at her with a pleasant doggedness until she gave in . Kirishima ($_kirishima) rested his ($_kirishima) chin on his ($_kirishima) hand , giving in to the urge to watch you be you . Kaminari ($_kaminari) plopped down next to him ($_kirishima) , sticking his ($_kirishima) tongue out at Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
 

($_kiri)	Let s go , Kiri ($_kiri) . 
 Stupid Kiri ($_kiri) . You hit his chest weakly . There is no one better than you . And even if there is , I don t want them . I love you . 
 It ($_whoa) has a name , said the dragon with an irritated huff . At least have the courtesy to ask when you ($_kiri) invade my home . 
 You ($_kiri) squeezed his hand once and went back to staring down the_dragon ($_the) . Okay , because this is not looking good so far . 
 If you ($_kiri) re done saying goodbye to each other , came a voice in his head , can you ($_kiri) kindly explain why you ($_kiri) re disturbing my slumber ? 
 You ($_kiri) flashed him a quick smile that made his pulse skip . Always. 
  Kirishima ($_kirishima) stopped breathing as it ($_the) levelled its ($_the) snout at you ($_kiri) , maw opening slightly . Deadly teeth glinted in the dim light . Ancient magic , thick and heavy , coiled in the air . You ($_kiri) pressed back into the damp wall , face pale . It looked hopeless , utterly hopeless .  You ($_kiri) and Kirishima ($_kirishima) slowly backed up against the wall , hoping it wouldn t see you ($_kiri) . The beast flicked out a forked tongue , tasting the air . A low , raspy noise built in its throat . Just when his back hit the wall , the_dragon ($_the) swivelled its ($_the) head and spotted the both of you ($_kiri) . You ($_kiri) reached out and found his hand . Kiri ($_kiri) , if we die here , I just want you ($_kiri) to know - 
 You know , I ($_ameles) keep wondering the same thing , quipped Kaminari ($_kaminari) . Tell us , Kiri ($_kiri) . Why doesn t he ($_ameles) make a move ? 
 Kiri ($_kiri) , you ($_kiri) breathed in awe , is that really a dragon ? It s bigger than a cottage . 
 Momo ($_momo) sucked in a breath . I ($_kiri) ve never seen so much gold before . 
 Kiri ($_kiri) , you ($_kiri) said urgently , I ($_kiri) hear a noise . Like breathing . 
 Kirishima ($_kirishima) got over his ($_kirishima) surprise and held out a hand to it . Your ($_kiri) eyes flickered back and forth between him ($_kirishima) and the_dragon ($_the) , worried . Sorry about that . It s my first time meeting a dragon . I m Kirishima ($_kirishima) . 
 Actually , he said with a sly glance in Kirishima ($_kirishima) s direction , Kiri ($_kiri) will tell it from now . He knows it much better than I do . 
  Disaster struck when he ($_kirishima) made it halfway around the cavern . You ($_kiri) tumbled over an outcropping with a soft gasp .  Kirishima ($_kirishima) caught you ($_kiri) around the waist in instant reflex , but you ($_kiri) had gone well over your ($_kiri) centre of balance . He ($_kirishima) stumbled back with you ($_kiri) into a pile of coins . Bakugou ($_bakugou) escaped from your ($_kiri) hold and scampered towards Kaminari ($_kaminari) . A small chest of emeralds teetered , and crashed to the floor . He nearly heaved an audible sigh of relief when you ($_kiri) reached the back of the cave without mishap . You ($_kiri) waited till Bakugou ($_bakugou) was distracted with rooting up a plant to snatch him ($_bakugou) up . You ($_kiri) closed your ($_kiri) fingers around his ($_bakugou) muzzle before he ($_bakugou) could growl in rage . 
 You ($_kiri) gave him ($_kiri) a flat look . I m doing this , Kiri ($_kiri) . It s partly my fault we re in this situation . 
 Not entirely prepared to get in an argument when he could barely talk above a hush , Kirishima ($_kirishima) nodded . He began picking his way through the small mountains of treasure , internally cursing the_dragon ($_the) s predilection for shiny things . His heart briefly stuttered when you ($_kiri) reached out and grabbed his hand . Kirishima ($_kirishima) was glad for the semi-darkness that hid his reddened face . 
 Kiri ($_kiri) and I can retrieve Bakugou ($_bakugou) , you ($_kiri) mused . The biggest problem right now is that he ($_kiri) might set off an explosion and annoy the_dragon ($_the) . We ll grab him ($_kiri) and keep him ($_kiri) quiet . 
 Momo and Kaminari ($_kaminari) reluctantly agreed to keep watch , and act as decoys if it came to that . Kirishima ($_kirishima) narrowed his ($_kirishima) eyes at you ($_kiri) . Princess , it would be better if you ($_kiri) just let me do it . I won t be harmed , but you ($_kiri) will .
