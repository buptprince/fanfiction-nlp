($_momo)	 She ($_izuku) sharply turns and opens the door to her ($_izuku) room , closing it behind her ($_izuku) with a loud bang . Tenya ($_tenya) and Izuku ($_izuku) stand frozen for a moment , before Izuku ($_izuku) sighs , and turns to follow where Shoto ($_shoto) went earlier . Tenya ($_tenya) has to take a deep breath before he ($_tenya) enters his ($_tenya) own room . Katsuki ($_katsuki) is lying on his ($_katsuki) bed , hands behind his ($_katsuki) head and his ($_katsuki) eyes closed . When the door closes behind Tenya , he ($_katsuki) cracks one eye open , only to close it again . Tenya ($_tenya) sets his ($_tenya) bag down at the end of the other bed and sits down on the mattress , not sure where to begin with what to say to the other boy who was clearly ignoring him ($_tenya) . Momo ($_momo) had said an apology , and loathe as he ($_momo) was to admit it , he ($_momo) was glad that she ($_izuku) had emerged from her ($_izuku) room to give them a much needed motherly scolding . Like I give a shit ! He says , and Ochako ($_ochako) rolls her ($_ochako) eyes . She ($_ochako) thought she ($_ochako) might ve made some progress in trying to speak to him , but it s clear that he truly doesn t have any interest in making friends , so she ($_ochako) speeds up her ($_ochako) pace considerably to join up with Tenya and Momo ($_momo) . Katsuki ($_katsuki) makes an annoyed noise , glaring at the ground as he trudges along behind the rest of the group . 
 A few hours later , when Ochako ($_ochako) complains that her ($_ochako) legs are sore from walking , Tenya ($_tenya) gives up his ($_tenya) horse to the girl and ends up walking . Ochako ($_ochako) strikes up a new animated conversation with Momo ($_momo) , and Tenya ($_tenya) finds himself ($_tenya) walking beside Katsuki ($_katsuki) . The blonde glares at him ($_tenya) , making his ($_tenya) intentions clear , but Tenya ($_tenya) staunchly keeps his ($_tenya) head facing forward , effectively ignoring the dragon tamer . It s almost dark by the time Tenya ($_tenya) decides to speak to the dragon tamer . 
 What do you do ? Momo ($_momo) asks , earning herself another glare . 
 Shoto ($_shoto) removes himself ($_shoto) from the equation first , walking into one of the rooms with a nonchalant shrug . Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares from under his ($_katsuki) hood , leaning against the wall between the two doors . Tenya and Izuku ($_izuku) exchange looks , but ultimately nothing is settled until Momo ($_momo) emerges from her ($_izuku) room , arms crossed and a glare on her ($_izuku) face . 
 Night has fully fallen when they reach the next town , stars twinkling overhead , the moon casting a pale glow over the path . Momo ($_momo) rode ahead earlier to make reservations at the inn in the town , and her horse is tethered outside , marking the place they are to stay that night . Shoto ($_shoto) keeps a hood over his ($_shoto) head , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) also opts to cover his ($_shoto) face , just in case news of the dragon tamer has reached this town too . Momo ($_momo) sits at a table , and when they enter , she gets up and leads them to their rooms . She and Ochako ($_ochako) head into one room , the shorter girl already chattering about what happened since she left earlier . The other four stare at each other in silence - no one wants to make the decision about who sleeps in a room with Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
 We were sent here to kill your dragon , Momo ($_momo) intervenes , effectively changing the subject . 
 

($_kacchan)	Kacchan ($_kacchan) ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , taking a step closer to the dragon . Do you know who this is ? The boy atop the dragon looks around him , his eyes locking onto the green haired boy who was practically quaking in his boots . 
 We used to live in the same village . But then Kacchan ($_kacchan) got exiled , and ... Izuku ($_izuku) explains , eyes flitting between Katsuki ($_katsuki) and the rest of his ($_katsuki) group . 
 Don ($_don) t talk to royalty like that , Kacchan ($_kacchan) , Izuku ($_izuku) says quietly , and the blonde s head snaps round to him ($_izuku) , his ($_izuku) fierce glare intensifying . 
 

($_don)	Don ($_don) t be rude to her . 
 And why in the fuck would I do that ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asked , just as confused as everyone else as to why the roof would need to be broken . Don ($_don) t you live there ? Use the goddamn front door ! 
 Don ($_don) t talk to royalty like that , Kacchan ($_kacchan) , Izuku ($_izuku) says quietly , and the blonde s head snaps round to him ($_izuku) , his ($_izuku) fierce glare intensifying . 
 

($_katsuki)	There s no need to be rude , Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
 I m starting to wish I had done better in ignoring you too , Katsuki ($_katsuki) grumbles , and all Ochako can do is laugh . 
 Katsuki ($_katsuki) walks in silence for the next few hours , ignoring anyone when they spoke to him . The mindless chit chat that was happening between the other five - already such good friends - has no interest to him , and so he glares at the attempts . That is , until Ochako ($_ochako) falls in step with him . He spends the next thirty minutes constantly changing his speed , hoping that she ($_ochako) would eventually give up and go talk to someone else . However Ochako ($_ochako) was more stubborn than that , and she ($_ochako) matched his ($_ochako) annoying changes of pace with a smug expression on her ($_ochako) face , until Katsuki ($_katsuki) finally cracks and speaks to her ($_ochako) . 
 You , she ($_izuku) starts , jabbing a finger at Katsuki ($_katsuki) , need to grow up and stop huffing . You were given a job , you ll get payment , now stop acting like a child ! He turns on his heel and walks into the last empty room , muttering something that sounded like an apology to Momo on his way past . 
  She ($_izuku) sharply turns and opens the door to her ($_izuku) room , closing it behind her ($_izuku) with a loud bang . Tenya ($_tenya) and Izuku ($_izuku) stand frozen for a moment , before Izuku ($_izuku) sighs , and turns to follow where Shoto ($_shoto) went earlier . Tenya ($_tenya) has to take a deep breath before he ($_tenya) enters his ($_tenya) own room . Katsuki ($_katsuki) is lying on his ($_katsuki) bed , hands behind his ($_katsuki) head and his ($_katsuki) eyes closed .

Momo ($_momo) had said an apology , and loathe as he ($_momo) was to admit it , he ($_momo) was glad that she ($_izuku) had emerged from her ($_izuku) room to give them a much needed motherly scolding . Are we ever going to learn more about you ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , eyes trained on Katsuki ($_katsuki) . Like ... can I call you Bakugo ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) ? Kacchan ? 
 And don t pretend you re not sick of me already , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says , and Tenya ($_tenya) blinks . It s not that he ($_tenya) dislikes Katsuki , per se , but his ($_tenya) attitude annoys him ($_tenya) no end . Tenya ($_tenya) is a stickler for the rules , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) is anything but . Your silence confirms it , four eyes . 
 Like I give a shit ! He says , and Ochako ($_ochako) rolls her ($_ochako) eyes . She ($_ochako) thought she ($_ochako) might ve made some progress in trying to speak to him , but it s clear that he truly doesn t have any interest in making friends , so she ($_ochako) speeds up her ($_ochako) pace considerably to join up with Tenya and Momo ($_momo) .

It s almost dark by the time Tenya ($_tenya) decides to speak to the dragon tamer . 
 I ($_katsuki) ll say what I ($_katsuki) want ! 
 Well , shit , Katsuki ($_katsuki) says , rubbing the back of his ($_katsuki) neck , suddenly more docile . I ($_katsuki) guess if I ($_katsuki) don t answer your questions , you ll have me ($_katsuki) executed . 
 It s not that cold . Lord Explosion Murder is warm , so I ($_katsuki) stay warm . And I ($_katsuki) have money from working , like most people in the country . 
 I ($_katsuki) can pay you for another job , Shoto ($_shoto) says plainly , skipping to the main point of his ($_shoto) conversation . 
 I m older than you , four eyes ! Katsuki ($_katsuki) snaps , heading back towards his ($_katsuki) cave . 
 Well then , it s nice to meet you , Katsuki ($_katsuki) . My name is Ochako ($_ochako) . Ochako Uraraka . 
 Shoto ($_shoto) removes himself ($_shoto) from the equation first , walking into one of the rooms with a nonchalant shrug . Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares from under his ($_katsuki) hood , leaning against the wall between the two doors . Tenya and Izuku ($_izuku) exchange looks , but ultimately nothing is settled until Momo ($_momo) emerges from her ($_izuku) room , arms crossed and a glare on her ($_izuku) face . 
 Night has fully fallen when they reach the next town , stars twinkling overhead , the moon casting a pale glow over the path . Momo ($_momo) rode ahead earlier to make reservations at the inn in the town , and her horse is tethered outside , marking the place they are to stay that night .

 We used to live in the same village . But then Kacchan ($_kacchan) got exiled , and ... Izuku ($_izuku) explains , eyes flitting between Katsuki ($_katsuki) and the rest of his ($_katsuki) group . 
 We need the money , Ochako ($_ochako) pleads , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) shoots her ($_katsuki) a glare . 
 And why in the fuck would I do that ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) asked , just as confused as everyone else as to why the roof would need to be broken . Don ($_don) t you live there ? Use the goddamn front door ! 
 I ($_katsuki) need you to break the roof off the castle in the crown city . This statement earns a few raised eyebrows and a gasp from Ochako ($_ochako) . Shoto ($_shoto) has never explained what he ($_shoto) wants to do when they finally reach their goal , but this gives them a horrible idea of what the royal plans on doing . 
 Tell me ($_katsuki) what s going on , half-and-half , and I ($_katsuki) ll consider it . 
 It ll be worth your while . Though I ($_katsuki) won t be able to pay you until after the event . 
 And let me ($_katsuki) guess , I ($_katsuki) don t need to know . I m not doing it , then . I ($_katsuki) ain t about to be doing illegal shit because you tell me ($_katsuki) to ! 
 Where did I ask ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) spits in return , causing Tenya ($_tenya) to raise his ($_tenya) eyebrows . 
  Tenya ($_tenya) sighs loudly as Katsuki ($_katsuki) readies himself ($_tenya) to sleep , angrily brushing his ($_tenya) teeth and changing out of his ($_tenya) outlandish clothes into something comfier . He ($_tenya) lies down again , under the scratchy blanket provided by the inn . Tenya ($_tenya) follows the other s lead , deeming their short conversation effectively over . He ($_tenya) readies himself ($_tenya) from bed and blows the candle out . The two lie in darkness on opposite sides of the room , until Tenya ($_tenya) feels the need to open his ($_tenya) mouth once more to continue their conversation .  They walk in silence for a little longer , Katsuki ($_katsuki) mulling in his ($_katsuki) anger as Tenya ($_tenya) waits patiently for the boy to speak . Having asked Izuku ($_izuku) earlier , he ($_katsuki) knows that the boy is a little older than himself ($_katsuki) , and he ($_katsuki) was reportedly exiled from their village years ago . Tenya ($_tenya) s smart - he ($_katsuki) puts the pieces together and assumes that Katsuki ($_katsuki) is the child that the dragon took from the village that was supposedly destroyed by the same creature . Whether Katsuki ($_katsuki) truly was one of the mythical dragon tamers was another story , but Tenya ($_tenya) decides that that can wait until he ($_tenya) feels more integrated into the group . At the moment , everyone is treating the blond like a mercenary - he ($_tenya) s only there to be paid to destroy the roof of the castle .  Not the last one ! He roars . Ochako ($_ochako) smiles again , more of a smirk this time , and he huffs loudly . I guess ... I guess Katsuki ($_katsuki) is okay . Since you all call each other by your first names , apparently . 

($_bakugo)	Healing you , Ochako ($_ochako) explains , glaring at him ($_bakugo) . 
 Katsuki_Bakugo ($_bakugo) , he ($_bakugo) spits . And what the fuck do you think you re doing ? 
 

($_izuku)	Shoto ($_shoto) s very kind to take you in with us , you know , he ($_shoto) chastises . After your fight with Izuku ($_izuku) , I would have done no such thing . 
 With a sigh , Shoto ($_shoto) moves off , not particularly caring either way if the dragon tamer follows him ($_shoto) or not . Slowly , the rest of the group follow him ($_shoto) , Izuku ($_izuku) catching up to the Prince quickly , and Momo and Tenya ($_tenya) following behind on horseback . Ochako ($_ochako) takes up the position at the back of the group , and after a few minutes she ($_ochako) hears footsteps behind her ($_ochako) and turns to see Katsuki trudging along behind them , hand in his pockets . Lord Explosion Murder flies slowly overhead them , and Shoto ($_shoto) turns around with a smile to note that he s behind them . 
 You , she ($_izuku) starts , jabbing a finger at Katsuki ($_katsuki) , need to grow up and stop huffing . You were given a job , you ll get payment , now stop acting like a child ! He turns on his heel and walks into the last empty room , muttering something that sounded like an apology to Momo on his way past . 
  I m not finished ! She ($_izuku) all but yells . You three are treating him like some kind of criminal . I get that you have some kind of history with him , Izuku ($_izuku) , but there s absolutely no reason for you to be treating him like that , she ($_izuku) adds , raising her ($_izuku) eyebrows at Tenya ($_tenya) . You go in there , and you apologise to him , and you lie down and sleep like everyone else .  She ($_izuku) sharply turns and opens the door to her ($_izuku) room , closing it behind her ($_izuku) with a loud bang . Tenya ($_tenya) and Izuku ($_izuku) stand frozen for a moment , before Izuku ($_izuku) sighs , and turns to follow where Shoto ($_shoto) went earlier . Tenya ($_tenya) has to take a deep breath before he ($_tenya) enters his ($_tenya) own room .

Momo ($_momo) had said an apology , and loathe as he ($_momo) was to admit it , he ($_momo) was glad that she ($_izuku) had emerged from her ($_izuku) room to give them a much needed motherly scolding . It wasn t a question , more like a statement , and the boy produced an axe from seemingly out of nowhere , holding it towards the boy he called Deku ($_deku) . Izuku ($_izuku) shakily pulled out his ($_izuku) sword , not knowing what to do or where to look . The sandy haired boy advances slowly , and then strikes , and everyone else quickly backs off . Metal clashes against metal in a blindingly fast flurry of attacks , both combatants giving it their all for some unknown reason . Izuku ($_izuku) ends up on his ($_izuku) back , the dragon tamer s raw strength overcoming Izuku ($_izuku) . An axe is pointed at his ($_izuku) throat and for a split second everyone assumes Izuku ($_izuku) is a goner , until Shoto steps in the way , fire crackling in the palm of his ($_izuku) hand . 
 Who are you ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , healing staff already casting a green glow around the area to heal both his ($_ochako) and Izuku ($_izuku) s wounds . 
 Stop . With a snarl on his ($_izuku) face , Izuku ($_izuku) s assailant backs up , folding his ($_izuku) arms over his ($_izuku) chest . Shoto ($_shoto) holds out a hand to help Izuku ($_izuku) up , and everyone turns back to face the boy with the dragon . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) , how do you know this young man ? Tenya ($_tenya) asks . 
 Shoto ($_shoto) removes himself ($_shoto) from the equation first , walking into one of the rooms with a nonchalant shrug . Katsuki ($_katsuki) glares from under his ($_katsuki) hood , leaning against the wall between the two doors . Tenya and Izuku ($_izuku) exchange looks , but ultimately nothing is settled until Momo ($_momo) emerges from her ($_izuku) room , arms crossed and a glare on her ($_izuku) face . 
 We used to live in the same village . But then Kacchan ($_kacchan) got exiled , and ... Izuku ($_izuku) explains , eyes flitting between Katsuki ($_katsuki) and the rest of his ($_katsuki) group .

 Night has fully fallen when they reach the next town , stars twinkling overhead , the moon casting a pale glow over the path . Momo ($_momo) rode ahead earlier to make reservations at the inn in the town , and her horse is tethered outside , marking the place they are to stay that night . Shoto ($_shoto) keeps a hood over his ($_shoto) head , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) also opts to cover his ($_shoto) face , just in case news of the dragon tamer has reached this town too . Momo ($_momo) sits at a table , and when they enter , she gets up and leads them to their rooms . She and Ochako ($_ochako) head into one room , the shorter girl already chattering about what happened since she left earlier . The other four stare at each other in silence - no one wants to make the decision about who sleeps in a room with Katsuki ($_katsuki) . 
 How are you surviving out here ? Shoto ($_shoto) asks , curiosity getting the better of him ($_shoto) . Is it not really cold ? Do you have money ? Are you - 
 I m Shoto Todoroki , he ($_shoto) answers the fiery boy s questions , watching his ($_shoto) face morph into disbelief . 
 I ($_katsuki) need you to break the roof off the castle in the crown city . This statement earns a few raised eyebrows and a gasp from Ochako ($_ochako) . Shoto ($_shoto) has never explained what he ($_shoto) wants to do when they finally reach their goal , but this gives them a horrible idea of what the royal plans on doing .

 You ve ignored everyone else who has tried to speak to you , she ($_ochako) points out with a smile , and he visibly bristles , doing his best not to lose it at the mage who was clearly being purposely annoying . 
 Trying to get your attention , she ($_ochako) says sweetly , folding her ($_ochako) arms behind her ($_ochako) back . 
 Expensive rent ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , and he ($_ochako) shoots yet another death glare in her ($_ochako) direction . 
 Kacchan ($_kacchan) ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , taking a step closer to the dragon . Do you know who this is ? The boy atop the dragon looks around him , his eyes locking onto the green haired boy who was practically quaking in his boots . 
 Who are you ? Ochako ($_ochako) asks , healing staff already casting a green glow around the area to heal both his ($_ochako) and Izuku ($_izuku) s wounds .

It s not that he ($_tenya) dislikes Katsuki , per se , but his ($_tenya) attitude annoys him ($_tenya) no end . Tenya ($_tenya) is a stickler for the rules , and Katsuki ($_katsuki) is anything but . Your silence confirms it , four eyes . 
 A few hours later , when Ochako ($_ochako) complains that her ($_ochako) legs are sore from walking , Tenya ($_tenya) gives up his ($_tenya) horse to the girl and ends up walking . Ochako ($_ochako) strikes up a new animated conversation with Momo ($_momo) , and Tenya ($_tenya) finds himself ($_tenya) walking beside Katsuki ($_katsuki) . The blonde glares at him ($_tenya) , making his ($_tenya) intentions clear , but Tenya ($_tenya) staunchly keeps his ($_tenya) head facing forward , effectively ignoring the dragon tamer . It s almost dark by the time Tenya ($_tenya) decides to speak to the dragon tamer . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) , how do you know this young man ? Tenya ($_tenya) asks . 
 Where did I ask ? Katsuki ($_katsuki) spits in return , causing Tenya ($_tenya) to raise his ($_tenya) eyebrows . 
  Tenya ($_tenya) sighs loudly as Katsuki ($_katsuki) readies himself ($_tenya) to sleep , angrily brushing his ($_tenya) teeth and changing out of his ($_tenya) outlandish clothes into something comfier . He ($_tenya) lies down again , under the scratchy blanket provided by the inn . Tenya ($_tenya) follows the other s lead , deeming their short conversation effectively over . He ($_tenya) readies himself ($_tenya) from bed and blows the candle out . The two lie in darkness on opposite sides of the room , until Tenya ($_tenya) feels the need to open his ($_tenya) mouth once more to continue their conversation .  They walk in silence for a little longer , Katsuki ($_katsuki) mulling in his ($_katsuki) anger as Tenya ($_tenya) waits patiently for the boy to speak . Having asked Izuku ($_izuku) earlier , he ($_katsuki) knows that the boy is a little older than himself ($_katsuki) , and he ($_katsuki) was reportedly exiled from their village years ago . Tenya ($_tenya) s smart - he ($_katsuki) puts the pieces together and assumes that Katsuki ($_katsuki) is the child that the dragon took from the village that was supposedly destroyed by the same creature . Whether Katsuki ($_katsuki) truly was one of the mythical dragon tamers was another story , but Tenya ($_tenya) decides that that can wait until he ($_tenya) feels more integrated into the group . At the moment , everyone is treating the blond like a mercenary - he ($_tenya) s only there to be paid to destroy the roof of the castle . 

($_deku)	It wasn t a question , more like a statement , and the boy produced an axe from seemingly out of nowhere , holding it towards the boy he called Deku ($_deku) . Izuku ($_izuku) shakily pulled out his ($_izuku) sword , not knowing what to do or where to look . The sandy haired boy advances slowly , and then strikes , and everyone else quickly backs off . Metal clashes against metal in a blindingly fast flurry of attacks , both combatants giving it their all for some unknown reason . Izuku ($_izuku) ends up on his ($_izuku) back , the dragon tamer s raw strength overcoming Izuku ($_izuku) . An axe is pointed at his ($_izuku) throat and for a split second everyone assumes Izuku ($_izuku) is a goner , until Shoto steps in the way , fire crackling in the palm of his ($_izuku) hand . 
 Deku ($_deku) ! He cries , jumping from the back of the dragon . Why the fuck are you here ! 
 Shut it , Deku ($_deku) !
