($_momo)	 The tea shop in town is quiet . Gingham curtains line the windows , with lace curtains over the glass that hide the occupants of the cafe . Cake stands sit in the middle of each of the tables , piled high with cupcakes and scones and traybakes . There s a pastel coloured teapot , and cups and saucers that match , adorned with tiny flowers . Quiet music plays from a pianist in the corner , and Momo ($_momo) is in her ($_midoriya) element .  The two leave the cafe , Ochako ($_ochako) s tea still unfinished . Momo ($_momo) cautiously gets up from her ($_ochako) seat -LRB- after finishing her ($_ochako) slice of cake , of course -RRB- , and pays the shop owner , who still looks slightly bewildered at the whole affair . I m glad we managed to ditch the others , Momo ($_momo) muses , sipping her ($_midoriya) tea . 
 She ($_midoriya) s civil enough to only put one cake on her ($_midoriya) plate at a time , but she ($_midoriya) eats more than Ochako ($_ochako) within a few minutes . The_shorter_girl ($_midoriya) constantly has to remind her ($_midoriya) that it s not all you can eat , but Momo ($_momo) brushes her ($_midoriya) off , saying it s a treat . Cake was a luxury by everyone s standards - even in the royal palace , they only got cake on their birthdays , or on the very few occasions they were invited to banquets with the royal family . And truth be told , Momo ($_momo) had never tasted such a good cake in her ($_midoriya) life as she ($_midoriya) had in this coffee shop . 
 That makes sense , I ($_midoriya) suppose , Momo ($_momo) says , spearing a strawberry on her ($_ochako) fork . I ($_midoriya) guess ... well , while I ($_midoriya) get paid for my ($_midoriya) work as a retainer , I ($_midoriya) ve never had to pay for food or shelter in my ($_midoriya) life . I ($_midoriya) ve been able to save some money each month so that eventually , when Shoto ($_shoto) becomes king and gets properly trained guards , I ($_midoriya) can start my ($_midoriya) own life . My ($_midoriya) own family . 
  I won t be so easy to beat . In his ($_shoto) other hand he ($_shoto) holds a ball of fire , which he ($_shoto) sets off towards the_Knight_Slayer_like_a_flamethrower ($_the) . Caught up in the shock of the moment - the ever recognisable Shoto doesn t have his ($_shoto) hood up - the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) can t move . He ($_shoto) s burned , not to death , Izuku ($_izuku) prays , and Shoto ($_shoto) moves in while he ($_shoto) s down . With a rope that Tenya ($_tenya) recognises as being from Momo ($_momo) s horse , he ($_shoto) binds the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s wrists . The door of the caf swings violently open , ringing the bell . Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) look up from their tea at the man who stands on the welcome mat , out of breath and sweating . The woman who owns the tea shop goes over to him ($_izuku) , teapot in one hand and a plate of cake in the other . He ($_izuku) holds a hand up to her as he ($_izuku) catches his ($_izuku) breath , all eyes of the shop on him ($_izuku) . 
 That s. . . very wise. Very mature. Something that I ($_midoriya) wouldn t think of doing . You ve very noble , Ochako ($_ochako) Ochako_,_Momo ($_momo) commends , and the_girl ($_midoriya) flushes , pushing her ($_midoriya) fingers together and avoiding eye contact . 
 I ll go ! She ($_ochako) squeaks , abandoning Momo ($_momo) to pay the bill . Show me where ! 
 

($_don)	No ! Don ($_don) t move ! You ll only injure yourself more ! 
 Don ($_don) t talk either , the Knight Slayer hisses , and Tanya cringes at the harshness of his ($_don) voice . You re a knight , aren t you ? 
 Don ($_don) t move , was the only command that passed across the assailants lips , and Tenya ($_tenya) staunchly turned his ($_tenya) head back to its ($_tenya) original position . I said don t move ! 
 I ll be fine Izuku . Don ($_don) t worry about me . 
 Don ($_don) t encourage him ($_shoto) ! Izuku ($_izuku) says . Look , I don t think it s a good idea for you to go after someone you clearly hold strong feelings for on your own ! I don t want anything bad to happen to you . 
 

($_izuku)	My friend ... he ($_izuku) starts , a little out of breath . My friend caught the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) . But we need a doctor . And the ... police ? 
 I wish Shoto ($_shoto) were here , Izuku ($_izuku) says , nervously rubbing his ($_shoto) arm . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) , how are you going to fight him ($_shoto) on your own ? You only know self defence ! 
 Tenya ($_tenya) , I swear I won t let him ($_the) hurt you ! Izuku ($_izuku) says , and while his ($_izuku) voice is convincing , his ($_izuku) hands are shaking around his ($_izuku) sword , and Tenya ($_tenya) swears Izuku ($_izuku) s knees are trembling , though his ($_izuku) vision is beginning to blur and he ($_izuku) can t trust what he ($_izuku) sees . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) , stop ... 
  Such kind words , the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) sneers . He ($_izuku) draws another dagger from inside the long robes he ($_izuku) wears and dashes towards Izuku ($_izuku) . Surprisingly , Izuku ($_izuku) manages to knock the knife from his ($_izuku) hand and kick it in the direction of Tenya ($_tenya) , out of the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s reach . It s only then that Tenya ($_tenya) realises that self defence was probably the best thing to fight someone who was using knives . Izuku ($_izuku) s mother had probably trained him ($_izuku) in the exact ways to get the knife off his ($_izuku) assailant , he ($_izuku) assumes . It was probably a good thing - the both of them would be dead otherwise . Izuku ($_izuku) , you ($_izuku) don t need to kill or injure him ($_izuku) ! Just hold him ($_izuku) off , I m sure Shoto will be here soon ! 
 There s been a fight , he ($_izuku) says , still panting . We need a cleric . The ... the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) ! There s a chorus of audible gasps around the room , and Ochako ($_ochako) jumps to her ($_ochako) feet . 
 That s really not a good idea . He ($_shoto) s dangerous ; you could get killed ! Izuku ($_izuku) protests , hanging on to Tenya s arm as he ($_shoto) tries to walk away . Tenya ($_tenya) ! 
 Have you seen this guy ? Izuku ($_izuku) turns around to hand the poster to Tenya , only to find him staring at the same poster on the message board . 
 What are you going to do when - if - you find him ($_shoto) ? Izuku ($_izuku) asks hesitantly , scared of hearing the answer . 
  She ($_ochako) walks up the road a little way and spots Izuku ($_izuku) sitting on the side of the street . She ($_ochako) ducks down into the side alley where Shoto ($_shoto) is leaning against the wall . Ochako ($_ochako) is sitting in front of Tenya , healing staff aglow as she ($_ochako) closes up the wound in his arms , slowly pulling the blade out as he writes in pain . The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) is surrounded by police at the end of the alley , and as she ($_ochako) turns to Shoto , she ($_ochako) can only ask one thing . They look at him ($_izuku) confused for half a second , before one says he ($_izuku) ll go for the police and another goes to find a healer . Izuku ($_izuku) sits on the pavement , and one , who looks like a mother , sits beside him ($_izuku) , dabbing at the blood on his ($_izuku) face with her ($_izuku) handkerchief . 
  Izuku ($_izuku) can t comprehend what he ($_shoto) just saw . Both he ($_shoto) and Tenya ($_tenya) had trouble even standing up to the Knight Slayer - it was Tenya ($_tenya) s idea to find him ($_shoto) in the first place , it was Tenya ($_tenya) s revenge they were after . But yet it was Shoto that saved them , captured their target , took him ($_shoto) down in one attack . Tenya ($_tenya) was too tired to be worried about this , his ($_tenya) left arm still out of commission with the blade in it . Izuku ($_izuku) goes to the end of the street as Shoto finishes restraining the Knight Slayer , blood still dripping down his ($_izuku) face from the cut on his ($_izuku) forehead . There s a small group of people standing outside a cobbler , and they turn to him ($_izuku) , faces pale .  I won t be so easy to beat . In his ($_shoto) other hand he ($_shoto) holds a ball of fire , which he ($_shoto) sets off towards the_Knight_Slayer_like_a_flamethrower ($_the) . Caught up in the shock of the moment - the ever recognisable Shoto doesn t have his ($_shoto) hood up - the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) can t move . He ($_shoto) s burned , not to death , Izuku ($_izuku) prays , and Shoto ($_shoto) moves in while he ($_shoto) s down . With a rope that Tenya ($_tenya) recognises as being from Momo ($_momo) s horse , he ($_shoto) binds the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s wrists . As the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) bends over Izuku ($_izuku) to deliver the final blow , the boy s sword blade pointed towards the villain in one final stand , the air grows cold . Noting this , the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) slowly draws back . It s not natural , like a breeze , and he ($_the) can t tell what s going on . It s not something that either of those in front of him ($_the) is producing , and the confusion buys Izuku ($_izuku) enough time to get up on his ($_the) feet . 
 Orders received ! Izuku ($_izuku) squeaks , and soon the Knight Slayer dashes towards him ($_izuku) with an unrelenting flurry of attacks . Izuku ($_izuku) manages to hold him ($_izuku) off for a matter of minutes , but eventually loses his ($_izuku) balance when one of the knives comes a little too close to his ($_izuku) head , making a small cut at his ($_izuku) forehead but not enough to cause serious damage . Izuku ($_izuku) bends backwards to avoid the knife and loses his ($_izuku) balance , meeting the cobblestones uncomfortably . 
 I thought you said it d be okay ! The green haired boy says , and all Tenya can do in response is collapse a little further onto the ground . He doesn t think that Izuku ($_izuku) is a particularly good swordsman , not that he s ever seen him fight , but he has no one to put his trust in apart from him . 
 The door of the caf swings violently open , ringing the bell . Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) look up from their tea at the man who stands on the welcome mat , out of breath and sweating . The woman who owns the tea shop goes over to him ($_izuku) , teapot in one hand and a plate of cake in the other . He ($_izuku) holds a hand up to her as he ($_izuku) catches his ($_izuku) breath , all eyes of the shop on him ($_izuku) . 
 Not so big now , are we ? The Knight Slayer snarls , and Tenya ($_tenya) s eyes close , almost ready to accept his ($_tenya) fate . But then there s a clattering of shoes on the cobblestones , and suddenly Izuku ($_izuku) is hovering over Tenya ($_tenya) s body , his ($_izuku) sword blocking the other boy s body from the second dagger the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) produced . 
  Have you guys heard of this guy ? Izuku ($_izuku) asks , holding up a poster he ($_izuku) has ripped from the message board . On it is a hand drawn portrait , with a bounty underneath it . Criminals aren t often pinned up on these boards , unless they were dangerous . Izuku waves the parchment until Shoto ($_shoto) takes it from him ($_shoto) .  It takes Tenya ($_tenya) a long time to even get a hint as to the Knight Slayer s location . He ($_shoto) trawls the town for hours , walking down side alleys and weaving through the square , occasionally bumping into Izuku ($_izuku) and Shoto ($_shoto) , the latter of who barely gives him ($_shoto) a glance . Eventually , he ($_shoto) ends up on the far side of town , far away from their campsite and completely alone . On a tiny back street in a dark area , he ($_shoto) stops for a while , consulting the map that he ($_shoto) had managed to pick up on their first day in the town . He ($_shoto) can t quite figure out where he ($_shoto) is , but assuming that if he ($_shoto) continues on down the street , he ($_shoto) ll end up back on one of the main roads , he ($_shoto) tucks the map away and makes a few more strides down the street . Don ($_don) t encourage him ($_shoto) ! Izuku ($_izuku) says . Look , I don t think it s a good idea for you to go after someone you clearly hold strong feelings for on your own ! I don t want anything bad to happen to you . 
 That s not a good idea , Izuku ($_izuku) protests . 
 

($_shoto)	I wish Shoto ($_shoto) were here , Izuku ($_izuku) says , nervously rubbing his ($_shoto) arm . 
 I m sure he ($_shoto) ll arrive soon ... I ll go and see if I can find him ($_shoto) . 
 Izuku ($_izuku) , how are you going to fight him ($_shoto) on your own ? You only know self defence ! 
 The Knight Slayer , Shoto says suddenly . The name does ring a bell , now I think about it . There s been a warrant out for his ($_shoto) arrest for months . 
 It says here he ($_shoto) was spotted in town yesterday , Tenya ($_tenya) says . I want to find him ($_shoto) . 
 That s really not a good idea . He ($_shoto) s dangerous ; you could get killed ! Izuku ($_izuku) protests , hanging on to Tenya s arm as he ($_shoto) tries to walk away . Tenya ($_tenya) ! 
 Izuku , the entire reason I left the Central Kingdom was to find this_man ($_shoto) . My original plan was to set up base in the capital and work from there , gathering intel , but now the_man ($_shoto) has landed in my lap . 
 Yes , I have . In fact , I ve been looking for him ($_shoto) . 
 You ... you know him ($_shoto) ? 
 Not personally. I. . . he ($_shoto) killed my brother . 
 What are you going to do when - if - you find him ($_shoto) ? Izuku ($_izuku) asks hesitantly , scared of hearing the answer . 
 I won t kill him ($_shoto) , if that s what you re worried about . I just want to ... talk . 
  She ($_ochako) walks up the road a little way and spots Izuku ($_izuku) sitting on the side of the street . She ($_ochako) ducks down into the side alley where Shoto ($_shoto) is leaning against the wall . Ochako ($_ochako) is sitting in front of Tenya , healing staff aglow as she ($_ochako) closes up the wound in his arms , slowly pulling the blade out as he writes in pain .

He ($_shoto) s burned , not to death , Izuku ($_izuku) prays , and Shoto ($_shoto) moves in while he ($_shoto) s down . With a rope that Tenya ($_tenya) recognises as being from Momo ($_momo) s horse , he ($_shoto) binds the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s wrists . He ($_shoto) s stopped , however , by a heavy hand on his ($_shoto) shoulder , and Tenya ($_tenya) freezes . Whoever has stopped him ($_shoto) is breathing heavily , and he ($_shoto) can feel the hot air on his ($_shoto) ear . He ($_shoto) slowly turns his ($_shoto) head , not daring to move any other part of his ($_shoto) body . His ($_shoto) face contorts in fear when his ($_shoto) eyes meet those of his ($_shoto) attacker , the same man whose face was plastered over the message board in the town . 
 It s not them , a voice comes from the end of the alley . Shoto ($_shoto) stands there , with his ($_shoto) hand on the wall , ice slowly creeping towards the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) . 
 No . I ($_midoriya) don t recognise him ($_shoto) either . 
  Have you guys heard of this guy ? Izuku ($_izuku) asks , holding up a poster he ($_izuku) has ripped from the message board . On it is a hand drawn portrait , with a bounty underneath it . Criminals aren t often pinned up on these boards , unless they were dangerous . Izuku waves the parchment until Shoto ($_shoto) takes it from him ($_shoto) . We don t know where he ($_shoto) is , Shoto ($_shoto) points out . 
  It takes Tenya ($_tenya) a long time to even get a hint as to the Knight Slayer s location .

I don t want anything bad to happen to you . 
 It d be quicker , Shoto ($_shoto) says dryly . 
 Exactly my thoughts . We should split up and see if we can find him ($_shoto) . 
 

($_the)	My friend ... he ($_izuku) starts , a little out of breath . My friend caught the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) . But we need a doctor . And the ... police ? 
 ... correct , Tenya ($_tenya) answers with hesitation . He ($_the) s not quite sure how to react to the man s accusation , but telling a lie would only end in disaster . 
 A friend ? I ll have the pleasure of taking you down too , then . The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) draws back , now one weapon down , since Tenya ($_tenya) refuses to remove the blade from his ($_tenya) arm . 
 I m slowly wiping you out ... if I get you too , then I ll only have your father to deal with . He ($_the) licks his ($_the) lips and draws back , laughing to himself ($_the) . Oh , the worst family of knights will be gone ! It s only moments until the Iida family crumbles ! 
 Tenya ($_tenya) , I swear I won t let him ($_the) hurt you ! Izuku ($_izuku) says , and while his ($_izuku) voice is convincing , his ($_izuku) hands are shaking around his ($_izuku) sword , and Tenya ($_tenya) swears Izuku ($_izuku) s knees are trembling , though his ($_izuku) vision is beginning to blur and he ($_izuku) can t trust what he ($_izuku) sees .

There s a chorus of audible gasps around the room , and Ochako ($_ochako) jumps to her ($_ochako) feet . 
 Wait! The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) says , releasing his ($_the) grip on Tenya ($_tenya) to scoot round in front of him ($_the) . You re an Iida ! 
  She ($_ochako) walks up the road a little way and spots Izuku ($_izuku) sitting on the side of the street . She ($_ochako) ducks down into the side alley where Shoto ($_shoto) is leaning against the wall . Ochako ($_ochako) is sitting in front of Tenya , healing staff aglow as she ($_ochako) closes up the wound in his arms , slowly pulling the blade out as he writes in pain . The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) is surrounded by police at the end of the alley , and as she ($_ochako) turns to Shoto , she ($_ochako) can only ask one thing . An easy opponent then ? This will be a walk in the park , the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) says , relishing in the fear on his ($_the) two victim s faces . 
  I won t be so easy to beat . In his ($_shoto) other hand he ($_shoto) holds a ball of fire , which he ($_shoto) sets off towards the_Knight_Slayer_like_a_flamethrower ($_the) . Caught up in the shock of the moment - the ever recognisable Shoto doesn t have his ($_shoto) hood up - the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) can t move . He ($_shoto) s burned , not to death , Izuku ($_izuku) prays , and Shoto ($_shoto) moves in while he ($_shoto) s down . With a rope that Tenya ($_tenya) recognises as being from Momo ($_momo) s horse , he ($_shoto) binds the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s wrists . It s not them , a voice comes from the end of the alley . Shoto ($_shoto) stands there , with his ($_shoto) hand on the wall , ice slowly creeping towards the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) . 
 What s going on ? The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) hisses . What are you doing ? If you re trying to confuse me , it won t work ! 
 As the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) bends over Izuku ($_izuku) to deliver the final blow , the boy s sword blade pointed towards the villain in one final stand , the air grows cold . Noting this , the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) slowly draws back . It s not natural , like a breeze , and he ($_the) can t tell what s going on .

But then there s a clattering of shoes on the cobblestones , and suddenly Izuku ($_izuku) is hovering over Tenya ($_tenya) s body , his ($_izuku) sword blocking the other boy s body from the second dagger the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) produced . 
  Because he ruined my life ! The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) yells , pulling the dagger away and moving in again for the kill . But Tenya ($_tenya) is faster than him , and in one fluid movement his sword is drawn and clatters against the metal of the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s knife . Oh? Is this how we re going to play it ?  They exchange blows back and forth , each one being dodged or blocked or parried by the other . Both of them are evenly matched - with Tenya ($_tenya) s weapon being better , yet_the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s mobility made easier by his ($_the) lack of heavy armour .  Beads of sweat appear on Tenya ($_tenya) s forehead - he ($_the) wasn t prepared for a fight , not really , and he ($_the) doesn t have time to wipe them away . His ($_the) only moment to breathe comes when the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) slides on the ground and kicks Tenya ($_tenya) s feet out from underneath him ($_the) , and he ($_the) lands hard on his ($_the) back on the cobblestones . The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) aims , and throws the dagger towards Tenya ($_tenya) s heart . His ($_the) arm instinctively moves up to block it , but the knife embeds itself in his ($_the) skin , causing the dark haired boy to scream out in pain . 

($_midoriya)	 The tea shop in town is quiet . Gingham curtains line the windows , with lace curtains over the glass that hide the occupants of the cafe . Cake stands sit in the middle of each of the tables , piled high with cupcakes and scones and traybakes . There s a pastel coloured teapot , and cups and saucers that match , adorned with tiny flowers . Quiet music plays from a pianist in the corner , and Momo ($_momo) is in her ($_midoriya) element . I m glad we managed to ditch the others , Momo ($_momo) muses , sipping her ($_midoriya) tea . 
 She ($_midoriya) s civil enough to only put one cake on her ($_midoriya) plate at a time , but she ($_midoriya) eats more than Ochako ($_ochako) within a few minutes . The_shorter_girl ($_midoriya) constantly has to remind her ($_midoriya) that it s not all you can eat , but Momo ($_momo) brushes her ($_midoriya) off , saying it s a treat . Cake was a luxury by everyone s standards - even in the royal palace , they only got cake on their birthdays , or on the very few occasions they were invited to banquets with the royal family . And truth be told , Momo ($_momo) had never tasted such a good cake in her ($_midoriya) life as she ($_midoriya) had in this coffee shop . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) said he ($_midoriya) was going to look at the notice board again . I ($_midoriya) have no idea why he ($_midoriya) does that so often . It seems to be an obsession . 
 That makes sense , I ($_midoriya) suppose , Momo ($_momo) says , spearing a strawberry on her ($_ochako) fork . I ($_midoriya) guess ... well , while I ($_midoriya) get paid for my ($_midoriya) work as a retainer , I ($_midoriya) ve never had to pay for food or shelter in my ($_midoriya) life . I ($_midoriya) ve been able to save some money each month so that eventually , when Shoto ($_shoto) becomes king and gets properly trained guards , I ($_midoriya) can start my ($_midoriya) own life . My ($_midoriya) own family . 
 Well , he ($_midoriya) doesn t come from money , and I ($_midoriya) think he ($_midoriya) must have been raised to work hard and earn his ($_midoriya) money so that he ($_midoriya) can live as comfortable a life he ($_midoriya) can , Ochako ($_ochako) points out . 
 That s. . . very wise. Very mature. Something that I ($_midoriya) wouldn t think of doing . You ve very noble , Ochako ($_ochako) Ochako_,_Momo ($_momo) commends , and the_girl ($_midoriya) flushes , pushing her ($_midoriya) fingers together and avoiding eye contact . 
  That sounds nice . I ($_midoriya) can t wait to be able to make more money . That s why I ($_midoriya) m travelling to the capital - there ; I ($_midoriya) can get a good job . At least , that s what I ($_midoriya) ve heard . There s not many jobs in the Western Kingdom . Then , I ($_midoriya) can send money back to my ($_midoriya) parents so that they can live a more comfortable life . You re the first person to say that to me ($_midoriya) . The girls in my ($_midoriya) village made fun of me ($_midoriya) for wanting to leave . In my ($_midoriya) village , many people were magic users - there was a school for mages , but my ($_midoriya) parents couldn t afford to send me ($_midoriya) . I ($_midoriya) have to teach myself ($_midoriya) , if I ($_midoriya) want to get better . 
 If you ever get injured , please , come to me ($_midoriya) , and I ($_midoriya) ll get you sorted out in no time . Perhaps ... perhaps you could help me ($_midoriya) train in offensive magic one day too . I ($_midoriya) know you re not an expert in the area , but I ($_midoriya) m sure you could help me ($_midoriya) . 
 No . I ($_midoriya) don t recognise him ($_shoto) either . 
 

($_ochako)	There s been a fight , he ($_izuku) says , still panting . We need a cleric . The ... the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) ! There s a chorus of audible gasps around the room , and Ochako ($_ochako) jumps to her ($_ochako) feet . 
  The two leave the cafe , Ochako ($_ochako) s tea still unfinished . Momo ($_momo) cautiously gets up from her ($_ochako) seat -LRB- after finishing her ($_ochako) slice of cake , of course -RRB- , and pays the shop owner , who still looks slightly bewildered at the whole affair .  She ($_ochako) has no idea which way_Ochako ($_ochako) headed , but judging by the way many people are hovering around the side streets , she ($_ochako) assumes it s nearby .  She ($_ochako) walks up the road a little way and spots Izuku ($_izuku) sitting on the side of the street . She ($_ochako) ducks down into the side alley where Shoto ($_shoto) is leaning against the wall . Ochako ($_ochako) is sitting in front of Tenya , healing staff aglow as she ($_ochako) closes up the wound in his arms , slowly pulling the blade out as he writes in pain .

 That makes sense , I ($_midoriya) suppose , Momo ($_momo) says , spearing a strawberry on her ($_ochako) fork . I ($_midoriya) guess ... well , while I ($_midoriya) get paid for my ($_midoriya) work as a retainer , I ($_midoriya) ve never had to pay for food or shelter in my ($_midoriya) life . I ($_midoriya) ve been able to save some money each month so that eventually , when Shoto ($_shoto) becomes king and gets properly trained guards , I ($_midoriya) can start my ($_midoriya) own life . My ($_midoriya) own family . 
 Well , he ($_midoriya) doesn t come from money , and I ($_midoriya) think he ($_midoriya) must have been raised to work hard and earn his ($_midoriya) money so that he ($_midoriya) can live as comfortable a life he ($_midoriya) can , Ochako ($_ochako) points out . 
 The door of the caf swings violently open , ringing the bell . Ochako ($_ochako) and Momo ($_momo) look up from their tea at the man who stands on the welcome mat , out of breath and sweating . The woman who owns the tea shop goes over to him ($_izuku) , teapot in one hand and a plate of cake in the other . He ($_izuku) holds a hand up to her as he ($_izuku) catches his ($_izuku) breath , all eyes of the shop on him ($_izuku) . 
 That s. . . very wise. Very mature. Something that I ($_midoriya) wouldn t think of doing . You ve very noble , Ochako ($_ochako) Ochako_,_Momo ($_momo) commends , and the_girl ($_midoriya) flushes , pushing her ($_midoriya) fingers together and avoiding eye contact . 
 I d be honoured , Ochako ($_ochako) . 
 I ll go ! She ($_ochako) squeaks , abandoning Momo ($_momo) to pay the bill . Show me where ! 
 

($_technically)	Technically ($_technically) , Tenya ($_tenya) says . 
 Technically ($_technically) ? What do you mean ? You either are or you aren t. 
 

($_tenya)	That s still to be determined . I haven t made any decisions about my future . And why do you hate King Toshinori so much ? Tenya ($_tenya) asks , keeping eye contact with the taller man as his hand makes his way to the hilt of his sword . 
 Technically ($_technically) , Tenya ($_tenya) says . 
 ... correct , Tenya ($_tenya) answers with hesitation . He ($_the) s not quite sure how to react to the man s accusation , but telling a lie would only end in disaster . 
 A friend ? I ll have the pleasure of taking you down too , then . The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) draws back , now one weapon down , since Tenya ($_tenya) refuses to remove the blade from his ($_tenya) arm . 
 Tenya ($_tenya) , I swear I won t let him ($_the) hurt you ! Izuku ($_izuku) says , and while his ($_izuku) voice is convincing , his ($_izuku) hands are shaking around his ($_izuku) sword , and Tenya ($_tenya) swears Izuku ($_izuku) s knees are trembling , though his ($_izuku) vision is beginning to blur and he ($_izuku) can t trust what he ($_izuku) sees . 
  Such kind words , the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) sneers . He ($_izuku) draws another dagger from inside the long robes he ($_izuku) wears and dashes towards Izuku ($_izuku) . Surprisingly , Izuku ($_izuku) manages to knock the knife from his ($_izuku) hand and kick it in the direction of Tenya ($_tenya) , out of the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s reach . It s only then that Tenya ($_tenya) realises that self defence was probably the best thing to fight someone who was using knives . Izuku ($_izuku) s mother had probably trained him ($_izuku) in the exact ways to get the knife off his ($_izuku) assailant , he ($_izuku) assumes . It was probably a good thing - the both of them would be dead otherwise . It says here he ($_shoto) was spotted in town yesterday , Tenya ($_tenya) says . I want to find him ($_shoto) . 
 That s really not a good idea . He ($_shoto) s dangerous ; you could get killed ! Izuku ($_izuku) protests , hanging on to Tenya s arm as he ($_shoto) tries to walk away . Tenya ($_tenya) ! 
 Wait! The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) says , releasing his ($_the) grip on Tenya ($_tenya) to scoot round in front of him ($_the) . You re an Iida ! 
 Don ($_don) t move , was the only command that passed across the assailants lips , and Tenya ($_tenya) staunchly turned his ($_tenya) head back to its ($_tenya) original position . I said don t move ! 
  Izuku ($_izuku) can t comprehend what he ($_shoto) just saw . Both he ($_shoto) and Tenya ($_tenya) had trouble even standing up to the Knight Slayer - it was Tenya ($_tenya) s idea to find him ($_shoto) in the first place , it was Tenya ($_tenya) s revenge they were after . But yet it was Shoto that saved them , captured their target , took him ($_shoto) down in one attack . Tenya ($_tenya) was too tired to be worried about this , his ($_tenya) left arm still out of commission with the blade in it . Izuku ($_izuku) goes to the end of the street as Shoto finishes restraining the Knight Slayer , blood still dripping down his ($_izuku) face from the cut on his ($_izuku) forehead . There s a small group of people standing outside a cobbler , and they turn to him ($_izuku) , faces pale .  I won t be so easy to beat . In his ($_shoto) other hand he ($_shoto) holds a ball of fire , which he ($_shoto) sets off towards the_Knight_Slayer_like_a_flamethrower ($_the) . Caught up in the shock of the moment - the ever recognisable Shoto doesn t have his ($_shoto) hood up - the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) can t move . He ($_shoto) s burned , not to death , Izuku ($_izuku) prays , and Shoto ($_shoto) moves in while he ($_shoto) s down . With a rope that Tenya ($_tenya) recognises as being from Momo ($_momo) s horse , he ($_shoto) binds the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s wrists . He ($_shoto) s stopped , however , by a heavy hand on his ($_shoto) shoulder , and Tenya ($_tenya) freezes . Whoever has stopped him ($_shoto) is breathing heavily , and he ($_shoto) can feel the hot air on his ($_shoto) ear . He ($_shoto) slowly turns his ($_shoto) head , not daring to move any other part of his ($_shoto) body . His ($_shoto) face contorts in fear when his ($_shoto) eyes meet those of his ($_shoto) attacker , the same man whose face was plastered over the message board in the town . 
 Not so big now , are we ? The Knight Slayer snarls , and Tenya ($_tenya) s eyes close , almost ready to accept his ($_tenya) fate . But then there s a clattering of shoes on the cobblestones , and suddenly Izuku ($_izuku) is hovering over Tenya ($_tenya) s body , his ($_izuku) sword blocking the other boy s body from the second dagger the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) produced . 
 Tenya ($_tenya) ? 
  It takes Tenya ($_tenya) a long time to even get a hint as to the Knight Slayer s location . He ($_shoto) trawls the town for hours , walking down side alleys and weaving through the square , occasionally bumping into Izuku ($_izuku) and Shoto ($_shoto) , the latter of who barely gives him ($_shoto) a glance . Eventually , he ($_shoto) ends up on the far side of town , far away from their campsite and completely alone . On a tiny back street in a dark area , he ($_shoto) stops for a while , consulting the map that he ($_shoto) had managed to pick up on their first day in the town . He ($_shoto) can t quite figure out where he ($_shoto) is , but assuming that if he ($_shoto) continues on down the street , he ($_shoto) ll end up back on one of the main roads , he ($_shoto) tucks the map away and makes a few more strides down the street .  Because he ruined my life ! The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) yells , pulling the dagger away and moving in again for the kill . But Tenya ($_tenya) is faster than him , and in one fluid movement his sword is drawn and clatters against the metal of the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s knife . Oh? Is this how we re going to play it ?  They exchange blows back and forth , each one being dodged or blocked or parried by the other . Both of them are evenly matched - with Tenya ($_tenya) s weapon being better , yet_the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) s mobility made easier by his ($_the) lack of heavy armour .  Beads of sweat appear on Tenya ($_tenya) s forehead - he ($_the) wasn t prepared for a fight , not really , and he ($_the) doesn t have time to wipe them away . His ($_the) only moment to breathe comes when the_Knight_Slayer ($_the) slides on the ground and kicks Tenya ($_tenya) s feet out from underneath him ($_the) , and he ($_the) lands hard on his ($_the) back on the cobblestones . The_Knight_Slayer ($_the) aims , and throws the dagger towards Tenya ($_tenya) s heart . His ($_the) arm instinctively moves up to block it , but the knife embeds itself in his ($_the) skin , causing the dark haired boy to scream out in pain .
