($_midoriya)	I deserved it . Eijirou ($_eijirou) s eyes snap up from the coffee cup to stare at Midoriya ($_midoriya) whose still giving this soft little smile . You shouldn t blame him ($_bakugou) for anything he ($_bakugou) did . He ($_bakugou) has his ($_bakugou) reasons . So soft and nice and way too kind . 
  Midoriya ($_midoriya) just keeps on smiling , doesn t argue but Eijirou ($_eijirou) is pretty sure he ($_eijirou) didn t even put a dent in the knight s thinking . A pause before red eyes flicker around the empty cafe and then , Why were you expecting him ($_eijirou) to show up ? He ($_eijirou) doesn t say , I thought I d never see him ($_eijirou) again . Doesn t add in I think he ($_eijirou) hates me . Doesn t say anything else and just waits . The smile finally falls from Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , eyes shifting and then - 
  Ah . I m sorry if I kept that from you . I wasn t thinking - I thought you didn t know about Bakugou ($_bakugou) still . There s this soft smile with closed green eyes and Eijirou ($_eijirou) honestly finds it hard to judge or blame - especially when it wasn t even Midoriya ($_midoriya) that caused anything . No , that was Bakugou ($_bakugou) . Bakugou ($_bakugou) was the one who started everything and destroyed everything . A little snort escapes him ($_bakugou) , a bitter smile crossing Eijirou ($_eijirou) s lips and he ($_bakugou) goes , Kacchan . Midoriya ($_midoriya) doesn t even sound surprised , actually if Eijirou ($_eijirou) wasn t mistaken the knight sounded happy . He ($_midoriya) didn t know how someone could greet Bakugou ($_bakugou) with honest happiness , especially after the rough greeting - if it could even be called that . I was wondering when you would show up . 
  There s a shove , his wrist being slammed into his chest before the harsh grasp is released but otherwise Bakugou ($_bakugou) pays him no attention - crimson eyes glaring death at one smiling Midoriya ($_midoriya) . Leave him the fuck alone and go fuck off else where . Don ($_don) t you ($_don) have some fucking asshole you ($_don) should be babysitting ? Before he ($_don) fucking dies ? The grin is cruel and sharp . Aimed to hurt and Midoriya ($_midoriya) is flinching back as the words strike home , his ($_don) bright smile fading to horror . The ashen haired man sneers , lips in this awful curl as his eyes burn Midoriya ($_midoriya) alive . I m sure you fucking were Deku . His grip tightens and Eijirou ($_eijirou) hurts , feels his bones rub against themselves and he s letting out a hitched gasp , followed by , Shi - dude . Ow - Stop - 
 What - You ($_don) didn t - He ($_don) s fine . He ($_don) s fine , I d know if - The words are frantic , ending in mumbles and green eyes are just getting smaller and smaller as Midoriya ($_midoriya) s entire frame starts trembling . It s a breakdown , some horrible kind of break down and Eijirou ($_eijirou) can see it from a mile way - has experienced it before so he ($_don) knows . He ($_don) knows and he ($_don) s reaching out to comfort and let the knight knows he ($_don) s not alone but - 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) is still mumbling , a hand crushed against his ($_eijirou) mouth and his ($_eijirou) entire body is trembling . He ($_eijirou) looks haunted , eyes impossibly wide and face this pale little thing and it s like he ($_eijirou) s reliving a nightmare . And Eijirou ($_eijirou) knows how that is - he ($_eijirou) knows so damn much that it hurts and - 
 - needs magic and I don t have any because it s mine and - Midoriya ($_midoriya) is reaching out and - 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) s in between them with Midoriya ($_midoriya) crumbled on the floor with frozen breathe . Not moving and Eijirou ($_eijirou) is mimicking him ($_eijirou) behind the raging inferno that was Bakugou ($_bakugou) . 
 Midoriya ($_midoriya) is blinking , the nightmare slowly receding and he ($_eijirou) gives the weakest smile and says -

 Bakugou ($_bakugou) is there , apparently reminded of Eijirou ($_eijirou) s existence when he ($_don) goes to move and the burning grip is back and he ($_don) s being shoved away as hissed words ring through the air , What the fuck are you ($_don) doing ? Of all fucking people - of all the fucking people in the fucking world - God , you ($_don) are such a fucking dumbass . A harsher shove and Eijirou ($_eijirou) s feet are stumbling back , his ($_eijirou) eyes are wide and he ($_eijirou) s lost . 
  Bakugou , suddenly there , living , breathing , and a force to be reckoned with . Anger and fumes , a fire that doesn t know when to quit with smoke suffocating everyone around him ($_eijirou) . He ($_eijirou) s there and - he ($_eijirou) knows . He ($_eijirou) knows too because he ($_eijirou) said those words with purpose . He ($_eijirou) said them with the intention to hurt and break . And he ($_eijirou) doesn t care that they work , doesn t give the slightest thought to the breaking apart knight and all his ($_eijirou) burning attention is on Eijirou ($_eijirou) - Midoriya ($_midoriya) is still mumbling , a hand crushed against his ($_eijirou) mouth and his ($_eijirou) entire body is trembling . He ($_eijirou) looks haunted , eyes impossibly wide and face this pale little thing and it s like he ($_eijirou) s reliving a nightmare . And Eijirou ($_eijirou) knows how that is - he ($_eijirou) knows so damn much that it hurts and - 
 To get what he ($_eijirou) wants , always to get what he ($_eijirou) wants , he ($_eijirou) doesn t care about anything else as long as he ($_eijirou) gets what he ($_eijirou) wants . Eijirou ($_eijirou) isn t exactly sure what that is , never had the slightest clue what it was the other man wanted he ($_eijirou) just - he ($_eijirou) was just shoved and pushed into following even though he ($_eijirou) didn t want to . Even though it made him ($_eijirou) lose his ($_eijirou) home . 
 He ($_eijirou) shoves back in a heartbeat , frozen hands slamming into a too warm chest and Eijirou ($_eijirou) is moving forward with his ($_eijirou) shoulder bumping into Bakugou ($_bakugou) with a vengeance . He ($_eijirou) s reaching out when horrified eyes snap to look up at him ($_eijirou) and - 
 Don ($_don) t fucking touch him ($_eijirou) . The words are this growl , low and dangerous . Something that sends shivers running up Eijirou ($_eijirou) spine and makes him ($_eijirou) want to run . 
 Bakugou ($_bakugou) s in between them with Midoriya ($_midoriya) crumbled on the floor with frozen breathe . Not moving and Eijirou ($_eijirou) is mimicking him ($_eijirou) behind the raging inferno that was Bakugou ($_bakugou) .

($_bakugou)	He ($_bakugou) can still see that cruel , feral grin if he ($_bakugou) closes his ($_bakugou) eyes .

It hurts to think that was who he ($_bakugou) had trusted him ($_bakugou) life with , who he ($_bakugou) seemed to be stuck with and he ($_bakugou) doesn t even understand why .
