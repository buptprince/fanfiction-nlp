($_every)	After their runs , they ate a small breakfast , and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) spent the rest of his ($_shouto) morning writing . He ($_shouto) wrote dozens of letters every_day ($_every) , surely to friends and family and concerned citizens . The chambermaids would enter at some point in the morning to dress Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) and fix his ($_shouto) hair , sometimes leaving it down and sweeping it back and sometimes piling it on top of his ($_shouto) head with the tiniest of braids woven in the red and white . Rarer were ponytails or single braids down his ($_shouto) back , and rarer still was the half-up bun , a style only for his ($_shouto) most casual of days , when Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) would lounge in his ($_shouto) robe half the day and peruse Skynet on his ($_shouto) machine in the computing room . 
  I ve been running faster every_day ($_every) . I m not even really trying to get away , I m just impressed , I suppose . Inasa ($_inasa) grinned , in spite of himself ($_shouto) . A lifetime of farmwork could impress a prince with a lifetime of combat training . 

($_momo)	 Just so you know , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , gesturing with a hand to the door . Momo ($_momo) isn t permitted to enter my bed chambers until , ah , until our wedding night . So you don t have to , well , you don t have to worry about any of that . He ($_shouto) stumbled through his ($_shouto) words , breaking his ($_shouto) eye contact . Inasa ($_inasa) just nodded , internally sighing in relief . The king wishes for it to be as soon as possible . Momo ($_momo) s planet is currently at war , so we are hoping to postpone it until she can finish all the diplomatic work she is doing for the royal family . The king believes - his voice dipped bitterly - that as soon as he purchased her to be my bride , she gave up her responsibility to her home planet and swore herself to be mine . He ll likely get his way in a year or so , if the war doesn t end . 
 

($_sir)	I m very sorry , sir ($_sir) , the_prince ($_shouto) said , keeping his ($_shouto) voice calm and holding the side of the table . I m going to have to cut our meeting short today . Thank you for the wedding gift . Now please , if you d leave me . 
 Ah , thank you , sir ($_sir) . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) peered into the basket . 
 

($_system)	Ah , well , yes , Your Highness . Surely you ve heard the news about King Endeavor wanting to annex a planet in System_8 ($_system) ? The_Earl ($_the) looked nervous . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) looked furious . 
 System 8 ? He ($_shouto) asked , his ($_shouto) voice level but angry . System_8 ($_system) , as in King All Might s system ? 
 

($_chambermaids)	A gift for us as well ! another chimed in , causing another bout of titters . Inasa ($_inasa) found himself wondering how the hierarchy worked around here , if the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) could openly speak to the prince in such a manner . 
 My , Your Highness , the king has gotten you a gift , one of the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) said shamelessly , raking her eyes over Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 Chambermaids ($_chambermaids) , it turned out , were what disrupted their ($_chambermaids) long period of silence . The door opened to a small group of them ($_chambermaids) , chattering as they ($_chambermaids) entered . Inasa ($_inasa) stood and they ($_chambermaids) greeted him ($_inasa) , tittering amongst themselves ($_chambermaids) . 
 The_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) left as soon as they ($_chambermaids) were finished , folding Prince Shouto s robe and exiting the door with a small golden key . 
 There were more giggles , and more whispers to Prince Shouto . Inasa ($_inasa) stayed put , standing by the chair as the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) slipped off his robe . He wasn t watching , but it ($_inasa) was impossible not to notice how the markings continued onto his back , his entire upper half decorated with impossibly detailed patterns , ancient prayers , and iconography . 
 The_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) sang quietly as they ($_chambermaids) dressed Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , covering him with layers , tying and wrapping and buttoning him into his dinner wear . He stood passively as they ($_chambermaids) dressed him , the task mundane to him . Inasa ($_inasa) realized this ($_inasa) must ve been a normal task for him , the chambermaids possibly the same chambermaids that had dressed him since birth . 
 Does the watchdog have a name ? one of the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) asked , turning from the_prince_to_look_at_Inasa ($_shouto) Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 

($_creati)	 Sir Inasa , this is my betrothed , Duchess Momo Yaoyorozu of Creati ($_creati) . We attended academy together and King Endeavor thought it to be a good match . Duchess Momo , this is my new bodyguard , Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said in introduction . Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) held her ($_duchess) hand out daintily and Inasa ($_inasa) gave it a perfunctory kiss . Creati ($_creati) was a planet in Inasa ($_inasa) s home planet s system , ore-rich land making them the manufacturing center of their system . Inasa ($_inasa) had done trade with them many times in his life . Ah , Inasa ($_inasa) said . A marriage of convenience , just like King_Endeavor ($_king) s own . His friend from school that the king had deemed to be the most advantageous ally , what with the boundless raw materials of Creati ($_creati) , the deal likely struck before they graduated . He wondered if Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) loved her . 
 

($_huh)	 Huh ($_huh) ? No ? Inasa ($_inasa) s face fell , at which Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , why ? Do you need me to go to the mailroom for some rea-oh . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) paused as he ($_shouto) realized why Inasa ($_inasa) has asked the question . You can t go alone , can you , watchdog ? Inasa ($_inasa) shook his ($_inasa) head . He ($_inasa) wasn t allowed to leave the_prince ($_shouto) s side except to bathe ; the only chance he ($_inasa) d have to mail his ($_inasa) compensation was when Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) decided to go to the mailroom . Huh ($_huh) ? 
 

($_god)	 There were kings on every planet surrounding every star in their galaxy , but none were as notorious as King_Endeavor ($_king) . He ($_god) was a God , literally . He ($_god) was known as a harsh king , but popular to the Sun God worshippers who were under the rule of one of the icons they had prayed to for generations before he ($_god) appeared in the flesh to lead them . They were blinded by the light of the Sun God flame . The rest of the galaxy knew better than to deal too often with him ($_god) , for fear of getting burned . It was said , at the very least . A million legends surrounded the angry red mark on Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s face . He ($_god) was shielded from the world until he ($_god) was fifteen and sent to academy , at which point his ($_god) appearance was revealed to the world and rumors of the scar spread through the galaxy . Even to his ($_god) classmates was Prince Shouto tight-lipped about his ($_god) life . Stories , myths , and gossip about his ($_god) family spilled forth from both the school and the loose-lipped people of the moon clan planet . 
 He ($_shouto) allowed Rei ($_rei) to return home once a year to visit her family . Rei ($_rei) brought Shouto ($_shouto) with her ($_shouto) one year after a few hours of begging . Shouto ($_shouto) clinged to her ($_shouto) leg and barely spoke to his estranged siblings , hiding behind Rei ($_rei) as she ($_shouto) spoke in low tones to her ($_shouto) mother over the flame in the town square . As she ($_shouto) boiled a cup of water for tea , it was said that she ($_shouto) , disgusted at the sight of her ($_shouto) own son s Sun God ($_god) half , tipped the boiling water into his ($_god) face . 
 Your mother is right . His ($_god) father nodded . Farming is a quiet life , but it s respectable and fulfilling . You have a talent for your work , Inasa ($_inasa) , and we need your help . Don t leave . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) , why throw your life away for that_tyrant ($_god) ?! his ($_god) mother exclaimed , rushing to him ($_god) and grabbing his ($_god) arm . 
 Who will do the planting and cast away the storms with you gone ? I m too frail to return to work , his ($_god) mother added . 
 These legends , stories Inasa ($_inasa) had heard over and over growing up , were why his ($_god) parents were so incredulous when he ($_god) walked in from the fields one afternoon , hung up his ($_god) hat , and announced he ($_god) was leaving home to work for King_Endeavor ($_king) . 
 

($_don)	Don ($_don) t worry , he ($_don) barred all the windows in my chambers years ago . I was rebellious even before I went to school . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) crossed the room to the entrance to the bathroom , shutting the door behind him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) looked around and found that the windows were indeed barred off . 
 

($_inasa)	What??? was that, anyway? the_prince ($_shouto) said as they walked back to his ($_shouto) chambers , pantomiming Inasa ($_inasa) s hands , referencing the wind power . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) looked at him ($_shouto) carefully but didn t say anything else . 
 Ah . I come from a planet with intense storms year-round , but our main industry is agriculture . The ability to manipulate wind evolved in our people to help with our work , Inasa ($_inasa) explained . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) entered the chambers , not knowing what to expect . As his ($_inasa) eyes adjusted to the low light of the chambers , he ($_inasa) saw Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , sitting on his ($_inasa) bed in the center of the room , and Inasa ($_inasa) had to hold his ($_inasa) breath to prevent himself ($_inasa) from gasping because - 
 There were no photos of the_prince ($_shouto) , no recorded images available to the public -LRB- not that Inasa ($_inasa) had any means of accessing the Skynet connective systems that people in the galaxy used to share information , his ($_inasa) family too poor to own any computing technology -RRB- . All information about him ($_inasa) spread by word-of-mouth , quickened by the notoriety of the family . 
 The half-red and half-white hair was to be expected , but its cascading length and brilliant shine were not . It fell past his ($_inasa) shoulders , straight as an arrow , to his ($_inasa) chest . 
 King_Endeavor ($_king) considered him ($_shouto) for a moment as they ($_king) approached a set of massive ebony doors at the end of a long passageway . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers , Inasa ($_inasa) thought , marveling at the dark wood and the intricate designs carved into its ($_king) surface . 
  Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , King_Endeavor ($_king) said after a long pause . I ($_shouto) am expecting a war to begin in the near future .  He is sure to be targeted by enemies . He is the only heir I ($_shouto) have . Inasa ($_inasa) nodded , stories of the exiled three children caught in his throat . His ($_inasa) bare chest , revealed by the robe that was falling open around his ($_inasa) torso . He ($_inasa) was covered in markings , symbols of the gods on each side of his ($_inasa) family on the side of his ($_inasa) body associated with them , moons and moon clan script on his ($_inasa) right , sun symbols and ancient art from the Sun Gods on his ($_inasa) left . It was unclear if the markings were painted on , tattooed on , or embedded somehow in his ($_inasa) skin , but they stood out starkly against his ($_inasa) pale chest , drawing Inasa ($_inasa) s eye and forcing him ($_inasa) to will himself ($_inasa) to look up . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) had managed to fully absorb the_prince_s_appearance_in_only_a_moment ($_inasa) , but it ($_inasa) was a quiet moment , a moment that Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) had spent watching Inasa ($_inasa) carefully . Inasa ($_inasa) opened his ($_inasa) mouth , knowing he ($_inasa) had to say something , anything . 
 Your Highness , Inasa ($_inasa) said slowly , not sure how to calm him ($_shouto) down , not even sure why news of a war would set him ($_shouto) off so much . 
 Y-Your Highness ! Inasa ($_inasa) said again , loud and fast this time . The desk was on fire . The wallpaper was in danger of catching , too . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was not hot-headed . In the month Inasa ($_inasa) had been with him ($_shouto) , he ($_shouto) d been eternally cool , emotions held in check , never betraying his ($_shouto) feelings one way or another , not in meetings with members of the court nor with Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 But now the room was in danger of catching on fire and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was ranting against his ($_shouto) father , things that would be treason if he ($_shouto) were anyone but the prince . Inasa ($_inasa) thought of his ($_shouto) orders , to protect the_prince ($_shouto) , from anyone , even himself ($_shouto) , and he ($_shouto) raised a single hand and blew out the fire spreading around Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) with a single blast . 
 Forgive me ($_shouto) , Your Highness ! Inasa ($_inasa) shouted , bowing so low his ($_shouto) head nearly hit the floor . My ($_shouto) instructions state to protect you by any means necessary ! Apologies for the rough treatment ! 
 Inasa ($_inasa) picked his ($_inasa) head up , surprised at the reaction . 
 My , Shouto ($_shouto) , I didn t realized His ($_shouto) Majesty knew what your ty - Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) began before Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) cut her ($_inasa) off with only a look . 
 The king doesn t dine with us , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) informed Inasa ($_inasa) as they ($_inasa) sat . Inasa ($_inasa) nodded . 
 It ($_inasa) is an honor , Your Grace , Inasa ($_inasa) said , hoping that he ($_inasa) had addressed her ($_inasa) properly . Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) smiled kindly before turning to the Prince . 
  Sir Inasa , this is my betrothed , Duchess Momo Yaoyorozu of Creati ($_creati) . We attended academy together and King Endeavor thought it to be a good match . Duchess Momo , this is my new bodyguard , Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said in introduction . Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) held her ($_duchess) hand out daintily and Inasa ($_inasa) gave it a perfunctory kiss . Creati ($_creati) was a planet in Inasa ($_inasa) s home planet s system , ore-rich land making them the manufacturing center of their system . Inasa ($_inasa) had done trade with them many times in his life . Only when they were another twenty steps down the hallway did Inasa ($_inasa) finally understand the double meaning . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) had been instructed to sit beside Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , so he took his place at the royal table , his own place setting clear ; between Shouto ($_shouto) s solid gold plate and a row of silver plates sat a pewter one , the same as the servants used . 
 A war ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) asked . Inasa ($_inasa) looked up as well . King_Endeavor ($_king) had said something to him ($_inasa) on his ($_inasa) first day , but when month passed without another mention of it ($_king) , he ($_inasa) figured it ($_king) had been an intimidation tactic . 
 The chambermaids came back after the walks and undressed the_prince ($_shouto) for the_day ($_the) while Inasa ($_inasa) took his daily bath in the servant bathroom in Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers . His baths were cold and short , returning promptly before the_prince ($_shouto) went to take his own bath . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s baths were long ; the steam from the water tumbled out from under the door . In moments of boredom , Inasa ($_inasa) allowed himself ($_inasa) to use his ($_inasa) ability to spin around the trails of steam into tiny tornados , sending them to dance around the room before they dissipated in the cool air . 
 Matching Sun God pendants for you and Her Grace , Duchess Momo , in celebration of your upcoming wedding , Your Highness . Made from the clay harvested on my lands . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) lifted the matching blood-red pendants with Sun God iconography etched onto their surfaces . Even from where he ($_shouto) was guarding the door , Inasa ($_inasa) could see the_prince ($_shouto) s mouth pinch together . 
 But then , as the two droned on about problems in the_Earl ($_the) s economy , he ($_inasa) said something that stuck out : Oh , and with that war coming , many of the citizens are trying to move to the areas of the planet that have more jobs in manufacturing , which isn t helping anything . 
 The_Earl ($_the) started talking , discussing his ($_the) land s local economy while Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) listened intently , nodding . This was usually when Inasa ($_inasa) started zoning out ; he ($_inasa) had no interest in economics or politics , nor Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s knowledge , and any agricultural talk surrounded the rocky , clay-filled earth , nothing like the soft soils and broad fields of Inasa ($_inasa) s home . 
 Agriculture ? he ($_shouto) said . Are you educated ? Inasa ($_inasa) wasn t sure what being a farmer had to do with going to school , but perhaps the_prince ($_shouto) had assumed he ($_shouto) was educated and was surprised that an educated person would be working on a farm . 
 It was a requirement for the position . My parents put away enough money for me and my siblings to go to school . Granted , nothing fancy like Your_Highness ($_highness) attended . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) just hummed in consideration , nodding to himself ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) cringed to himself ($_inasa) for the comment about the_prince ($_shouto) s schooling , but Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) didn t mention it . 
 I m from a family of farmers , Inasa ($_inasa) replied . Your_Highness ($_highness) , he ($_shouto) tacked on quickly . 
 They were walking back into the palace , Inasa ($_inasa) a few steps behind as always , but he ($_shouto) didn t miss the surprise pass across Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s face . 
 Does Her ($_duchess) Grace live in the palace , Your ($_duchess) Your_Highness ($_highness) ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked one day , as they ($_inasa) ended their ($_inasa) walk at Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chamber doors as always and Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) walked away , always in gorgeous dresses that fit her ($_duchess) perfectly and were striking to the eye . That day she ($_duchess) was in green , tiny flowers decorating the long sleeves that extended past her ($_duchess) hands and trailed behind her ($_duchess) on the floor . 
 Afternoons were spent in meetings , a blur of faces from the court that Inasa ($_inasa) would bow to and promptly forget . Evenings were spent at dinner and then in long walks around the palace with Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) . She ($_duchess) seemed to be the prince s main confidant , and Inasa ($_inasa) was glad that Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was going to wed a woman he ($_shouto) was , at the very least , friends with , even if he ($_shouto) wasn t happy with his ($_shouto) father s arrangements . 
 Perhaps Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s words jinxed it , but as it turned out , the meetings that day turned out to be the first time Inasa ($_inasa) hadn t been bored to tears . 
  Sir Inasa ($_inasa) ! Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) snapped , spinning around to face him ($_shouto) . It is in your job description to attend to me wherever I choose to go . You have no say in the matter . Now where I want to go is to the mailroom . Attempting to dissuade me is a disgrace to the crown . That shut Inasa ($_inasa) up . He knew the prince wouldn t have chosen to have a stroll all the way to the mailroom on his own , but it was true : if the_prince ($_shouto) wanted to do something , even if it was for Inasa ($_inasa) s benefit , then it wasn t his place to argue . He d been out of line , to speak to royalty that way . 
 C mon , watchdog , we re going . Inasa ($_inasa) followed behind him ($_shouto) as he ($_shouto) walked in the direction of the mailroom , and Inasa ($_inasa) felt himself ($_shouto) heat up from his ($_shouto) neck to his ($_shouto) cheeks . 
 Get up , watchdog , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) replied , but there was humor in his tone . Inasa ($_inasa) straightened out and they exited . 
 Come on, now. We ve got a million meetings today , we can t be late to our appointment for getting bored to tears . Inasa ($_inasa) chuckled quietly . For all his coldness , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) had a sort of chilly humor that entertained Inasa ($_inasa) , even in times when he didn t intend to be funny . 
 They finished the walk to the mailroom in silence and Inasa ($_inasa) put the crinkled envelope into the mail slot . Turning , he bowed deeply to Prince Shouto . 
 Ladies , don t let my father hear you speak like that , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) replied , no anger in his ($_shouto) tone . Ah , Inasa ($_inasa) realized . So he ($_shouto) was above the chambermaids , just not in the eyes of the_prince ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) s the new watchdog trained just for me , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) continued as he ($_shouto) climbed out of bed and walked gracefully to the chambermaids . 
 A gift for us as well ! another chimed in , causing another bout of titters . Inasa ($_inasa) found himself wondering how the hierarchy worked around here , if the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) could openly speak to the prince in such a manner . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) scoffed at the Your Highness . You may sit in this chair , watchdog , he ($_inasa) continued , lifting his ($_inasa) arm and indicating a seat by the lamp . Please refrain from speaking to me ($_inasa) for now . I m writing a letter . 
 Yes , Your Highness , he ($_inasa) managed eventually , bowing deeply . If all he ($_inasa) had to do was keep quiet and keep the prince and the king happy to ensure a better future for his ($_inasa) parents , then he ($_inasa) could do that , despite the burning curiosity in his ($_inasa) mind . 
 So you re the watchdog my ($_inasa) father has hand-selected to keep me ($_inasa) in line , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) cut in , voice cold and emotionless . Inasa ($_inasa) paused , not sure how to respond . He ($_inasa) figured that the_prince ($_shouto) would be different from the king , but he ($_inasa) wasn t expecting this . He ($_inasa) wasn t sure what he ($_inasa) had been expecting . 
 Prince_-_Inasa ($_inasa) Prince_-_Inasa_began_,_intending_to_introduce_himself ($_inasa) himself ($_inasa) . 
 My , Your Highness , the king has gotten you a gift , one of the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) said shamelessly , raking her eyes over Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 Chambermaids ($_chambermaids) , it turned out , were what disrupted their ($_chambermaids) long period of silence . The door opened to a small group of them ($_chambermaids) , chattering as they ($_chambermaids) entered . Inasa ($_inasa) stood and they ($_chambermaids) greeted him ($_inasa) , tittering amongst themselves ($_chambermaids) . 
 They were quiet a long time , Prince Shouto writing and Inasa ($_inasa) considering the fact that this was simultaneously the easiest and most disconcerting way to earn money he ($_inasa) d experienced in his ($_inasa) life . The quiet was uneasy , and Inasa ($_inasa) knew that the peace could be disrupted at any moment , by King_Endeavor ($_king) or criminals or - 
 Inasa ($_inasa) nodded , striding over to the wine red chair and settling into its ($_inasa) lush cushions . It ($_inasa) was luxury he ($_inasa) d never seen in his ($_inasa) lifetime . He ($_inasa) got comfortable , sitting quietly , watching the door , and listening to the scratch of Prince Shouto s pen against his ($_inasa) paper . 
  After dinner , Duchess Momo and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) strolled through the courtyards , Inasa ($_inasa) walking a distance behind them , far enough that he ($_shouto) couldn t overhear their conversation . There was maybe a foot of space between the two of them , but their body language betrayed a familiarity with one another . Inasa ($_inasa) wondered about their ($_inasa) relationship . As they ($_inasa) made their ($_inasa) way back inside and toward Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers , Inasa ($_inasa) couldn t help but feel like he ($_shouto) was intruding . What if the_prince ($_shouto) wanted to take the duchess into his ($_shouto) bed ? It was his ($_shouto) duty to always be in the_prince_s_presence ($_shouto) , but he ($_shouto) wasn t sure if he ($_shouto) d be able to stand guard and listen to them . Inasa ($_inasa) watched them approach the doors to Prince Shouto s chambers and his ($_shouto) face heated . The two spoke for another moment before Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) pulled Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) into a tight hug and walked away . Inasa ($_inasa) blinked . A hug was somewhat untraditional for a betrothed pair . He ($_shouto) had expected a pair of bows , or perhaps a curtsy and a kiss of the hand . 
 He ($_shouto) followed Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) back into his ($_shouto) chambers and sat back in the chair as Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) began loosening the ties of his ($_shouto) outfit . He ($_shouto) didn t undress , only untucked and popped a few buttons before lying back in his ($_shouto) bed and sighing . He ($_shouto) turned to Inasa after a moment , considering him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) looked back at him ($_shouto) , not totally sure if it ($_inasa) was appropriate for him ($_shouto) to make eye contact but doing so nonetheless , losing himself ($_shouto) in one grey and one blue eye . 
  Just so you know , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , gesturing with a hand to the door . Momo ($_momo) isn t permitted to enter my bed chambers until , ah , until our wedding night . So you don t have to , well , you don t have to worry about any of that . He ($_shouto) stumbled through his ($_shouto) words , breaking his ($_shouto) eye contact . Inasa ($_inasa) just nodded , internally sighing in relief . If you don t mind my asking , Inasa ($_inasa) said . When is the happy occasion ? The rumors about the royal family hadn t ever included an engagement , but the eventual wedding would no doubt be the talk of the galaxy . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) crinkled his ($_shouto) nose . 
 Ah , Inasa ($_inasa) said . A marriage of convenience , just like King_Endeavor ($_king) s own . His friend from school that the king had deemed to be the most advantageous ally , what with the boundless raw materials of Creati ($_creati) , the deal likely struck before they graduated . He wondered if Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) loved her . 
  What do you think of the king ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) asked suddenly . Inasa ($_inasa) was taken aback . He ($_inasa) wasn t sure what Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s angle could possibly be . He ($_inasa) must ve known that in Inasa ($_inasa) s position , he ($_inasa) wouldn t dare to say anything negative . I m grateful to His ($_inasa) Majesty for giving me this job , Inasa ($_inasa) said carefully , choosing his ($_inasa) words one at a time . He ($_inasa) opened his ($_inasa) mouth to say something about his ($_inasa) parents , but closed it before he ($_inasa) did . 
  Inasa ($_inasa) didn t realize that it ($_inasa) had been a month until one of the chambermaids handed him ($_inasa) an envelope one evening . He ($_inasa) peered into it and found his ($_inasa) compensation for the month , worth what he ($_inasa) d make in half a year selling his ($_inasa) crops . He ($_inasa) gasped and tears sprung to his ($_inasa) eyes . He ($_inasa) blinked them back , but his ($_inasa) heart squeezed with happiness . That night he ($_inasa) fell asleep in his ($_inasa) chair clutching the envelope in his ($_inasa) hands . Days melted into weeks with the routine always the same . Inasa ($_inasa) was good at routine ; it reminded him ($_inasa) of back home on the farm , doing the same work over and over . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) hadn t warmed up to him ($_shouto) , per se , but their relationship became less cold . Inasa ($_inasa) was a part of his ($_inasa) life now , always trailing on his ($_inasa) heels and holding doors open for him ($_inasa) and sleeping in a chair by the doors to his ($_inasa) chambers . The_prince ($_shouto) was a part of Inasa ($_inasa) s life too , he ($_inasa) realized , an aspect of every one of his ($_inasa) waking thoughts , his ($_inasa) constant concern . 
  Huh ($_huh) ? No ? Inasa ($_inasa) s face fell , at which Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , why ? Do you need me to go to the mailroom for some rea-oh . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) paused as he ($_shouto) realized why Inasa ($_inasa) has asked the question . You can t go alone , can you , watchdog ? Inasa ($_inasa) shook his ($_inasa) head . He ($_inasa) wasn t allowed to leave the_prince ($_shouto) s side except to bathe ; the only chance he ($_inasa) d have to mail his ($_inasa) compensation was when Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) decided to go to the mailroom . Your Highness ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked at breakfast the following morning . Are you writing any letters this morning ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) looked up from his ($_shouto) porridge questioningly . 
 It s fine , he ($_inasa) said quickly . I can mail it whenever you need to mail something next , there s no rush ! 
 What is it , what you want to mail ? Inasa ($_inasa) blinked down to the table . The envelope with the money and a letter he ($_inasa) d written burned in his ($_inasa) pocket . 
 Your mother is right . His ($_god) father nodded . Farming is a quiet life , but it s respectable and fulfilling . You have a talent for your work , Inasa ($_inasa) , and we need your help . Don t leave . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) , why throw your life away for that_tyrant ($_god) ?! his ($_god) mother exclaimed , rushing to him ($_god) and grabbing his ($_god) arm . 
  They were right , really . Inasa ($_inasa) lived on a planet with intense storms , always swirling in the sky . They received plenty of rain , but the storms made it difficult to do much else but tend the land , so they were an agricultural society , and the genetic ability of many of their people to control the wind helped push back the storms when they were at their worst and protect the crops . Inasa ($_inasa) had taken over the family farm from the tending of his ($_inasa) mother after he ($_inasa) returned from school . He ($_inasa) cared for his ($_inasa) parents , who were advancing in age , and his ($_inasa) younger siblings . Inasa ($_inasa) left his ($_inasa) home and caught the next starship toward Amaterasu ($_amaterasu) , King_Endeavor ($_king) s planet . Rumors swirled of him ($_inasa) building a royal guard , his ($_inasa) need for strong young men to protect what belonged to him ($_inasa) . 
  Hayate is old enough and strong enough to handle the farms now , he ($_inasa) said , referring to his ($_inasa) younger brother who had recently returned home from school . And our family is in desperate need of money . If I work for King_Endeavor ($_king) I ll be able to send back enough for you to pay for your medicine and to be able to keep our lights on . Their planet was running technologically behind many in their system and galaxy due to the intensity of the storms , which caused struggles for their elders . Inasa ($_inasa) hoped to one day move his parents across the solar system to a safer planet where they could comfortably live the rest of their lives . With the little money he made selling his crops , that would never be a possibility . What belonged to him ($_inasa) turned out to be his ($_inasa) son . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) had been on a bit of a rebellious streak in the past couple years since his ($_shouto) return from boarding school . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) endured the grueling training process and heavy interviewing and vetting , displaying his ($_inasa) wind abilities and his ($_inasa) physical prowess , knowing he ($_inasa) was strong enough to be included in the royal guard . After a few weeks , he ($_inasa) was called to the king s chambers and told that he ($_inasa) was chosen as a bodyguard for King_Endeavor ($_king) . Inasa ($_inasa) bowed deeply . For the pay , he ($_inasa) d do anything to protect what King_Endeavor ($_king) asked him ($_inasa) to . 
 The other students poisoned his ($_shouto) mind , King_Endeavor ($_king) said gruffly as he ($_shouto) led Inasa to the prince s chambers . He ($_shouto) thinks he ($_shouto) can just disappear and run off with his ($_shouto) friends and see the galaxy . A cape of flames surrounded the King . It was difficult to stand too close to him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) couldn t help but think that he ($_shouto) could understand why a young prince just introduced to the outside world might want to leave King_Endeavor ($_king) and return to it ($_king) with the friends he ($_shouto) d made . 
 Nothing at all , watchdog . It ($_inasa) s just that you won t be able to open that door , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said . You re free to try , though . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) dropped his hand . No thank you , Your Highness . I have no interest in futile endeavors . A wry smile ghosted along the edge of Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s mouth , only for a moment , possibly an illusion in the low light . 
 Absolutely not , Your Highness , Inasa ($_inasa) said , walking towards the door and making as if to pull it ($_inasa) open . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) made a sound behind him ($_shouto) , something that sounded like a stifled chuckle . Inasa ($_inasa) paused , his ($_inasa) hand hovering over the handle of the door . 
 Something wrong , Your Highness ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked . 
 There were more giggles , and more whispers to Prince Shouto . Inasa ($_inasa) stayed put , standing by the chair as the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) slipped off his robe . He wasn t watching , but it ($_inasa) was impossible not to notice how the markings continued onto his back , his entire upper half decorated with impossibly detailed patterns , ancient prayers , and iconography . 
 The_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) sang quietly as they ($_chambermaids) dressed Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , covering him with layers , tying and wrapping and buttoning him into his dinner wear . He stood passively as they ($_chambermaids) dressed him , the task mundane to him . Inasa ($_inasa) realized this ($_inasa) must ve been a normal task for him , the chambermaids possibly the same chambermaids that had dressed him since birth . 
 Does the watchdog have a name ? one of the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) asked , turning from the_prince_to_look_at_Inasa ($_shouto) Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 Y-you may call me Inasa ($_inasa) ! Inasa ($_inasa) said , bowing to the chambermaid . 
 These legends , stories Inasa ($_inasa) had heard over and over growing up , were why his ($_god) parents were so incredulous when he ($_god) walked in from the fields one afternoon , hung up his ($_god) hat , and announced he ($_god) was leaving home to work for King_Endeavor ($_king) . 
  He ($_shouto) clearly didn t want to be watched like a child , and Inasa ($_inasa) could understand that . He ($_shouto) called Inasa ($_inasa) his ($_shouto) watchdog , and only spoke to Inasa when necessary . He ($_shouto) woke up early , but not as early as Inasa ($_inasa) , and went running every morning . Inasa ($_inasa) trotted behind him ($_shouto) , impressed with the_prince ($_shouto) s stamina but not terribly troubled to keep up . A lifetime of arduous farmwork bolstered his ($_shouto) lung capacity and leg strength , and it ($_inasa) was clear that King_Endeavor ($_king) had wanted a strong man as a bodyguard not only to protect the_prince ($_shouto) but also to keep him ($_shouto) from setting too quick a pace and running away under his ($_shouto) nose . He ($_shouto) could hear the bath water running . The sound of the rushing water was soothing , and Inasa ($_inasa) imagined that he ($_shouto) was the one in the hot water , sloughing off the aches of the_day ($_the) . He ($_shouto) thought of his ($_shouto) parents and young siblings , and steeled himself ($_shouto) . 
 Don ($_don) t worry , he ($_don) barred all the windows in my chambers years ago . I was rebellious even before I went to school . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) crossed the room to the entrance to the bathroom , shutting the door behind him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) looked around and found that the windows were indeed barred off . 
 N-no , Your_Highness ($_highness) , Inasa ($_inasa) stammered , looking down at his ($_inasa) own feet . As , uh , as long as you promise not to jump out the window . I d prefer not to lose my job on the first day . 
  I ve been running faster every_day ($_every) . I m not even really trying to get away , I m just impressed , I suppose . Inasa ($_inasa) grinned , in spite of himself ($_shouto) . A lifetime of farmwork could impress a prince with a lifetime of combat training . 

($_the)	King_Endeavor ($_king) took Princess Rei to a new planet , cooler than the_Sun_Gods_' ($_the) planet and warmer than the moon clan planet , named Amaterasu , where many Sun God worshippers lived , and wed her ($_natsuo) , ruling over the citizens with her ($_natsuo) as his reluctant queen . She ($_natsuo) bore him four children and named them after the moons of her ($_natsuo) home planet ; Touya , Fuyumi , Natsuo ($_natsuo) , and Shouto . King_Endeavor ($_king) exiled them in turn to the moon clan s planet , the first three children being unsatisfactory to him ($_king) . 
 Of c-course , Your Highness ! The_Earl ($_the) bowed deeply and sprinted out of the room . 
 Ah , well , yes , Your Highness . Surely you ve heard the news about King Endeavor wanting to annex a planet in System_8 ($_system) ? The_Earl ($_the) looked nervous . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) looked furious . 
 The chambermaids came back after the walks and undressed the_prince ($_shouto) for the_day ($_the) while Inasa ($_inasa) took his daily bath in the servant bathroom in Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers . His baths were cold and short , returning promptly before the_prince ($_shouto) went to take his own bath . 
 But then , as the two droned on about problems in the_Earl ($_the) s economy , he ($_inasa) said something that stuck out : Oh , and with that war coming , many of the citizens are trying to move to the areas of the planet that have more jobs in manufacturing , which isn t helping anything . 
 The_Earl ($_the) started talking , discussing his ($_the) land s local economy while Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) listened intently , nodding . This was usually when Inasa ($_inasa) started zoning out ; he ($_inasa) had no interest in economics or politics , nor Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s knowledge , and any agricultural talk surrounded the rocky , clay-filled earth , nothing like the soft soils and broad fields of Inasa ($_inasa) s home . 
 It was no way to live , at either end of the temperature spectrum . King_Endeavor ($_king) left the planet of the_Sun_Gods ($_the) and bargained with the moon clan , taking the eldest royal daughter to be his bride in exchange for a single , eternally flickering flame , kept in the town center , that could provide heat in the coldest months , with their distant star barely keeping them alive . 
  His ($_shouto) father was King Endeavor of the_Sun_Gods ($_the) . They harnessed the power of the massive sun their planet orbited , controlling their own flames . It was said that each of the_Sun_Gods ($_the) had enormous amounts of power to withstand the toll of the intense and overbearing constant heat , but after all , they were gods . Gods made mortal , however . The folklore said that the_earthbound_Sun_Gods ($_the) were cast out of their ($_the) heaven by their ($_the) leader for treason , bound into mortal bodies and forced to experience the heat the way a human would . The_Earl ($_the) nodded , trembling . Y-yes , Your Highness . It s no secret that King_Endeavor ($_king) wants to control the t-textile industry , even if he ($_shouto) does start a w-war . Beads of sweat rolled down the_Earl ($_the) s face . The room was suddenly boiling hot , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s left side steaming . 
 He ($_shouto) could hear the bath water running . The sound of the rushing water was soothing , and Inasa ($_inasa) imagined that he ($_shouto) was the one in the hot water , sloughing off the aches of the_day ($_the) . He ($_shouto) thought of his ($_shouto) parents and young siblings , and steeled himself ($_shouto) . 
 

($_highness)	It was a requirement for the position . My parents put away enough money for me and my siblings to go to school . Granted , nothing fancy like Your_Highness ($_highness) attended . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) just hummed in consideration , nodding to himself ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) cringed to himself ($_inasa) for the comment about the_prince ($_shouto) s schooling , but Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) didn t mention it . 
 I m from a family of farmers , Inasa ($_inasa) replied . Your_Highness ($_highness) , he ($_shouto) tacked on quickly . 
 Does Her ($_duchess) Grace live in the palace , Your ($_duchess) Your_Highness ($_highness) ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked one day , as they ($_inasa) ended their ($_inasa) walk at Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chamber doors as always and Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) walked away , always in gorgeous dresses that fit her ($_duchess) perfectly and were striking to the eye . That day she ($_duchess) was in green , tiny flowers decorating the long sleeves that extended past her ($_duchess) hands and trailed behind her ($_duchess) on the floor . 
 N-no , Your_Highness ($_highness) , Inasa ($_inasa) stammered , looking down at his ($_inasa) own feet . As , uh , as long as you promise not to jump out the window . I d prefer not to lose my job on the first day . 
 

($_shouto)	What??? was that, anyway? the_prince ($_shouto) said as they walked back to his ($_shouto) chambers , pantomiming Inasa ($_inasa) s hands , referencing the wind power . 
 If the king hears about this , he ($_shouto) told them , tell him ($_shouto) that his ($_shouto) heir heard about the fight he ($_shouto) s picking . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) apologized profusely to a few very concerned and afraid soldiers who had been waiting outside the room and overheard it all . He ($_shouto) told them to leave the damage as it was . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) looked at him ($_shouto) carefully but didn t say anything else . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) hummed in consideration . I envy you . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) entered the chambers , not knowing what to expect . As his ($_inasa) eyes adjusted to the low light of the chambers , he ($_inasa) saw Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , sitting on his ($_inasa) bed in the center of the room , and Inasa ($_inasa) had to hold his ($_inasa) breath to prevent himself ($_inasa) from gasping because - 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was gorgeous . 
 There were no photos of the_prince ($_shouto) , no recorded images available to the public -LRB- not that Inasa ($_inasa) had any means of accessing the Skynet connective systems that people in the galaxy used to share information , his ($_inasa) family too poor to own any computing technology -RRB- . All information about him ($_inasa) spread by word-of-mouth , quickened by the notoriety of the family . 
 King_Endeavor ($_king) considered him ($_shouto) for a moment as they ($_king) approached a set of massive ebony doors at the end of a long passageway . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers , Inasa ($_inasa) thought , marveling at the dark wood and the intricate designs carved into its ($_king) surface . 
 I ($_shouto) expect you to spend all of your time by my ($_shouto) son s side . You will protect him from any intruders , as well as from himself . He should not leave Amaterasu ($_amaterasu) . Even better if he does not leave the palace . 
  Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , King_Endeavor ($_king) said after a long pause . I ($_shouto) am expecting a war to begin in the near future .  You must be completely prepared to devote your life to protecting my ($_shouto) son .  He is sure to be targeted by enemies . He is the only heir I ($_shouto) have . Inasa ($_inasa) nodded , stories of the exiled three children caught in his throat .  I ($_shouto) ll leave you , then .  Do not let Shouto ($_shouto) out of your sight . You will receive your compensation on the first of every month . King_Endeavor ($_king) pushed open the left ebony door with a fiery palm . Inasa ($_inasa) had managed to fully absorb the_prince_s_appearance_in_only_a_moment ($_inasa) , but it ($_inasa) was a quiet moment , a moment that Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) had spent watching Inasa ($_inasa) carefully . Inasa ($_inasa) opened his ($_inasa) mouth , knowing he ($_inasa) had to say something , anything . 
 Your Highness , Inasa ($_inasa) said slowly , not sure how to calm him ($_shouto) down , not even sure why news of a war would set him ($_shouto) off so much . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) stood and , with a shout , brought a flaming fist down onto the desk , snapping the wood and leaving the surface scorched . 
 That bastard ! he ($_shouto) yelled , fire spreading across the left side of his ($_shouto) body . That power-hungry bastard ! 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was not hot-headed . In the month Inasa ($_inasa) had been with him ($_shouto) , he ($_shouto) d been eternally cool , emotions held in check , never betraying his ($_shouto) feelings one way or another , not in meetings with members of the court nor with Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 But now the room was in danger of catching on fire and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was ranting against his ($_shouto) father , things that would be treason if he ($_shouto) were anyone but the prince . Inasa ($_inasa) thought of his ($_shouto) orders , to protect the_prince ($_shouto) , from anyone , even himself ($_shouto) , and he ($_shouto) raised a single hand and blew out the fire spreading around Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) with a single blast . 
 The wind knocked Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) off balance ; he ($_shouto) stumbled backward but did not fall . He ($_shouto) turned to Inasa , incredulous . 
 Forgive me ($_shouto) , Your Highness ! Inasa ($_inasa) shouted , bowing so low his ($_shouto) head nearly hit the floor . My ($_shouto) instructions state to protect you by any means necessary ! Apologies for the rough treatment ! 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) huffed . Quit bowing to me ($_shouto) so much , watchdog . It just reminds me ($_shouto) that you were hired by the king . Then , quieter : Thank you . 
 I m very sorry , sir ($_sir) , the_prince ($_shouto) said , keeping his ($_shouto) voice calm and holding the side of the table . I m going to have to cut our meeting short today . Thank you for the wedding gift . Now please , if you d leave me . 
 They ate mostly in silence , the quiet disrupted only by the sound of silverware or another member of the table asking the prince questions about diplomacy or trade . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) conjured answers to questions on complicated matters easily . He ($_shouto) was clearly the most intelligent person in the room , years of training and schooling on show . 
 My , Shouto ($_shouto) , I didn t realized His ($_shouto) Majesty knew what your ty - Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) began before Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) cut her ($_inasa) off with only a look . 
 The other members of the court trickled in , taking specific seats that were likely designated by the hierarchy . A tall woman with long black hair woven into a braided updo and an embroidered red dress approached the setting beside Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) . She bowed , more a shallow head nod than anything , then slipped into the seat beside him . He also acknowledged her with the same half-nod bow . 
 The king doesn t dine with us , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) informed Inasa ($_inasa) as they ($_inasa) sat . Inasa ($_inasa) nodded . 
  Sir Inasa , this is my betrothed , Duchess Momo Yaoyorozu of Creati ($_creati) . We attended academy together and King Endeavor thought it to be a good match . Duchess Momo , this is my new bodyguard , Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said in introduction . Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) held her ($_duchess) hand out daintily and Inasa ($_inasa) gave it a perfunctory kiss . Creati ($_creati) was a planet in Inasa ($_inasa) s home planet s system , ore-rich land making them the manufacturing center of their system . Inasa ($_inasa) had done trade with them many times in his life . Inasa ($_inasa) had been instructed to sit beside Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , so he took his place at the royal table , his own place setting clear ; between Shouto ($_shouto) s solid gold plate and a row of silver plates sat a pewter one , the same as the servants used . 
 Ah , well , yes , Your Highness . Surely you ve heard the news about King Endeavor wanting to annex a planet in System_8 ($_system) ? The_Earl ($_the) looked nervous . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) looked furious . 
 A war ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) asked . Inasa ($_inasa) looked up as well . King_Endeavor ($_king) had said something to him ($_inasa) on his ($_inasa) first day , but when month passed without another mention of it ($_king) , he ($_inasa) figured it ($_king) had been an intimidation tactic . 
 The chambermaids came back after the walks and undressed the_prince ($_shouto) for the_day ($_the) while Inasa ($_inasa) took his daily bath in the servant bathroom in Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers . His baths were cold and short , returning promptly before the_prince ($_shouto) went to take his own bath . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s baths were long ; the steam from the water tumbled out from under the door . In moments of boredom , Inasa ($_inasa) allowed himself ($_inasa) to use his ($_inasa) ability to spin around the trails of steam into tiny tornados , sending them to dance around the room before they dissipated in the cool air . 
 Matching Sun God pendants for you and Her Grace , Duchess Momo , in celebration of your upcoming wedding , Your Highness . Made from the clay harvested on my lands . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) lifted the matching blood-red pendants with Sun God iconography etched onto their surfaces . Even from where he ($_shouto) was guarding the door , Inasa ($_inasa) could see the_prince ($_shouto) s mouth pinch together . 
 Ah , thank you , sir ($_sir) . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) peered into the basket . 
 The_Earl ($_the) started talking , discussing his ($_the) land s local economy while Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) listened intently , nodding . This was usually when Inasa ($_inasa) started zoning out ; he ($_inasa) had no interest in economics or politics , nor Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s knowledge , and any agricultural talk surrounded the rocky , clay-filled earth , nothing like the soft soils and broad fields of Inasa ($_inasa) s home . 
 Agriculture ? he ($_shouto) said . Are you educated ? Inasa ($_inasa) wasn t sure what being a farmer had to do with going to school , but perhaps the_prince ($_shouto) had assumed he ($_shouto) was educated and was surprised that an educated person would be working on a farm . 
 It was a requirement for the position . My parents put away enough money for me and my siblings to go to school . Granted , nothing fancy like Your_Highness ($_highness) attended . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) just hummed in consideration , nodding to himself ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) cringed to himself ($_inasa) for the comment about the_prince ($_shouto) s schooling , but Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) didn t mention it . 
 I m from a family of farmers , Inasa ($_inasa) replied . Your_Highness ($_highness) , he ($_shouto) tacked on quickly . 
 They were walking back into the palace , Inasa ($_inasa) a few steps behind as always , but he ($_shouto) didn t miss the surprise pass across Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s face . 
 Does Her ($_duchess) Grace live in the palace , Your ($_duchess) Your_Highness ($_highness) ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked one day , as they ($_inasa) ended their ($_inasa) walk at Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chamber doors as always and Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) walked away , always in gorgeous dresses that fit her ($_duchess) perfectly and were striking to the eye . That day she ($_duchess) was in green , tiny flowers decorating the long sleeves that extended past her ($_duchess) hands and trailed behind her ($_duchess) on the floor . 
 After their runs , they ate a small breakfast , and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) spent the rest of his ($_shouto) morning writing . He ($_shouto) wrote dozens of letters every_day ($_every) , surely to friends and family and concerned citizens . The chambermaids would enter at some point in the morning to dress Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) and fix his ($_shouto) hair , sometimes leaving it down and sweeping it back and sometimes piling it on top of his ($_shouto) head with the tiniest of braids woven in the red and white . Rarer were ponytails or single braids down his ($_shouto) back , and rarer still was the half-up bun , a style only for his ($_shouto) most casual of days , when Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) would lounge in his ($_shouto) robe half the day and peruse Skynet on his ($_shouto) machine in the computing room . 
 Afternoons were spent in meetings , a blur of faces from the court that Inasa ($_inasa) would bow to and promptly forget . Evenings were spent at dinner and then in long walks around the palace with Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) . She ($_duchess) seemed to be the prince s main confidant , and Inasa ($_inasa) was glad that Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was going to wed a woman he ($_shouto) was , at the very least , friends with , even if he ($_shouto) wasn t happy with his ($_shouto) father s arrangements . 
 It was said , at the very least . A million legends surrounded the angry red mark on Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s face . He ($_god) was shielded from the world until he ($_god) was fifteen and sent to academy , at which point his ($_god) appearance was revealed to the world and rumors of the scar spread through the galaxy . Even to his ($_god) classmates was Prince Shouto tight-lipped about his ($_god) life . Stories , myths , and gossip about his ($_god) family spilled forth from both the school and the loose-lipped people of the moon clan planet . 
 Perhaps Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s words jinxed it , but as it turned out , the meetings that day turned out to be the first time Inasa ($_inasa) hadn t been bored to tears . 
  Sir Inasa ($_inasa) ! Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) snapped , spinning around to face him ($_shouto) . It is in your job description to attend to me wherever I choose to go . You have no say in the matter . Now where I want to go is to the mailroom . Attempting to dissuade me is a disgrace to the crown . That shut Inasa ($_inasa) up . He knew the prince wouldn t have chosen to have a stroll all the way to the mailroom on his own , but it was true : if the_prince ($_shouto) wanted to do something , even if it was for Inasa ($_inasa) s benefit , then it wasn t his place to argue . He d been out of line , to speak to royalty that way . 
 C mon , watchdog , we re going . Inasa ($_inasa) followed behind him ($_shouto) as he ($_shouto) walked in the direction of the mailroom , and Inasa ($_inasa) felt himself ($_shouto) heat up from his ($_shouto) neck to his ($_shouto) cheeks . 
 Get up , watchdog , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) replied , but there was humor in his tone . Inasa ($_inasa) straightened out and they exited . 
 Come on, now. We ve got a million meetings today , we can t be late to our appointment for getting bored to tears . Inasa ($_inasa) chuckled quietly . For all his coldness , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) had a sort of chilly humor that entertained Inasa ($_inasa) , even in times when he didn t intend to be funny . 
 Ladies , don t let my father hear you speak like that , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) replied , no anger in his ($_shouto) tone . Ah , Inasa ($_inasa) realized . So he ($_shouto) was above the chambermaids , just not in the eyes of the_prince ($_shouto) . He ($_shouto) s the new watchdog trained just for me , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) continued as he ($_shouto) climbed out of bed and walked gracefully to the chambermaids . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) scoffed at the Your Highness . You may sit in this chair , watchdog , he ($_inasa) continued , lifting his ($_inasa) arm and indicating a seat by the lamp . Please refrain from speaking to me ($_inasa) for now . I m writing a letter . 
 So you re the watchdog my ($_inasa) father has hand-selected to keep me ($_inasa) in line , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) cut in , voice cold and emotionless . Inasa ($_inasa) paused , not sure how to respond . He ($_inasa) figured that the_prince ($_shouto) would be different from the king , but he ($_inasa) wasn t expecting this . He ($_inasa) wasn t sure what he ($_inasa) had been expecting . 
  After dinner , Duchess Momo and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) strolled through the courtyards , Inasa ($_inasa) walking a distance behind them , far enough that he ($_shouto) couldn t overhear their conversation . There was maybe a foot of space between the two of them , but their body language betrayed a familiarity with one another . Inasa ($_inasa) wondered about their ($_inasa) relationship . As they ($_inasa) made their ($_inasa) way back inside and toward Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers , Inasa ($_inasa) couldn t help but feel like he ($_shouto) was intruding . What if the_prince ($_shouto) wanted to take the duchess into his ($_shouto) bed ? It was his ($_shouto) duty to always be in the_prince_s_presence ($_shouto) , but he ($_shouto) wasn t sure if he ($_shouto) d be able to stand guard and listen to them . Inasa ($_inasa) watched them approach the doors to Prince Shouto s chambers and his ($_shouto) face heated . The two spoke for another moment before Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) pulled Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) into a tight hug and walked away . Inasa ($_inasa) blinked . A hug was somewhat untraditional for a betrothed pair . He ($_shouto) had expected a pair of bows , or perhaps a curtsy and a kiss of the hand . 
 He ($_shouto) followed Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) back into his ($_shouto) chambers and sat back in the chair as Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) began loosening the ties of his ($_shouto) outfit . He ($_shouto) didn t undress , only untucked and popped a few buttons before lying back in his ($_shouto) bed and sighing . He ($_shouto) turned to Inasa after a moment , considering him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) looked back at him ($_shouto) , not totally sure if it ($_inasa) was appropriate for him ($_shouto) to make eye contact but doing so nonetheless , losing himself ($_shouto) in one grey and one blue eye . 
  Just so you know , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , gesturing with a hand to the door . Momo ($_momo) isn t permitted to enter my bed chambers until , ah , until our wedding night . So you don t have to , well , you don t have to worry about any of that . He ($_shouto) stumbled through his ($_shouto) words , breaking his ($_shouto) eye contact . Inasa ($_inasa) just nodded , internally sighing in relief . If you don t mind my asking , Inasa ($_inasa) said . When is the happy occasion ? The rumors about the royal family hadn t ever included an engagement , but the eventual wedding would no doubt be the talk of the galaxy . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) crinkled his ($_shouto) nose . 
 Ah , Inasa ($_inasa) said . A marriage of convenience , just like King_Endeavor ($_king) s own . His friend from school that the king had deemed to be the most advantageous ally , what with the boundless raw materials of Creati ($_creati) , the deal likely struck before they graduated . He wondered if Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) loved her . 
  What do you think of the king ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) asked suddenly . Inasa ($_inasa) was taken aback . He ($_inasa) wasn t sure what Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s angle could possibly be . He ($_inasa) must ve known that in Inasa ($_inasa) s position , he ($_inasa) wouldn t dare to say anything negative . I see , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , and perhaps that was all he ($_shouto) needed to understand . 
  His ($_shouto) father was King Endeavor of the_Sun_Gods ($_the) . They harnessed the power of the massive sun their planet orbited , controlling their own flames . It was said that each of the_Sun_Gods ($_the) had enormous amounts of power to withstand the toll of the intense and overbearing constant heat , but after all , they were gods . Gods made mortal , however . The folklore said that the_earthbound_Sun_Gods ($_the) were cast out of their ($_the) heaven by their ($_the) leader for treason , bound into mortal bodies and forced to experience the heat the way a human would . He ($_shouto) allowed Rei ($_rei) to return home once a year to visit her family . Rei ($_rei) brought Shouto ($_shouto) with her ($_shouto) one year after a few hours of begging . Shouto ($_shouto) clinged to her ($_shouto) leg and barely spoke to his estranged siblings , hiding behind Rei ($_rei) as she ($_shouto) spoke in low tones to her ($_shouto) mother over the flame in the town square . As she ($_shouto) boiled a cup of water for tea , it was said that she ($_shouto) , disgusted at the sight of her ($_shouto) own son s Sun God ($_god) half , tipped the boiling water into his ($_god) face . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) stared at him ($_shouto) for a second before pushing away his ($_shouto) bowl and standing . 
 Days melted into weeks with the routine always the same . Inasa ($_inasa) was good at routine ; it reminded him ($_inasa) of back home on the farm , doing the same work over and over . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) hadn t warmed up to him ($_shouto) , per se , but their relationship became less cold . Inasa ($_inasa) was a part of his ($_inasa) life now , always trailing on his ($_inasa) heels and holding doors open for him ($_inasa) and sleeping in a chair by the doors to his ($_inasa) chambers . The_prince ($_shouto) was a part of Inasa ($_inasa) s life too , he ($_inasa) realized , an aspect of every one of his ($_inasa) waking thoughts , his ($_inasa) constant concern . 
  Huh ($_huh) ? No ? Inasa ($_inasa) s face fell , at which Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said , why ? Do you need me to go to the mailroom for some rea-oh . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) paused as he ($_shouto) realized why Inasa ($_inasa) has asked the question . You can t go alone , can you , watchdog ? Inasa ($_inasa) shook his ($_inasa) head . He ($_inasa) wasn t allowed to leave the_prince ($_shouto) s side except to bathe ; the only chance he ($_inasa) d have to mail his ($_inasa) compensation was when Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) decided to go to the mailroom . Your Highness ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked at breakfast the following morning . Are you writing any letters this morning ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) looked up from his ($_shouto) porridge questioningly . 
 What belonged to him ($_inasa) turned out to be his ($_inasa) son . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) had been on a bit of a rebellious streak in the past couple years since his ($_shouto) return from boarding school . 
 Instead he ($_shouto) simply responded , Yes , Your_Majesty ($_your) , and bowed . 
 The other students poisoned his ($_shouto) mind , King_Endeavor ($_king) said gruffly as he ($_shouto) led Inasa to the prince s chambers . He ($_shouto) thinks he ($_shouto) can just disappear and run off with his ($_shouto) friends and see the galaxy . A cape of flames surrounded the King . It was difficult to stand too close to him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) couldn t help but think that he ($_shouto) could understand why a young prince just introduced to the outside world might want to leave King_Endeavor ($_king) and return to it ($_king) with the friends he ($_shouto) d made . 
 The_Earl ($_the) nodded , trembling . Y-yes , Your Highness . It s no secret that King_Endeavor ($_king) wants to control the t-textile industry , even if he ($_shouto) does start a w-war . Beads of sweat rolled down the_Earl ($_the) s face . The room was suddenly boiling hot , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s left side steaming . 
 System 8 ? He ($_shouto) asked , his ($_shouto) voice level but angry . System_8 ($_system) , as in King All Might s system ? 
 Nothing at all , watchdog . It ($_inasa) s just that you won t be able to open that door , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said . You re free to try , though . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) dropped his hand . No thank you , Your Highness . I have no interest in futile endeavors . A wry smile ghosted along the edge of Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s mouth , only for a moment , possibly an illusion in the low light . 
 Absolutely not , Your Highness , Inasa ($_inasa) said , walking towards the door and making as if to pull it ($_inasa) open . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) made a sound behind him ($_shouto) , something that sounded like a stifled chuckle . Inasa ($_inasa) paused , his ($_inasa) hand hovering over the handle of the door . 
 The_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) sang quietly as they ($_chambermaids) dressed Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) , covering him with layers , tying and wrapping and buttoning him into his dinner wear . He stood passively as they ($_chambermaids) dressed him , the task mundane to him . Inasa ($_inasa) realized this ($_inasa) must ve been a normal task for him , the chambermaids possibly the same chambermaids that had dressed him since birth . 
 Does the watchdog have a name ? one of the_chambermaids ($_chambermaids) asked , turning from the_prince_to_look_at_Inasa ($_shouto) Inasa ($_inasa) . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was the child of the moon and the sun . His ($_shouto) mother was the princess of the moon clan , who hailed from a planet with four moons , a planet blanketed in nearly eternal night , so far from its own sun that the surface was covered in ice and the only light was what could be reflected by the moons . The royalty of this planet had the ability to manipulate ice at will ; it was said that they were descended from the moon deities who created the four satellites of the planet . They praised the moons , for the light and guidance they gave to the people . They lived by the ice , in carved-out cubic buildings , exporting ice as their main commerce to local systems that lacked ice or water . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was his ($_shouto) masterpiece . He ($_shouto) was perfect , exactly half sun and half moon , half fire and half ice . He ($_shouto) was descended from gods on both sides , without the limitations either temperature had previously placed on his ($_shouto) parents . King_Endeavor ($_king) brought him ($_shouto) quickly and aggressively under his ($_shouto) tutelage , naming him ($_shouto) his ($_shouto) successor and spending hours every day with him ($_shouto) , teaching him ($_shouto) to use his ($_shouto) powers and how to lead . 
  Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) wasn t cruel , or even rude . He ($_shouto) was just cold .  He ($_shouto) clearly didn t want to be watched like a child , and Inasa ($_inasa) could understand that . He ($_shouto) called Inasa ($_inasa) his ($_shouto) watchdog , and only spoke to Inasa when necessary . He ($_shouto) woke up early , but not as early as Inasa ($_inasa) , and went running every morning . Inasa ($_inasa) trotted behind him ($_shouto) , impressed with the_prince ($_shouto) s stamina but not terribly troubled to keep up . A lifetime of arduous farmwork bolstered his ($_shouto) lung capacity and leg strength , and it ($_inasa) was clear that King_Endeavor ($_king) had wanted a strong man as a bodyguard not only to protect the_prince ($_shouto) but also to keep him ($_shouto) from setting too quick a pace and running away under his ($_shouto) nose . He ($_shouto) could put up with any rebellious prince for them . 
 He ($_shouto) could hear the bath water running . The sound of the rushing water was soothing , and Inasa ($_inasa) imagined that he ($_shouto) was the one in the hot water , sloughing off the aches of the_day ($_the) . He ($_shouto) thought of his ($_shouto) parents and young siblings , and steeled himself ($_shouto) . 
 Don ($_don) t worry , he ($_don) barred all the windows in my chambers years ago . I was rebellious even before I went to school . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) crossed the room to the entrance to the bathroom , shutting the door behind him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) looked around and found that the windows were indeed barred off . 
 I m going to bathe , he ($_shouto) said . Dare I ask if the king s instructions include accompanying me into the bath as well ? 
 Thank you . You are free to go . The chambermaids exited , and Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) turned back to Inasa . The robe , untied at the waist , revealed his ($_shouto) body , naked except for black briefs and the markings that extended down his ($_shouto) chest . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) walked back toward his ($_shouto) bed , tying the robe at the waist , covering his ($_shouto) muscular legs . 
 The chambermaids entered in their fluttery mob to dress the prince for bed ; their deft fingers undid the complex ties and buttons in his ($_shouto) outfit , stripping him ($_shouto) quickly . He ($_shouto) stepped out of his ($_shouto) pants and one of the chambermaids pulled his ($_shouto) red robe seemingly out of thin air and slipped it on to his ($_shouto) slender shoulders . 
  What training have you done , to keep up with me ? he ($_shouto) asked .  I ve been running faster every_day ($_every) . I m not even really trying to get away , I m just impressed , I suppose . Inasa ($_inasa) grinned , in spite of himself ($_shouto) . A lifetime of farmwork could impress a prince with a lifetime of combat training . He ($_shouto) was a few days , a week perhaps , into his ($_shouto) time with the prince when he ($_shouto) brought it up . 
 

($_natsuo)	King_Endeavor ($_king) took Princess Rei to a new planet , cooler than the_Sun_Gods_' ($_the) planet and warmer than the moon clan planet , named Amaterasu , where many Sun God worshippers lived , and wed her ($_natsuo) , ruling over the citizens with her ($_natsuo) as his reluctant queen . She ($_natsuo) bore him four children and named them after the moons of her ($_natsuo) home planet ; Touya , Fuyumi , Natsuo ($_natsuo) , and Shouto . King_Endeavor ($_king) exiled them in turn to the moon clan s planet , the first three children being unsatisfactory to him ($_king) . 
 

($_king)	King_Endeavor ($_king) considered him ($_shouto) for a moment as they ($_king) approached a set of massive ebony doors at the end of a long passageway . Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chambers , Inasa ($_inasa) thought , marveling at the dark wood and the intricate designs carved into its ($_king) surface . 
  Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , King_Endeavor ($_king) said after a long pause . I ($_shouto) am expecting a war to begin in the near future .  Do not let Shouto ($_shouto) out of your sight . You will receive your compensation on the first of every month . King_Endeavor ($_king) pushed open the left ebony door with a fiery palm . King_Endeavor ($_king) took Princess Rei to a new planet , cooler than the_Sun_Gods_' ($_the) planet and warmer than the moon clan planet , named Amaterasu , where many Sun God worshippers lived , and wed her ($_natsuo) , ruling over the citizens with her ($_natsuo) as his reluctant queen . She ($_natsuo) bore him four children and named them after the moons of her ($_natsuo) home planet ; Touya , Fuyumi , Natsuo ($_natsuo) , and Shouto . King_Endeavor ($_king) exiled them in turn to the moon clan s planet , the first three children being unsatisfactory to him ($_king) . 
  There were kings on every planet surrounding every star in their galaxy , but none were as notorious as King_Endeavor ($_king) . He ($_god) was a God , literally . He ($_god) was known as a harsh king , but popular to the Sun God worshippers who were under the rule of one of the icons they had prayed to for generations before he ($_god) appeared in the flesh to lead them . They were blinded by the light of the Sun God flame . The rest of the galaxy knew better than to deal too often with him ($_god) , for fear of getting burned . A war ? Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) asked . Inasa ($_inasa) looked up as well . King_Endeavor ($_king) had said something to him ($_inasa) on his ($_inasa) first day , but when month passed without another mention of it ($_king) , he ($_inasa) figured it ($_king) had been an intimidation tactic . 
 It was no way to live , at either end of the temperature spectrum . King_Endeavor ($_king) left the planet of the_Sun_Gods ($_the) and bargained with the moon clan , taking the eldest royal daughter to be his bride in exchange for a single , eternally flickering flame , kept in the town center , that could provide heat in the coldest months , with their distant star barely keeping them alive . 
 They were quiet a long time , Prince Shouto writing and Inasa ($_inasa) considering the fact that this was simultaneously the easiest and most disconcerting way to earn money he ($_inasa) d experienced in his ($_inasa) life . The quiet was uneasy , and Inasa ($_inasa) knew that the peace could be disrupted at any moment , by King_Endeavor ($_king) or criminals or - 
 Ah , Inasa ($_inasa) said . A marriage of convenience , just like King_Endeavor ($_king) s own . His friend from school that the king had deemed to be the most advantageous ally , what with the boundless raw materials of Creati ($_creati) , the deal likely struck before they graduated . He wondered if Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) loved her . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) left his ($_inasa) home and caught the next starship toward Amaterasu ($_amaterasu) , King_Endeavor ($_king) s planet . Rumors swirled of him ($_inasa) building a royal guard , his ($_inasa) need for strong young men to protect what belonged to him ($_inasa) . 
  Hayate is old enough and strong enough to handle the farms now , he ($_inasa) said , referring to his ($_inasa) younger brother who had recently returned home from school . And our family is in desperate need of money . If I work for King_Endeavor ($_king) I ll be able to send back enough for you to pay for your medicine and to be able to keep our lights on . Their planet was running technologically behind many in their system and galaxy due to the intensity of the storms , which caused struggles for their elders . Inasa ($_inasa) hoped to one day move his parents across the solar system to a safer planet where they could comfortably live the rest of their lives . With the little money he made selling his crops , that would never be a possibility . Inasa ($_inasa) endured the grueling training process and heavy interviewing and vetting , displaying his ($_inasa) wind abilities and his ($_inasa) physical prowess , knowing he ($_inasa) was strong enough to be included in the royal guard . After a few weeks , he ($_inasa) was called to the king s chambers and told that he ($_inasa) was chosen as a bodyguard for King_Endeavor ($_king) . Inasa ($_inasa) bowed deeply . For the pay , he ($_inasa) d do anything to protect what King_Endeavor ($_king) asked him ($_inasa) to . 
 The other students poisoned his ($_shouto) mind , King_Endeavor ($_king) said gruffly as he ($_shouto) led Inasa to the prince s chambers . He ($_shouto) thinks he ($_shouto) can just disappear and run off with his ($_shouto) friends and see the galaxy . A cape of flames surrounded the King . It was difficult to stand too close to him ($_shouto) . Inasa ($_inasa) couldn t help but think that he ($_shouto) could understand why a young prince just introduced to the outside world might want to leave King_Endeavor ($_king) and return to it ($_king) with the friends he ($_shouto) d made . 
 The_Earl ($_the) nodded , trembling . Y-yes , Your Highness . It s no secret that King_Endeavor ($_king) wants to control the t-textile industry , even if he ($_shouto) does start a w-war . Beads of sweat rolled down the_Earl ($_the) s face . The room was suddenly boiling hot , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s left side steaming . 
 Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was his ($_shouto) masterpiece . He ($_shouto) was perfect , exactly half sun and half moon , half fire and half ice . He ($_shouto) was descended from gods on both sides , without the limitations either temperature had previously placed on his ($_shouto) parents . King_Endeavor ($_king) brought him ($_shouto) quickly and aggressively under his ($_shouto) tutelage , naming him ($_shouto) his ($_shouto) successor and spending hours every day with him ($_shouto) , teaching him ($_shouto) to use his ($_shouto) powers and how to lead . 
 These legends , stories Inasa ($_inasa) had heard over and over growing up , were why his ($_god) parents were so incredulous when he ($_god) walked in from the fields one afternoon , hung up his ($_god) hat , and announced he ($_god) was leaving home to work for King_Endeavor ($_king) . 
  He ($_shouto) clearly didn t want to be watched like a child , and Inasa ($_inasa) could understand that . He ($_shouto) called Inasa ($_inasa) his ($_shouto) watchdog , and only spoke to Inasa when necessary . He ($_shouto) woke up early , but not as early as Inasa ($_inasa) , and went running every morning . Inasa ($_inasa) trotted behind him ($_shouto) , impressed with the_prince ($_shouto) s stamina but not terribly troubled to keep up .

($_duchess)	My , Shouto ($_shouto) , I didn t realized His ($_shouto) Majesty knew what your ty - Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) began before Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) cut her ($_inasa) off with only a look . 
 It ($_inasa) is an honor , Your Grace , Inasa ($_inasa) said , hoping that he ($_inasa) had addressed her ($_inasa) properly . Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) smiled kindly before turning to the Prince . 
  Sir Inasa , this is my betrothed , Duchess Momo Yaoyorozu of Creati ($_creati) . We attended academy together and King Endeavor thought it to be a good match . Duchess Momo , this is my new bodyguard , Sir_Inasa ($_inasa) , Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) said in introduction . Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) held her ($_duchess) hand out daintily and Inasa ($_inasa) gave it a perfunctory kiss . Creati ($_creati) was a planet in Inasa ($_inasa) s home planet s system , ore-rich land making them the manufacturing center of their system . Inasa ($_inasa) had done trade with them many times in his life . Does Her ($_duchess) Grace live in the palace , Your ($_duchess) Your_Highness ($_highness) ? Inasa ($_inasa) asked one day , as they ($_inasa) ended their ($_inasa) walk at Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) s chamber doors as always and Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) walked away , always in gorgeous dresses that fit her ($_duchess) perfectly and were striking to the eye . That day she ($_duchess) was in green , tiny flowers decorating the long sleeves that extended past her ($_duchess) hands and trailed behind her ($_duchess) on the floor . 
 No , she ($_duchess) lives in a home nearby . Her ($_duchess) family from her ($_duchess) home planet will move into that house after we marry . His voice softened at the end , apprehensive at his own mention of the wedding . 
 Afternoons were spent in meetings , a blur of faces from the court that Inasa ($_inasa) would bow to and promptly forget . Evenings were spent at dinner and then in long walks around the palace with Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) . She ($_duchess) seemed to be the prince s main confidant , and Inasa ($_inasa) was glad that Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) was going to wed a woman he ($_shouto) was , at the very least , friends with , even if he ($_shouto) wasn t happy with his ($_shouto) father s arrangements . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) watched them approach the doors to Prince Shouto s chambers and his ($_shouto) face heated . The two spoke for another moment before Duchess_Momo ($_duchess) pulled Prince_Shouto ($_shouto) into a tight hug and walked away . Inasa ($_inasa) blinked . A hug was somewhat untraditional for a betrothed pair . He ($_shouto) had expected a pair of bows , or perhaps a curtsy and a kiss of the hand . 
 

($_your)	Yes , Your_Majesty ($_your) . 
 Instead he ($_shouto) simply responded , Yes , Your_Majesty ($_your) , and bowed . 
 

($_rei)	He ($_shouto) allowed Rei ($_rei) to return home once a year to visit her family . Rei ($_rei) brought Shouto ($_shouto) with her ($_shouto) one year after a few hours of begging . Shouto ($_shouto) clinged to her ($_shouto) leg and barely spoke to his estranged siblings , hiding behind Rei ($_rei) as she ($_shouto) spoke in low tones to her ($_shouto) mother over the flame in the town square . As she ($_shouto) boiled a cup of water for tea , it was said that she ($_shouto) , disgusted at the sight of her ($_shouto) own son s Sun God ($_god) half , tipped the boiling water into his ($_god) face . 
 

($_amaterasu)	I ($_shouto) expect you to spend all of your time by my ($_shouto) son s side . You will protect him from any intruders , as well as from himself . He should not leave Amaterasu ($_amaterasu) . Even better if he does not leave the palace . 
 Inasa ($_inasa) left his ($_inasa) home and caught the next starship toward Amaterasu ($_amaterasu) , King_Endeavor ($_king) s planet . Rumors swirled of him ($_inasa) building a royal guard , his ($_inasa) need for strong young men to protect what belonged to him ($_inasa) .
